    "text": " sure is. Morning everyone. So we'll crack straight into it. So we have three applications that we've reviewed for the District Promotion Fund. We did have a Community Event Fund application come through in the beginning for the Likinwa Picnic Memorial but that's since cancelled so we didn't go any further with that one.  So basically we've looked at the three applications that have come in and we're basically giving partial funds or recommending partial funds to all of them. So starting with the Wake National Championships, so they've had great success over previous years, so this is not a new event.  There will be some economic benefit with people coming to participate in that one. We thought it would be worth offering a portion of it. So they've asked for $4,000, but we're recommending $2,000.  Cracking straight into the dressage event, that's a three-day event, so quite a good economic benefit for that one. And people come from the North and South Island for that one. So basically it's, yeah, it's, I think the second year running.  yeah, second time running for that event. And I think it was noted that the crowds that they attracted for the event last year were really substantial for that particular venue out at Takapoto Estate. So that's really exciting. And I guess it's just a unique event for the district, something a bit different being dressage. It's not sporting or  the other usual horsing events. So there'll be some definite recognition, great recognition of the Home of Champs branding there as well. But we did think that the amount that they were asking probably didn't quite give us the return that we were looking for. So they did ask for 7,000, but we're recommending 3,000.  And then I'll just finish up with the Big Air National. So this is a really exciting event for the district, an extreme sporting event, which will be very, very new. And it was going to be obviously alongside the Kiwi Expo.  But Jed Mildon is hoping to continue on with that. If he can't go ahead with his dates of the 5th to the 7th of November, he'll be looking to postpone that, hopefully.  So yeah, we expect that there'd be quite a large number should COVID allow, spectators that is. But yeah, great, great event to align with the Home of Champions branding. And yeah, something really cool and different for the district. So we thought we'd, yeah,  Again, pretty high for what they were asking, 6,000. And just aligning it with the other events that we were looking at, I think we've recommended 2,000, which was kind of in line with what we were looking at with the others. So if we can just have a discussion around the three, we'll go back to the Wake Championships. What does everyone think about that?",

Yeah. And I'm going to take it, I guess, really, that the Big Ear would attract young people. I mean, it's probably more that demographic. But when I look at Jed Meldon, 45,000 followers on his  Instagram and things like that. I mean, that's massive. And he's a Nitro Circus rider, I believe as well. So yeah, it would be great if he, now I know he lives in Tauranga, so not that far away. But if he could, you know, look to do more events in Waipa, hey, that would be pretty fantastic.

At Takapoto, everything's on site. So, you mentioned a huge benefit and I think you could be correct there.

Yes, and I've asked a couple of times just to see what we could do, but the rules are pretty, I think, steadfast on that.  But, I mean, we would certainly work through. Yeah, I'm unsure if that would have to go back to Council as a request to change that, or if we obviously work through with the event organiser if their date were to change to reapply come that next financial year. Discussions I've had with a couple of events that are postponing to that 12-month mark, up from the original date, they understand that they would need to reapply and they haven't  put any concern back to us. They've kind of accepted it and said that they'd be in touch close to the right time. So it might be something I need to discuss further with governance to see what we could do.

And essentially we are, you know, of course, we only have a set fund. And if we don't spend it and it's not rolled over, you know, we're not investing, you know, back into this industry, you know, post COVID. And I think that there's something, and I look around the world, that sector's always been the most affected. And it seems to me that's where a lot of councils, a lot of other countries are putting a lot more energy into. But we're kind of shortchanging ourself by not rolling that money's over.  and investing, you know, we're not even just spending what we would have spent. In fact, we're, you know, shortchanging ourselves in a sense. So I'm wondering if we can maybe take this, you know, to finance, talk to the team there and see if we perhaps can look at a better way of doing this.",

For that far out as well, so that would be something we would need to discuss with this topic around rolling over an allocation to another financial year, whether or not we can allocate. I think we've had this discussion before too, if we can look to allocate or set aside funding for an event that we know is coming in two or three years time.  Yeah, I think this has been discussed, I think, given when we had World Masters Games. Don't have an answer for it, but at that time with World Masters Games as an example, we did put a paper to Exec at the time.  this is really testing my memory, to exec and then through to council for a new budget line for that leveraging for the World Masters Games. So when we have the real big international stuff that we've got time up our sleeve for in a year's time, two years, three years time, we do look to process that ahead of time where we can, but obviously the district promotion budget is  has its 12-month process, so we probably need to look into that. And now we've got COVID on our hands, it's probably the really good time to actually see how we can action things moving forward, because we didn't have this two or three years ago, obviously, and these rules have been around the way they are for quite a while.

Thanks, Amber, you too, Quinn. Okay, so I'll just go through the list where we're at for now. So with the district promotion events, we've had seven and a half cancellations out of 34, and I'm being very specific here, because I'd like some optimism in this list.  The one that's the half, we'll start with that one, are the CrossFit Nationals. So they've got the team champs and the individual champs. One that was meant to be in October, one is set for December, so they've obviously cancelled the October physical event. So that one is out. As of yesterday, we had the 100K Flyer, or end of last week, 100K Flyer cancelled, and Culinary Cambridge has cancelled, although for that particular one, some restaurants are still hosting mini events. Yep, I think I've got that right, Philip.  Kiwigrass pulled the plug, I think it was around when we went into lockdown August, start of September. The Ahaup\u014d Light Show gala, which would have been a new event for us but have had to pull the plug. Armistice in Cambridge, which is a big one to lose for the first time for a  for this, well, not for this reason in particular, but for the people in that particular, do we call it industry, interest level? It's quite a shame for that one. We've obviously had quite a few of them asking if they can host mini events in November around the town, so we've connected them up with the community board to see what else they could do. Porongia Craft Fair, which is the huge 10,000 strong event in Porongia, that was a real blow, but the volunteers there  really needed to consider what they could achieve and there's no way that they could have done that.  and an outside venue. And the great Kiwi Summer Expo has been postponed to its first year for next year, which will be the best spot for it, I think. So although a lot of these organizers have been really disappointed with making the call, Claire and I have been kind of just in that supportive space saying, look, we will come back from this. It is going to take time, but we're here to support you guys and work through plans moving forward, ensuring that we're helping with connections and things like that as well.  Post-bindments in that space, we've had four out of the 34 so far. Over 40s Football Tournament, Gin Credible, Point Break Super Boat, Wake Surf Comp, which was a part of the, or was being hosted at the same weekend as the Summer Expo, and Te Amo Rowing Club. So those four are, at the moment, toying with new dates. So we'll keep you guys posted as we see updates from them. They are looking for the new year.  February is actually looking incredibly busy. Claire's comment before about how our condensed year may look. So at the start of August, we had about six or seven events in October. Lockdown hit for those first two or three weeks and October ended up having 17 events in it. And then as of this week, we've had one and we've got one  possibly locked in for the 30th with the speedway opening night and fireworks, but obviously that will be up in the air at this stage. So yeah, we went from about five to eight, 17 was our peak, and yeah, back down to two. So February, from that, people are pushing out to the new year. So February is currently our big month. So don't talk to us then, basically.  So with the community events we are seeing less cancellations in this space. Obviously with some of these events their budgets are smaller so there's a little bit less risk in terms of them making the calls early or earlier than what the District Promotion Fund scale events have been. But the three cancellations we've had were the stragglers car show and family day  Flowers of the Future, although I was advised at the time that that wasn't cancelled due to COVID, it was due to other reasons, and Gitbox, the theater show in Te Amat\u016b, is also being pulled at this stage. And two events that are postponed at this point are the Porongia Trail Run, they're looking at February, and the Cambridge Half Marathon is currently looking at November from memory. But again, we've got to just see how we go for the next few weeks. So there are a lot,  of cancellations there. There are a lot of postponements, but people are still, I'm finding anyway, still quite optimistic about taking this time to be planning things, creating new ideas, making new connections. So there is kind of this background movement of people still doing the mahi to get that work done, to keep processing things along, although they can't physically host their events. So yeah, it's pretty hard on a lot of industries. I know Claire and I have been  Busting it to get some of these events off the ground and every week we're getting the update and it's quite disappointing to say. A lot of this you know backroom work that never gets seen until the event happens isn't being seen and we're having to either repeat it in six months time or it's just gone down the toilet because we haven't been able to execute with the event organizer so it's been hard a few weeks but.  we've just got to support these guys and make sure that they know that they're not the only ones having to pull the pin if they are in that difficult position. So yeah, I hope it gives them optimism. Bring on 2022. I think I said that in 2020 about 2021, but we'll see how we go. Yeah.",
