And I thought, this is actually a meeting where we're going to have hard yards. And that probably, Jim, is not that exciting. And yet, I think as we consider some of the stuff, we are laying the foundation  for a good year. So I hope for all of you folk that are engaged, I hope you can actually see this as being a really important meeting when we look at the agenda as it's being prepared by Ken and the team. The other thing is that I just wanted to pick up on, and I just signal it now, I want to pick up on some of the challenges. I think in ensuring that the rest of your elected member colleagues  have the full understanding and confidence in what we do as a committee in terms of managing risk. And I know there is one particular paper on that, but there's a couple of other matters that I noted through the agenda. Where Ken, I would be keen that at the end of it, perhaps we just work out, while we know we're doing good business, how do we help our elected members deal with that? And my final point, I guess, is firstly, again, I've mentioned Ken and the team.  Just thank you to staff for the papers. I think they're, again, a very superb set, easy to review, and in my view, should enable us to have the right focus and to be able to discuss and get assurance. So with that, without further ado, apologies. Roger, I think you've got to go at two, is that correct?  Yep, I don't know whether you've got your, you think you might have your microphone off, but I've seen your hand wave, and Claire, you're absent from one through 1.30, or there or thereabouts. So, let's bring it. So I think otherwise, I've had no other indications. So look, I'll just move that we sustain those apologies. Could I have a seconder, please? I'll be looking your way a lot today, Jim. All those in favour, please say aye. Those against, it's carried. Thank you very much.  Members' interests, are there any matters that we're discussing? We've also got the interest register and public excluded, but are there any matters that cause you concern around your interests? There being none, I move on to any late items. I haven't had any notice of late items, Ken, so we will carry on. Members, there's nothing that we need to extraordinarily consider.  Fine. Confirmation of the order of the meeting. At this stage, anticipate going through as we have scheduled in the agenda. At 11.30, I hope that the auditors, Leon Pettisy, our Audit Director, will join us. And at 12.50, that's 10 to 1, we'll have a short presentation from Diana MacDonald, who is from Aon.  insurance, who are the last brokers. And Ken, thank you for arranging this. It would be good for us to hear from them about the insurance market at the moment. It's pretty relevant. Otherwise, I think the program is pretty much as we anticipate. Claire, I know that you are trying to go out and come back. That means that probably you're missing the exciting\u2014well, you probably will miss that  in the exciting issue of outstanding management report items. So. Yeah, I'm gutted.",

One thing I'd like to do, Jenny, as we go through these, and I do think we should go them risk by risk, the 13 of them, is that I'd like to encourage members to have a look at the risk appetite section. I'm not trying to skip over the second appendix, but the reality of it is,  that we are in going through these line or page by page, we're actually also in effect clearing the risk appetite. So I think that's actually really, really important. And indeed, some of them might seem a tad counterintuitive. So I think we should actually just have that discussion as we go through, if that's okay.  Jenny. So before we hook in, and I must confess, we wanted to take it as read.

I just love the work that's been done here. Actually, Jenny, it's fantastic.  We have had an instance, actually, where we've had a complaint from a mana whenua group that relates to the way council interacts with them that's got absolutely nothing to do with post-treaty settlements. Yeah, I'd just like to point that out as well. So I don't know if, well, I guess it is covered there, actually, yeah.

So clear I am on, thank you for your comments, I am on page 27, and I always like a diagram. So the heat maps always help me heaps.  And I'd just like to reflect as what I saw as I read this, and it may be that Jenny or George, you wanna correct me. I'm interested to see the movement that we anticipate firstly through those group business plans to mitigate and therefore lower the residual risk. In other words, make it safer for us. We're more likely to meet our objectives. I'm also interested  that actually for some of them, we anticipate controls that will reduce the risk lower. So that's good. We can talk over that one as well. But actually what I would like you to also think as we go through this are those which are in that sort of navy blue.  almost an Otago colour, well done, where we have the initial mitigants and they will stay at a level. There is no further action that moves them into that sort of pinky colour and lower.  So here goes the first hint at some of the risk settings we are prepared to adopt. I think it's fair to say, Jenny, correct me as I say if I've got this one wrong. So I would be very interested in ultimately the committee's view about the reasonableness of those settings. Everything gets moved out of the sort of the red danger zone, if I can call it that.  It means those that are navy blue tend to be in that fringe between the yellow, orange, and light red, whereas those for which we have identified even more action, they'll move into the safer area, if I can call it that, the less risk-taken area of green. So it's somewhere down the track. We're gonna have to make certain as we go through this that we're broadly happy with that. Okay, thank you. So look, let's move to,  First, appetite, adequate staffing, capacity and capability to deliver Council's objectives. Any comments on this? Jenny or George, anything you need to help us with at the moment? Can you help me please with something which I presume is something you guys use here? Maximise SNAPHIRE. What's SNAPHIRE? It sounds great. I take it you say it's SNAPHIRE. Is it an HR type system, is it?",

I totally appreciate what Jenny and Gary have mentioned about the difficulty in attracting certain people to fill roles.

I think you're right, Jim, is that certainly in our Three Waters area, there is a high level of risk in terms of delivering the services and delivering the capital works programme. However, if I think in the transport area, we've got a number of key projects, particularly crossings of the Greenbelt in Cambridge.  which again are key enablers of development, but subject to processes that are quite complex. So I think there are facets of complexity and risk across the programme of work that we're delivering. So yeah, I think we could go to a lot of work and sort of disaggregate them, but we may well end up with a similar sort of a profile.",

And the other, the real thing I wanted to say is that in the key risk indicators, there's nothing about staff stress, okay, like the number of sick days that are being taken, or if you know particular roles that are under pressure,  number of resignations or people on stress leave like those would be you know what I'd call lead indicators or something and is that going to be part of the suite of risk indicators for this particular risk?",

And while we have a dominance of Zoom, and can I, by the way, again, the risk of making it appear that I'm having a crack at people that aren't in the room, probably half my meetings at the moment are by Zoom.  because of the lockdown situation. I've got Auckland tomorrow and we're doing it entirely by Zoom, which again, is not good, actually, but it reflects the, because you've got about 30 people, no, you've got about 50 people in the room for an Auckland one, believe it or not.

So yes, I think if you can leave that one with me, what I'd like to do is set up a regular briefing session between exec and councillors so that  you can grill us about the sorts of issues that are concerning you and we can come up with what I hope are appropriate responses. So I do have an idea in the back of my mind that I want to set up a regular forum between councillors and the executive team so that we can deal with any issues that are front of mind.

And it's something that we're really gonna have to bring our A game to the table on, especially as these RMA reforms roll out. And also,  In respect of the waters debate, there's this tension between, do we work to maximise the advantages for ratepayers through a new arrangement, which is, I suspect, where the government wants us to be, and the tension between that and  you know predominantly rural provincial council saying we really don't want a bar of this reform so so there's still that that underlying question to answer and and you know the executive is in a really delicate position here yeah where it's being invited to the table to talk about structuring an entity to benefit our ratepayers when i don't think the council is at that position yet so there are there are political risks uh and  And it's all unfolding at a time when we're trying to prepare an LTP. So we'll be landing an LTP with this council in March next year, when we should be receiving signals from the government about what's going to happen in the Three Waterspace. And that could alter depending on what the outcome of the election result is. So there are just a whole bunch of external factors going on here that are completely out of our control.  And it's a really risky environment to be working in if you're on the exec team and trying to get bits of work, you know, positioned in your mind so that you then get the level of engagement right that aligns with your council's needs and desires, which is at odds with where central government is here.

So again, looking at that risk,  We're having to accept a high level of risk given, again, the strong externalities around this, correct? Our approach will be that we are going to look it in the face and we're going to, according to the mitigations, beef up our abilities in the form of a principal policy advisor. But that still means that we have to tolerate high risk given the external  conditions that we face. Have I got that correct, Gary? Yes, but also remember, sorry, I didn't make the point at the start of when I started to talk, but there's real tension here between what the shape of local government will be and the sorts of things this council is trying to achieve.",

Yeah, I vaguely recall that that actually is now being dissolved or certainly scaled down.

So I'm not sure if that's still relevant. And I would like some clarity around the difference between under the mitigation, significant mitigations.

Although we have had some very useful discussions in the last week with the chair of Te Waka and indicated, you know, the one big thing that they could get across the line for us in terms of  you know, what does success look like for Te Waka? It's leveraging provincial growth fund money. Often, Clare, I think about tangata whenua relationships on two levels. One is the trust boards where we have treaty obligations and very high level, quite formal type presentations. And the other is engagement at hapu level, which is more in the Ng\u0101iwi, T\u014dpou and Waip\u0101 space.  And that tends to be where most of the useful work for us gets done, especially when you start to develop district plans and when you think about the strategy we've got for the next LTP, that is to build spatial planning, that sort of stuff.

And I'm sure that senior staff, Gary, if there was any incident that indicated that  the relationship was not as it should be with one of our key stakeholders actually be resolved immediately without delay. It would be a priority and not waiting for a year for it to show up in a resident survey.

It means actually, presumably, that we are going to push forward where we can with some level of risk fiscally or financially.  It also means that presumably we're wanting to preserve our balance sheet to be able to give us any suspension in terms of risk. In other words, use our debt to the extent that we've got debt available, or perhaps use of reserves. So we're prepared to take a level of risk, which means that we might have to use some of our, in quotation marks, fat, close quotation marks, so that we can move forward.

    "text": "Thanks, Bruce. I'd just like to make two comments, and I accept that they might not be well received.  The first one is that from an analytical point of view, one of the contributors to financial sustainability risk is that council doesn't have an independent, I suppose, source of revenue, like an enterprise that they've started and they'll get dividends or some kind of revenue from it, because this council's always just seen themselves as able to raise all the money they need  from either rates or fees and charges. Perhaps it's time to consider what business they could start up or in conjunction with other councils so that they might have an independent revenue stream. The second point is that could there be a mitigant to the constraints we have on debt by looking at the way  our rating agency assesses us. So doing some work with them to understand more deeply how they arrive at their credit rating in a way that we could reclassify our debt and things like that, just so that it might actually give us more ability to give us that free board to actually increase the amount that we could be  borrowing. Now, I don't, I haven't talked to Ken about that, I don't know if he's considered something like that, just of my experience. In my experience with the finance sector, you know, I used to work for the ANZ bank at the head office and there were formulas that were used and things like that and sort of  accepted ways of doing things. But when you get a point like this and it's time to actually have a harder look at how things actually work, sometimes, you know, just asking the question or even wanting to have a deeper discussion with the rating agency might actually change things for a lot of councils, not just us.",

All of these rating agencies have pretty rigid sets of rules. They all have international committees, etc., whether it's Moody's, Standard & Poor's, or Fitch.  um yeah you know they all have um have a very similar sort of culture and they have the international committees who actually determine those um those ratings and and a um yeah a very very very strong focus on on independence um so um yeah so um yeah so it's a really difficult to um to to um you know to work directly with them  However, obviously the friend we do have on our side, who does have quite a lot of insight into the way the rating agencies work, etc., is Baincorp. So we have, in relation to what we're currently working through with the LTP, in terms of that debt to revenue ratio, etc., and what might be the impact on our credit rating,  Yes, look, we are certainly having conversations with Earl White of Bancorp in regard to that, and just trying to see what the factors are that those rating agencies would be looking at.  quite closely. But just reiterating, you can't really cozy up with a rating agency by nature. They are very, very independent, and they have to be, because of course what they are looking to do is to give the investors confidence in terms of the financial stability and structure of the relevant lending party.",

In response to Clare's first point, too, about creating an enterprise to drive revenue, I mean, obviously, that has its own risk.

So, one of the things we intend to bring back to a council workshop tomorrow is a suggestion  I'm not happy with the level of risk we've landed on in the LTP. And what I was going to suggest to the council tomorrow is that we have the master plan and that we need to be consulting about this with governance, iwi, the community, as to the level of capital required and the level of risk they're prepared to  to absorb. On the back of that, we can also stitch in a, so here is what the Crown's suggesting and interested to obtain community feedback so that when it comes to the March announcement by the Crown, we then positioned ourselves so that we can then start to communicate with our community and feed that into the next round of discussions with the Crown.",

We're sitting on $1.7 billion worth of assets, and we really have to maintain those. And with the significant drop in revenue, the big push in the water spend, the growth we're facing, there's very little capacity to deliver these projects that are near and dear to our community's heart. So we consult on some magnificent projects that are relatively low capital cost, and then we go back and say, well, actually, we can't afford them.  And there's a massive risk to the Council's reputation in doing that. So, what I hope to do tomorrow with the Council is to bring back a range of opportunities for us to think about, and if money becomes available through those opportunities, then let's prioritise these community projects and start to deliver them. So, I absolutely accept that there's a huge risk to the Council in failing to deliver these high-profile community projects that are relatively low capital cost in the big scheme of things.  with the capital works program around between 80 and 100 million dollars a year there must be some scope within which we can find some money and that's what I'll be talking to the council tomorrow.",

Colorful, Ken, as I think you put it out to me in my prayer general on the COVID debrief. Thank you. It was an insight. And that's one of the reasons I asked that question, sorry, by the way, was having read the debrief that we dealt with in the policy, particularly, or the plan, sorry, particularly the bank funding issue.  Are there any other comments? And I'm sorry, there might be the COVID response in the previous one. I'm not gonna try and reopen the agenda, but are there any other comments from the committee that they'd like to make at this stage, please? Right, so I have a motion that we, again, I think it's double-barrelled, that we receive it, and secondly, that we endorse E.T. adopt it. Moved by Jim, seconded by Claire, if I recall correctly. All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Aye.  Those against? It's carried. Thank you very much. Right, I'm gonna tick these items off rather than rely on my sight. Thank you, George and Jenny. Very, very helpful leads. Can we get deal with the interim management report, please? Sarah, welcome. Is there any comment you'd like to make? Well, I open it up to good old Leon at the back.",

Some of the key highlights that we've picked up was that the internal control environment was effective for our audit purposes, so we're happy with the control environment. As Sarah has mentioned, we did identify three areas for improvement. I won't go into those. We also followed up on matters that we raised in previous management reports. There are still eight matters that continue to remain open.  nine matters will be followed up as part of our final audit that is in process at the moment.

We promised you verbal clearance by 11 September which is last Friday. Now we just received the annual report today so we're going to try and turn that around by latest Wednesday which is the next date I promised Ken but it may slip  Again, sorry, I haven't been able to update you on this, but then that'll be the end of the week by latest. I think that's the bad news story of this whole thing.  Also, Cat just explained the COVID assessment that's been done by council. That was really good. The last bit about COVID that we need to do is look at the annual report and the final annual report and just look at the disclosures. I don't foresee any issues, but it is an outstanding at the moment. In our annual plan or audit plan, we mentioned a few items that we're gonna look at. The one was property plant and equipment.  And we specifically mentioned revaluations. And you referred to the table on page 168 of your pack, Mr. Chair, about when revaluations are supposed to happen. So land and buildings did happen this year. It's got a carrying value of about 330 million and went up by about 25 million.  that was done by QB. That was within our expectations, so we did the work. I told you in a few meetings ago how much extra work we do on it, and in a COVID environment, trust me, we did even more, and we're comfortable with that re-evaluation.  Then you've got infrastructure assets that's only due next year. Now, because of the COVID, the impact of COVID, we did see quite a bit of movement in commodity prices. So we were quite interested to see what the valuers came up with because they did fair value assessments as a revaluation was not required. We were comfortable with the fair value assessments. I think it was BECCA and WSP.  and the work done by management. So we're comfortable that the carrying value of about 1.5 billion of infrastructure assets reflect the fair value as well within materiality boundaries. The last revaluation, we looked at two more. The other one was investment properties. There was a balance of about 16 million, moved up by about 260,000. That makes sense as well, especially in a growth council like yourself.  And then we looked at the forestry towards where Councillor Clare lives. You've got some forestry assets and yeah, we were overall comfortable with that as well. That is the whole property plant and equipment intangible biological assets and the revaluation around that. So overall, we're comfortable with that. Before I move on, are there any questions on that?",

It's something we mentioned in our audit plan, so I just have to mention it now. I'm not going to go into detail because it won't impact on your annual report at all. The next item in our audit plan was capital works program. Now, you've explained this so well in your agenda pack under risk management. I think it's  the second of your top risks. So I'm not going to go into that because that is really well explained. There was quite a bit of, not quite a bit, there was quite an increase in your work in progress from about 45 million to almost 110 million, which is expected. Again, was no surprise to us. So we just had a look at  Whatever has been capitalized should be capitalized. It meets the definition of a capital expense and it's not an operating expense. This is also reflected in your borrowings increase, of course. Lastly, that wasn't the plan, was the risk of management override. We did our normal desk and we didn't find any issues of concern.  And then something, oh, we spoke about COVID and something else I was just thinking about was the SSPs. We're not completely done with that work, but why I bring it up is in this COVID environment, we found quite a few issues at different councils. And up to now, we haven't found anything that causes concern, which I thought I should just mention to you, because if you're on Audit and Risk Committee of any other council,  I presume you might have seen some issues found during the audit with the Statement of Service performance.",

    "text": " Yes, I am indeed. So, yeah, happy to lead you through this report, Chair. Yeah, just looking on page 178, or just noting on page 178, I suppose, that this is now the sixth survey that we've had. Yeah, very much following the same line of questioning, because, of course, what we're looking to do here is to determine the change over time.  longitudinal change in perception over the course of the committee's existence. So having that long range in the six surveys certainly helps with that. Without further ado, I'll skip over the next two or three pages and go straight to page 181, where I do just summarize the survey results, which of course are fully contained in an appendix one.  But first thing to note, yes, certainly a very good response rate to the survey. So, we ended up with 17 responses, which was good. All six committee members responded. Now, I do apologise that I think we did have some issues with the tool, which actually led to a couple of the councillors having to complete the survey on multiple occasions.  um we have um we have taken account of your perceptions only once because in fact we did only receive them once but yeah look i'm sorry about um the frustration with some of you um  having to have multiple goes at the survey before those results came through. Yeah, so in terms of the observations, so yeah, so I guess the first bullet point there under brief observations on page 181, so yeah, so definitely when you look at those graphs and particularly look at the very original baseline survey,  And where we are today, you can definitely see that there is a good favorable shift with the results or the bulk of those lines on the graph moving towards the right. Also encouraging that I think you can largely say that there's some good positive shifts between last year and this year as well. So of more recent times.  Yeah, look, there are a couple of unusual outlier results. So, there was, yeah, particularly in that first graph where a couple of council officers and an old member  non-member councillor, i.e. a councillor who's not part of the committee. Yeah, we're quite a way to the left, which was a little bit of a surprise. We'll perhaps take those people into a darkened room and find out. No, no, no, I just jest. Yeah, look, I'm not sure what the reasons for that are, but yeah, I would have hoped that if they are true outliers,  um obviously in the verbatim comments that there could be some suggestions coming through and indeed there are some some suggestions coming through so i think that's um i think that's good and that's healthy um yeah the next um two or three bullet points i'm on page 182 now we're just sort of talking about um yeah the the ratings are good  and, yeah, they are definitely, yeah, definitely a lot of those ratings are at the higher end of the scale. So, yeah, so good to see that. And then, yeah, I guess just leading then to those verbatim comments, which we do pull through in the appendix. So I guess, yeah, two key groupings there. So the, yeah, the first lot are suggestions. So, yeah, there are a number of suggestions there.  about greater participation of managers in these agendas and in these meetings. Yeah, the impacts of central government policy changes, et cetera, impacts of COVID-19, cost benefit, risk appetite considerations, et cetera. So, yeah, so a number of areas of focus here. So I guess when we get into the discussion, yeah, it could be useful to determine if the committee does want to take up some of those suggestions.  But yeah, just rounding out my report, yeah, I mean, really encouraging that in those verbatim comments, that there was really good value seen in a number of matters. Yes, like definitely the top risk exercise, which of itself has become a really robust annual thing, as we actually saw a little bit earlier in the agenda today.  There was a comment there about the KPMG internal audits, so I guess, yeah, getting some insights from some outside experts in regard to how we're doing. Deep dives, etc. Hearing from subject matter experts. Later on in this agenda, we will be hearing from our insurance brokers, which I guess is an example of that.  and people also talking about the value of the general risk discussions with Gary as the CE and with the group managers on a rostered basis. Also obviously value in the interactions between governance and management in this committee  which is probably stronger than it is in some of the other committees of council. So, yeah, so look, I think all up, yeah, all up a very, very good result. I do think this thing is worth a check in once a year. I think we are compiling some good information that shows how we're going. So, yeah, so through the chair, happy to open up to any questions or comments.",

But I'd just like to hopefully, like, we'd need to find out exactly what it was that the feedback was from this survey.  you know, like Treasury management, it's a pretty broad subject.

I think that's a really good suggestion, that if we were to do something that, yeah, perhaps as some sort of interaction with councils first, in terms of particular areas of interest.

And it won't be developed with Council until October, November. And then I go down and look at the community engagement  And we had a logical, very good three-step process, but we're missing out step two, which is to develop an action plan alongside the community.

And I suppose in some ways, with our funding constraints, those issues that the community really like to get involved with are the ones that we can't afford anyway. So in effect, although that's happened,  those nice-to-have projects that I suppose that the community's interested in have been displaced pretty much by the high level of capital works and infrastructure. So whether it's actually going to cause a problem with the community or not, I'm not sure, but from a council or a political perspective, yeah, it's feeling a bit like it's a fait accompli.

As Ken alluded, I'm Deanna McDonald, and Shane Twemlo from Auckland is on the line with us as well.  So we're your insurance brokers, and we've just recently been through a tender process with Waikato Lass, BOP Lass, MW Lass, and including the Hawke's Bay Councils. And we'd like to thank you very much for reappointing us again. That's lovely. So there's a little bit to cover off over the next, I think we've got 30 minutes. Let me know if we need to shorten that time at all. So I'm conscious of time and we'll just keep moving through, but don't hesitate to ask any questions as we go on.  We can move to the first slide, please. So Aon is the broker to approximately 70 councils throughout the country in some varying capacity. And we've had about 15 years experience in the local government sector. We can provide a range of policies dependent on what the council requires and tailor the programme. So that's part of  Shane's job is looking to make sure he gets the right programme placement put in for you. We also work with our global risk consulting team to provide independent advice and further enable your understanding of your risks that council face. Moving to the next one, please. So I don't know, some of you may recognise a couple of these faces.  Ken was in Auckland with us last week when we were doing our marketing of the infrastructure programme to our London and local markets. And he got to meet a lot of these lovely faces. Through the tender process, it was made aware that the council felt throughout the country that we weren't getting out to them enough. And in response, we understood that and we formed a practice group  and this is our lovely leadership team. Steve Kane is hitting this practice team up. He's based in Auckland and has been looking after the Auckland Council for the past few years and predominantly looks after construction as well. Paul McKay has been involved in the local government sector for 15 years. And part of the process of having Steve come on board is looking at that whole succession planning for eventually when Paul decides that he wants to  enjoy his retirement. Matthew Wilson and I are based in Hamilton and we look after yourselves, the winepire team as part of the Waikato Lass, as well as the Bot Lass Group and Hawke's Bay Lass and the MW Lass. So we've got a team of about six people that are predominantly looking after local government in Hamilton. Shane is based in Auckland and looks after your program  placement and design, making sure we get everything right for you all. And Sam is looking at the ways of innovations, different ways that we can look at your risk. Next slide, please. Part of the process, you are all aware that you're involved in the Waikato-Les obviously, but part of that is inclusive of your insurance.  benefiting the wider part of D.C. So certainly you can provide specific policies to council and look at the different types of loss limits, mitigate your claims and look at a collective way of doing your marketing. Also the loss modelling, making sure we're getting the right limits on your policies. I'll pass you over to Shane now and he can talk you through the next few slides.",

    "text": "Thanks Dee.  All right, it's about this time of the year where I get out the crystal ball and start talking about where the kind of market is heading. Unfortunately, the kind of overseas insurers and reinsurers continue to be impacted by very large claims worldwide over the last three years.  In 2019, there was $232 billion worth of natural disaster losses worldwide. Most of those are actually driven by fire, flood and weather related type of issues. Fortunately, there's been very kind of low kind of earthquake losses the last 12 months.  But still there was still 41 events that actually each of those events totaled over a billion dollars kind of US in each kind of loss.  We in New Zealand do not have any kind of New Zealand-owned insurance companies anymore. So every time that the overall international insurance market sneezes, New Zealand tends to catch a cold. If we can go to the next slide, please.  So in terms of locally, the local New Zealand insurance market has been probably hardening here in the last three to four kind of years, and that's predominantly post the earthquakes in Kaikoura.  It started off being only property insurance only, and in the last two years, you've seen kind of increases in public liability, professional indemnity, travel, motor insurance, as the actual rest of the policy kind of lines catch up to where the actual property market actually is. Most of those increases are typically driven by the premium rating attaching to natural disaster exposure.  Council's largest spend is actually in the property insurance portfolio, being infrastructure and both property above ground. The second largest spend is actually on professional indemnity insurance.  PI insurance for councils has been under real stress for the last 10 kind of years, even ignoring the previous claims around leaky homes. The new kind of leaky home claims are actually now being put to the courts in a form of structural defect issues and this is causing multi  million claims kind of losses arising out of all councils in New Zealand in the last three years. Unfortunately, due to the actual legal environment we basically have here, council is always going to be the last man standing. Next slide, please.  So here is a snapshot of the last two years costly kind of natural disasters here in good old Aotearoa. If you look at all of those, those are all storm or floods. With the exception of the Tasman fires back in 2019.  flood claims are becoming... It almost no longer may happen. They are going to happen each and every year. Incidentally, the Timaru hailstorm scared the hell out of everybody, and that came in with a claim of $130 million for one particular storm. Can we just go to the next slide, thanks?  And these are kind of transition slides so you can just click a couple of times and again. Again and again and leave it there. That's great. OK.  So in terms of our role, I mean we are trying to actually have our clients understand their exposures and then actually make an informed choice as to how they want to actually handle those exposures. And that can be a combination of around transferring it to an insurance program or it can be risk management in-house.  we've found over the last 15 years of dealing with local authorities is that traditionally everything was actually moved to an insurance policy. As the market has continued to harden and policy coverage in some areas has actually reduced, giving council the tools to actually handle their exposures in-house  whilst understanding the impact of actually not transferring everything to an insurance program is the way to actually put together the most cost effective risk transfer policy at the end of the day.  It's all about actually removing the uncertainty for council, and at the same time, giving you the information to make an informed choice as to how you actually wish to handle any kind of exposure or risk. Go to the next slide, please.  And once again you can just bring those up. Yep, great. Just back one. OK. In terms of controlling your premium spend, OK.  The single biggest thing you can actually do at the end of the day is to actually understand what you can actually lose in the event of a large natural disaster or a large fire claim. It's all about tailoring the policies to what you can actually use. Do you need to ensure every single asset, every single town hall, community hall,  playground and stuff like that. Because everything you declare as a value has a premium rate attaching to it. The more you declare times the premium rate at the time in the actual insurance market equals the premium you pay at the end of the day. Common, I suppose, levers to control the cost is actually look at increase in policy excesses.  Policy excesses historically for most local authorities have been exceedingly kind of low level.  In the current insurance market, you are receiving premium relief for increasing those policy excesses upwards. But you also need to have a look at your own individual claims history to actually find that kind of tipping point as to claims paid above the policy excess and what you would actually handle internally all on your own.  Let's go to the next slide there, thanks. To kind of illustrate that point, if you can just tap I think twice more. That's great. And one more. Maybe one more. Yep, great, OK.  This is a very simple frequency versus severity type of scale. You are more likely to have lots of small claims, OK? Which is in the blue side at the actual left of the actual graph. Then you are to have a large natural disaster, which is at the extreme kind of right hand. Finding that sweet spot in the  There is the key to not only paying too much premium, but to ensure what you actually need to continue to function as an organization in the event of a very large claim.  It's not only about premium either, it's attracting insurer attention. So no insurers really want to actually be the insurer of choice for a client who is actually making lots of attritional claims, eroding the premium pool that they have. Because at the end of the day, if you erode the premium pool,  with one particular insurer, when they come to pay out the large claim, there is no premium left at the end of the day. So finding that kind of sweet spot in the actual middle to attract insurer attention. And the more insurers you can attract who actually want to quote your program, the more competitive tension you have, which ultimately leads to preferential pricing in this market.  Going to the next slide there. Split these up. So it's all about trying to give councils enough information where they can actually feel they can make an informed choice as to what type of risk transfer program they do actually need. And that's why we spend so much  talking about an update on insurance valuations because they obviously drive the amount of insurance you do actually require. We spend a lot of time talking about what you would actually lose in the event of an actual  major claim or natural disaster, and at the same time, putting you guys in front of the insurers so you can tell the council's story to the actual insurers alongside us. We find having that tripartite insurance arrangement between you guys, us, and the ultimate end insurer is very, very helpful.  not only in the event of premium and coverage, but if there is a claim, they actually understand who you guys are as well. Next page there, please. Deanna. So as part of the tender, we looked at and we advised that we could provide insurable risk profiling",

It was a four-hour workshop, but we actually had to extend this because we couldn't get the right people in the room at the right time, but that's okay. We got there in the end. And we were able to evaluate the council's approach to risk governance, risk management, risk financing, and look at identifying the worst case scenarios so that we can give you more information as far as your  getting the correct insurance, getting the correct cover and the right limits. From this workshop, we will be providing, we're still getting around to finishing this off, but getting the actions for council then to improve the risk profiling and optimise their insurance outcomes. So, we're working through this with the 31 councils that were in the tender.  and we're slowly working our way around. Unfortunately, we've been delayed a wee bit with COVID, but we'll get there. Okay, next slide, please. There's been a lot of talk lately with councils wanting to have a insurance strategy, and part of the risk profiling is part of the whole process. So it's looking at this diagram, you can see the last,  slot in there if you like up in the top left hand corner as you're optimizing insurance. If you go to the first one, the purple one, which is determining your risks and understanding evaluations, defining the risks, that's your first start. So that's where we're going at the moment. We're taking this whole journey with you and looking at making sure your valuations are right, that you understand what risks are involved in your business and how you can mitigate those risks and working your way around.  So, we're looking at moving through to the risk positioning, your financial ability, your willingness to accept risk. So, that's looking at what the council is willing to take on and finance themselves, as opposed to putting that through insurance. So, that's your excess levels and those sorts of things. So, that's the process that we're working through at the moment.  I'm hoping that we've kept within time for you. Are there any questions?",

We have been actually working very hard over the last two years to attract some New Zealand participation back into the underground infrastructure and I'm pleased to advise that there should be at least probably three insurers here in New Zealand potentially providing capacity on the underground infrastructure placement for 2020-2021.  That's good on two fronts because the actual London market and the actual New Zealand market actually move in different premium kind of cycles and  at last reading, the impact on COVID on the actual Lloyds market in London is currently estimated to be somewhere between $75 billion and $105 billion. Lloyds of London has not actually made any money in the last five years,  So there's about 109 markets inside Lloyds of London and most of those are particularly stressed and are talking premium increases anywhere between 10 and 20 percent this year. The attraction of the actual local market providing insurance on the underground infrastructure should offset a lot of that kind of increase.",

Traditionally,  central government has paid 60% of the costs in the event of a natural disaster, providing you can actually prove you can either fund internally the remaining 40% or have an insurance policy standing there as well.  The big difference between what you claim on an insurance policy, which is a reinstatement type of policy compared to what Wellington pay, they will pay for functionality only. So they may not reinstate the actual asset completely.  as long as it is actually working, then that's the extent of payment that they actually stump up with. That is why a number of councils have taken the approach to buy a primary kind of layer insurance policy to take away that kind of uncertainty as to what central government will pay at the end of the day.
