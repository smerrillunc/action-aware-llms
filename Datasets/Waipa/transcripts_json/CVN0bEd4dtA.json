    "text": " Cool, thank you. T\u0113n\u0101 koutou katoa. For those who don't know me, ko Debbie LaSalle is taku rangoa. So yeah, I've been working at Waip\u0101 District Council for a year now. So I was born in Auckland and moved to the mighty Waikato 20 years ago, where I have had my three children and here is where I have remained. So yeah, it's lovely to be here. I haven't met all of you in person, but I hope to do so. That would be great.  So just here to talk to you today about COVID-19. So as an organisation, council is considering how we will approach recovery from this quite remarkable event, which has impacted all of our lives. So initially we've been monitoring the economic data and just keeping a close eye on the economic productions for the district.  In Waip\u0101 we're a little bit better off than other districts because our economy is based quite predominantly on the farming sector, which hasn't been hit as hard as some of the other sectors. We are still expecting unemployment to rise though and our hospitality industry has taken quite a big hit. Over the next 12 months we're expecting that house prices will drop and both residential and non-residential construction will drop as well.  So we've also started meeting with our local community and that includes iwi authorities in Hap\u016b, just to talk to people about what they're experiencing, what they have experienced and also just to ask them what their priorities are in terms of recovery. So we've met with quite a few of the social sector, so the kind of  a lot of the service providers in Te Aumaru and Cambridge as well and we're just sort of collecting up things in terms of what's sort of happening on the ground for people so quite a bit of that is indicating that there are still redundancies to come so we're expecting that the worst hasn't hit us yet so that's just something that we need to continue to monitor ongoing  I think another common theme that has come through from those meetings is that there is some real concern about how we will meet the needs in our communities, that our social services are stretched already, some concern about the lack of philanthropic funding, given that the gaming trusts are not going to be operational for a while, they haven't been collecting any income during lockdown, so that will probably have quite a significant impact.  especially on our non-governmental organisation sort of sector, our charitable kind of sector. A lot of talk about building resilience and self-sustainability and wanting to help people to get out of the situation and then not be put back into a similar vulnerable situation again. So things like community gardens,  teaching people even how to cook, how to sew, financial literacy, so how to work on a low income. All of that have been kind of recurrent things which people have discussed. So the response to COVID-19 has been a civil defence response, so the welfare  has been led through our organisation and led by our civil defence team. But pretty early on, central government indicated that recovery probably wouldn't be led by civil defence. And that's because this isn't the kind of usual civil defence emergency that you would typically see. So in most civil defence emergencies, it's a short, sharp hit. It's over pretty quickly and then you transition onto recovery.  Whereas with COVID-19, we had a very long rolling response and the impacts of that are still going to be felt probably for many months to come. It's significantly more complex than a standard civil defence emergency. So central government have indicated that they think the best approach to leading recovery is through the standard ministerial offices.  So the current thinking is, or the language that they are using, is locally led, centrally enabled, which means that local government has always had responsibility for leading recovery in local communities, but they are indicating that they are really expecting local government to collaborate with one another, but also really work with our local communities to  assist the community to recover from this. So as an organisation we've set up an internal project group and we've set some initial strategic priorities and those are based on the information that we have collected from communities and from the data that we've had to date. We will continue to refine those priorities as more information becomes available and  You'll see from my report that staff are proposing that we create two new roles and those roles will really be to work on the ground out in communities to assist with recovery activities. So we're saying that those people would be quite hands on. This obviously is going to go  needs to be approved by council the week after next. So it hasn't been formally approved yet, but that's sort of one of our proposed approaches. And I'm thinking that we need to take a reasonably flexible and agile approach to this, given that we don't know yet just exactly how this is going to pan out. Yeah, but I'm happy to take any questions. Greg Morgan Thanks, Debbie.",

They connected in eventually into our civil defense welfare response, and that's been ongoing. I guess it's going to be the transition as we transition from that civil defense lead into the, what they call it, they're calling it caring for communities, which is led by central government. So I guess that's where we just need to keep an eye on things and make sure that people don't slip through the cracks on that one.",

So there's all those formal things that were carried out by the iwi authorities working all together, that's Waikato Tainui, the Maniapoto M\u0101ori Trust Board and Raukawa Settlement Trust, as I believe, and even extending down to T\u016bwharetoa. So collaborative work.  and also noting too that whilst there was the formal response, it was a wide range of informal responses from iwi members doing what we know to be the right thing to do by taking care of each other, where we had no contact drop-offs of food parcels from within families. Everything from crayfish  watercress, you know, the things that raise a smile. I don't know about your wh\u0101nau, but mine topped off some very tasty crayfish and other things.  I'll say. Magnificent, and the approach is continuing. I think one of the lessons raised by the iwi authorities is that they learnt a lot from the period of the earthquakes in Christchurch and how iwi from across the North Island moved to support  kaitahu in its circumstances there. That meant really mobilising the people, mobilising resources, planning, etc. And so those lessons learned there were recommitted to a new event.",

Started off with only about 35 wh\u0101nau and kaum\u0101tua. We looked at kaum\u0101tua and households with a lot of children in them. The weekend just gone, on Saturday we delivered 80. And that was across through the South Waikato over to Tauranga.  And that was mainly to our wh\u0101nau. We actually have been able to capture a lot of data because wh\u0101nau are actually getting in touch with us via a form, a p\u0101neu that gets sent out. So there's been a lot of data. I'm looking forward to being able to share that with you because now we're in the recovery stage that we're looking at. Yes, we're doing a market garden at Maungatautari School where everyone can come in  and do that. But the other thing that we're also doing is pulling our kaum\u0101tua together to be a part of that market garden, tamariki. So we've gone into that sort of stage of looking at holding, breaking the social isolation. But I just wanted to share with you guys that we found that the kaum\u0101tua were actually very resilient throughout all of this. Most of them knew how to cook, they knew how to preserve, they were  happy with the isolation and solitude, what we found, what we have found actually is that it is the young families with young parents, the age group is like in their 30s, who didn't realize that they couldn't cook from scratch, that they do need packaged stuff from the supermarket. So that's one of the courses that we're going to be running is preserving and making flour.  for that age group too. I think there was a bit of a shock for them that they didn't know all those skills. But our kaum\u0101tua were very resilient and oftentimes were saying, give it to the young ones. So our recovery part of it is that we're probably going to continue to give out KiPaks for the next five weeks at least.  So I'm looking forward to meeting you guys next week.",

And we're at the stage, we're employing over 30 people at the moment. And it's increasing. And any recovery, we need to be involved in because we have an impact on all our rangatahi that were committed to a  decent, better life, I guess. And anything that affects this region, I think we need to be integral in that discussion. And that's because we are responsible for the generations of the future. And so we've made a concerted effort to ensure that those generations of the future have an environment which they can blossom and go in. And we've created that on our marae.  but not only on our marae, in other marae around us and in the other industries around us. So that's my interest in the recovery process. What we don't want to happen is see them end up on the scrap heap along with all the other marae that are going to lose their jobs over the next 12 months or 24 months. And we'll be really interested in having  an integral part of this discussion, this discussion going forward. I just wanted to raise that to get it on the table.",

I've been caught up with a few other things. So I think since we  Last updated to this committee, we've workshopped the draft of the naming policy with councillors and we've taken their comments on board, all their positive comments about the way forward. Everyone seems to be happy with the general process of trying to select names for roads and parks and reserves and so on.  Councillors have also asked that it's in the policy that council themselves sign off on the final choice of names rather than it being a delegated staff. We're also acknowledging as part of the process that the community boards have not actually been in a position to add value to the naming process, but so we've  got hopefully a slimmed down process now of discussion between council, tangata whenua, people putting forward ideas. The criteria for keeping names local  Um, that seems to be happy. Um, or everyone seems to be happy with that. Um, we've circulated to members of, uh, now we talk and we've received a positive and helpful feedback, uh, from them. And a few weeks ago, we had a long discussion with, uh, no, we talk and we've made some further amendments again.  mostly just wording changes, making sure that things are phrased correctly and that we've got everything covered. The one thing we've still not settled on is the name of the naming policy, which  still amuses me, but there was discussion over whether we should have a dual name and where that's resting at the moment is probably, we simply call it the naming policy and we have the equivalent of that in te reo Maori. So where we're up to now is probably happy  or probably getting in a position now where we can start thinking about bringing this back into the council chamber and seeking the green light for some consultation on this. But I'm happy to receive any further comments and answer any questions that you might have. Thank you.",

    "text": " Look, this was a project that was started before my time at Council. I started a year ago. This started back in 2015 when Council, following the Ng\u0101ti Koriki-Kahakura settlement, initiated the review and so they followed the Reserves Act process of doing that first step where you say we're going to review the plan and you seek initial submissions on that  there was a bit of a gap because of resourcing and capacity and then we've picked it up and worked with Becca from last year and with the reference group which was made up of Poto Davies, Linda Te Aho and Thelma Reti and took those submissions into consideration to develop the draft plan and  This is what was gifted to us from the reference group and is included in the plan here so I'll let you read that.  So in preparing it, we spoke to a number of stakeholders, obviously the mana whenua, the regional council, the Department of Conservation, and we went to the Maungatautari Reserve Committee several times with the draft plan. I thought it'd just be useful just to, most of you will know the maunga well, but just to indicate with these couple of maps,  Just the area. So in here, the map shows and read the pest proof fence. The southern and northern enclosure and the tracks across the maunga. The management plan itself actually only covers the scenic reserve land. So that's about three quarters of the land that's included within the pest proof fence.  And the management plan is an important document to guide all those other plans that will govern the day-to-day management of the maunga. So it's influenced by a number of pieces of legislation and strategies and policies, including the iwi environment plans. And then as I said, it influences a number of other plans. The vision  was worked through and largely drafted and put forward by the reference group, and I think it's fantastic. I think that if we look at the big changes from the current management plan, which was adopted in 2005, to this draft management plan, which we're out for consultation on at the moment, is we've got, tried to make it a document that really speaks to the  the significance of the maunga to mana whenua, but to all of us, the fact that it is this taonga toko iho and to try and really convey some of those messages to get the hearts and minds of people to understand the importance of the maunga and therefore also, I guess, hopefully then understand the rationale for the policies and the framework that guides the day-to-day management of the maunga.  This is a new part that the old management plan didn't have. We've got principles that are to guide all decisions in relation to the maunga and they were developed obviously in partnership with the reference group and include things like wairuatanga, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, mahi nga tahi. So I think principles that will speak to everyone.  The management plan then goes into having a number of sections covering off the objectives and policies. And some of those are quite similar to what's in the existing management plan. But I think there is a real focus on the partnership component with mana whenua, with volunteers, with other stakeholders.  is probably one of the things that's really come through in this plan. So the plan we released last Monday for public consultation, under the Reserves Act, you're required to have a two-month period. We've extended that to 10 weeks to take into account the impacts of COVID and give people more time.  We have put public notices into all the local newspapers, doing quite a strong push through social media. We've sent letters out to adjoining landowners, mana whenua, key stakeholders, and have made the plans available at the libraries and council offices. There's an online survey form which we're encouraging people to provide their submission through.  but we're also very happy to receive written submissions either by way of email or hand delivery or by post. The submission period closes 31st of July and following that we'll obviously be analysing the submissions, preparing a hearings report and having a hearings probably in early September.  At SPMP, we sought a resolution to appoint two independent hearing commissioners to hear and recommend back to council. So those independent commissioners haven't been found yet. I still need to do that piece of work. But we set out that there was a mix of skills that we would be looking for when selecting those commissioners. And one of those, obviously, is a really strong understanding of te ao M\u0101ori.  So following that, there will be then the process of reporting to council to adopt the plan and then presenting the plan through to the minister for final approval. So that's a brief overview of the process we've followed, the plan, the fact it's out for consultation and we are hoping to get a large number of submissions and to hear from everyone about what they think about the plan. I'm very happy to answer any questions.",

    "text": " So kia ora tatou. So some time ago, a paper was pulled together and put to Council in respect of an orthographic writing convention for te reo M\u0101ori as a standard way of writing te reo M\u0101ori within Council. And that arose out of observing the way in which Council staff, et cetera, try to  Right and Te Reo M\u0101ori were in different places. And basically, we missed the mark somewhat. So this is an effort in professionalism and raising the bar, and also in some small way, a contribution towards our Treaty partners in respect of Te Reo. So in discussions held at the Council table, there were questions around the  various, as I believe, various writing orthographics for Te Reo M\u0101ori as they stand now, with a special consideration for the Cambridge area in which I believe some of the schools there have been writing with the double vowel, etc. And there, of course, when you go into Waikato itself, within Hamilton, etc., you'll see the prolification of the double vowel as opposed to  the macro. Now, I was asked to speak to Waikato, Waikato Tainui, but also took the opportunity to revisit and have broader conversations with other, with other iwi authorities and runanga, etc. And so we've covered off a wide base of iwi  Some discussions are yet to still happen, but generally this is the trend that we've found is that everyone spoken to thus far agrees that the council should adopt a standard. And everyone agrees that that standard is the standard proposed or sorry, created and used by the government and others.  which is the M\u0101ori Language Commission standard by Te Taura Whiri Te Reo M\u0101ori. Now the standard isn't just about macros. It also sets out how names should be written in respect of the length of names, whether or not they should be divided by or separated, individual words separated by hyphens, etc. So there's a range of guidance  uh matters there within the orthographic great stuff um and the orthographic is is there in english and in maori and it's online it's easy to digest takes a little while for some people to get their minds around it the hardest part is being able to load it up into your computer making sure that you've got macrons at hand and then just becoming familiar with that but again i've spoken with um  with representatives or, well, certainly m\u0101tanga or knowledge experts from around the place. So that is the likes of Taumaroa, Paraone Gloyne, spoke also with Harry Midwood. Who else have we spoken with? A range of people. Aunty Rovina has spoken with  R\u0101hui Papa, and R\u0101hui, to his credit, also stated that the way forward is with the provision by Te Taura Whiri Te Reo M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori Language Commission. Interesting enough for him, it was a matter of whakapapa, that the government, central government, created or enabled the M\u0101ori Language Commission, and therefore,  It only makes sense that the uri or the local councils, which are seen in the whakapapa as the children of central government, that what's good for the government, what's good for the parent is also good for the children. So it's very clear about that as well, which was a very M\u0101ori way of looking at it. And also,  It was very much in favour of the m\u0101kara, which was news. I was expecting it would go with the double vowel. But in saying so, noting too that each of the iwi will have a particular way in which they spell their names, etc., and those things will remain. And that type of guidance is still there in the  the measures or the orthographic provided by Te Taura Whiri Te Reo M\u0101ori. I also spoke yesterday at length with Tania Apa, R\u0101hui's sister, who was the designer, if you like, of the writing orthographic for Waikato-Tainui and have received yesterday her report to the same.  and noting too that whilst Waikato-Tainui within that report and the recommendation is that they continue to use the double vowel, they also use the macron. Both are allowed for certainly in their internal documents and signage etc. Waikato tend to use the double vowel but they also noted in the document and its recommendations  which are the standard now for Waikato-Tainui, that should signage, etc. not allow for the length of a name because of the double vowel, then they revert back to the macron. But then as individuals within Waikato-Tainui, each is allowed to do what they like. But, and there is a but, it is either the double vowel or the macron.  but not both within the same document. So interesting stuff. But your worship and to those seated around the various tables and desks in our backyard, it's very apparent that to all those spoken to within Waikato, Maniapoto, Raukawa and Matanga and certainly the recommendation for Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u014d Waip\u0101 at the last meeting,  have very much supported for the use of the Macron and the Tauruwhiri Te Reo M\u0101ori writing orthographic, that that's the way to go.",

    "text": " Yes, thank you for that and I apologise I should really have brought this up at our Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b o Waip\u0101 meeting, Shane but I obviously wasn't onto it and listening to your report a second time some things strike me and the fact is of course that we're dealing with a lot of marae in the area where  the long sound is or may not be pronounced. And we strive towards giving correct pronunciation of names. And one that I can think of besides my own is Parawera. Is it Parawera or is it Parawera? Or is it Parawera? And it makes a big difference as to whether you pronounce the name long or short as to  the meaning of the name because that name and its meaning has a history and you may get that history wrong if you give it an incorrect pronunciation. So, Pirikiriki, even though, okay, so the marae itself is situated out of area. Many of our members are within Waipa area, hence  Anyhow, we have had this debate with our own name being one of those. Is it P\u016b Rikiriki or P\u016b Rikiriki? And is it a long sound or not? Well, it is, of course, a long sound. Otherwise, the meaning, the lack of the long sound detracts from the meaning of the name and the origin of the name, which comes from the saying of King T\u0101whiao. So it should be there.  in its pronunciation. However, we've debated this because we have some strong advocates for use of the macron, including my own nephew, Te Taka Keegan, who was a staunch advocate of its use for te reo M\u0101ori.  we've gone back to some of the writings of our kaum\u0101tua, how did they write it in their time, and we've struck the same, what we've struck is some have written two u's, the letter u, and some have not. But the pronunciation has never varied. It's always been p\u016brekireki, it's not p\u016brekireki or something like that. So I support  the standardization of the use of and with the use of the macron because it does facilitate correct pronunciation for people who are new to te reo M\u0101ori and its pronunciation so in that respect it's helpful but I just wanted to introduce the fact that it  can be debated, is still debated, as Shane has indicated, within our own circles. And we then discuss the reason for it. And I was brought up with learning te reo M\u0101ori, not at home, but in an institutional situation where the double vowel, I'm just coming down from  learning under Bruce Biggs and others involved in that time. And that's how I learned to write it. But I very easily changed over to the use of the Macrom, especially when writing with a typewriter and computer. There's no difficulty there, but it's the aid to the pronunciation  correct pronunciation of the name that I think is the most important and therefore if the Macron can indicate that then it has value in its usage and I think it's in our own benefit to agree with and to support the standardization with the use of the Macron.  Here we go.",

Te K\u014dpua is another one, always, it's never been written with a double O, for our lot it's never been written with a macron, it was just Te K\u014dpua, but it's actually Te K\u014dpua. And so the introduction in the macron reaffirms to us  the meaning. And likewise the name of our tupuna, which appears often without a macron, but it's incorrectly pronounced as Hine Marama, the moon maiden, when in actual fact it's Hine Marama. And that name Hine Marama, translated by uncle, the late Sonny Paweo Emery, as delightful lady.  Now for those of you involved in horses and races, you know that name. The point being is that there will be names written by Ng\u0101ti Koro ki Kahukura, one of those, and they will be looking to get a list of names and the way they want their names written, as opposed to how we might do. Because this is all part and parcel of the  of the orthographic is that we can't change names as we might wish them to appear according to the orthographic, because if they're a title of an organization, that is the legal name. If the iwi write it in a particular way, and we're speaking about them to them, then we write it in their way. But as a standard right across the board going forward, if this is supported, then the Macron will  will indicate in the major parts of our writings. A place where this is naturally applied will be in things like signage. As we go forward within the district, we may see bilingual signage. We also may see within the museums and the like, libraries where te reo M\u0101ori requires a standard so that  or those that are attached to the council. But anyway, it's all good stuff. It'll be for some would be like changing from the old system to a metric system. Yes.",

I haven't appeared before this committee before, but I'm relatively new on the  policy planning team, and we deal specifically with the district plan. So my understanding is that you've had some, something to do with the district plan in the past when we were, the council was reviewing it, but since then there hasn't been a lot of things going on. And so we wanted to come back to you and let you know what we're doing in the district plan area. So,  The first thing is that we've got quite a lot going on now. We've got about five different work streams in the district plan, and one of them are plan changes, which are promoted by the council. Some of them are private plan changes, so that means that members of the public can promote a plan change themselves, which they pay for,  ultimately can change the district plan to suit what their development requirements are. We've got three that we are working on at the moment internally, in-house, and Hayley and I are going to tell you a bit more of those in a minute. So next slide, Sam, please.  So the district plan itself, we're not sure how familiar you are with it, but it contains policy guidance and rules for development and subdivision, but it also seeks to protect important buildings, landscapes, and natural areas. So it's been a few years since the plan had a thorough review, and it became operative in August 2017. So under the RMA, we are required to review the plan every 10 years,  But obviously, in between those 10 years, there are things that come up that make you think it's not working quite as well as we'd like it to, or it's not particularly effective. We'd like to make some changes. So that's why we're here today, to tell you about some of those changes that we've got planned, and as a starting point for our consultation that we need to do with iwi. Next please, Sam.  So there is a legal process set out under the Resource Management Act and it does include that we consult with iwi authorities and any plan changes must be publicly notified unless the change has been directed specifically from the government. We do have accredited commissioners to come and hear plan changes and some of them, so some of them might be our own councillors  and some of them might be independent commissioners, especially when there are areas of expertise that are required, say for tikanga, engineering or economics or something like that. Next please, Sam. So our plans change work stream as we have some do now changes. So the message from the government has been  let's enable development to occur post-COVID. And some of the ways that we can do that are to make some changes to the district plan that enable development to get a bit of a hurry up by not standing in their way. Some of them we need to do with a little, well, all of them with a lot of thought, but yeah, some are a higher priority than others.  We do have some do-next changes, oh sorry, the do-now changes we will talk to you about in a minute. The do-next changes are ones that have been approved by the Strategic Policy and Planning Committee to progress. It's just that we don't have enough staff to do that right now, but they're definitely on the list and will be the next plan changes to be done.  And then there are the private plan changes and they are led by developers, they're not council-led. Next please, Sam. So we've got seven do now plan changes and they are being led in-house by council. We've got the uplifting of deferred zone, which is a method in the plan to allow development on a larger scale for new subdivisions and growth cells. And Hayley will be talking to you soon about that.  We've got permeable surfaces, which is to do with stormwater management, generally on individual lots where people are wanting to build their homes or their garages, that sort of thing. There are some technical improvements that we'd like to make to the residential zone rules, especially where people are having to apply for consents because the rule is not worded correctly or makes it difficult for them to comply in a practical sense.  And then there are the others that we haven't started yet, but we'd like to come back to you as we make progress on them. And that's the C10 rezoning, which is the growth cell in Cambridge, the Hautapu structure plan area, beekeeping and residential zones, and the industrial zones in Cambridge. Next please, Sam. So the ones that we are looking at doing now, and that we've started doing some,  research on and moving forward with them. Oh sorry, these are the next ones that we want to come back to you at a later date. So we've got the infill subdivision and urban development. So you probably know that Waipa District is a really high growth area and it's been recognised by the government as that.  The government will be putting out, hopefully later this year, a national policy statement on urban development, which will help us work out which way our district plan needs to go in terms of moving forward with that. The ones of particular interest to this committee will be iwi sites of significance and papak\u0101inga,  So Maniapoto Trust Board came to us late last year wanting to update the sites of significance in the district plan. And that's because they, so the district plan does protect some sites of significance, but they hadn't all been ground-truthed as far as I understand. So they have a mapping exercise that they're doing where they've got a lot more information that they'd like to be included.  So we can hopefully extend that plan change research to other iwi authorities. And papak\u0101inga housing, there are different district plans around the country that use different models to enable papak\u0101inga to help to occur more easily. And we'd like to look into how some other councils are doing that so that that can be  enabled more easily in our district. And then there are two areas in Te Awamutu that the property department is looking at the moment to perhaps change them to residential zone if that's the more suitable zone. And when they come back to us, we'll be able to move forward on that. So next please, Sam. Yeah, there's a private plan changes that are probably coming our way.  One is, there's, sorry, I'm not too familiar with what these ones are, but there's the T2 growth cell in Te Awamutu, which I think is the proposed residential development and retirement village next to the water tower, the water reservoir, sorry, I can't remember the name of the road, next to the T1 cell at the-  That's it. Thank you. Thank you. So because it's a private plan change and a developer has a specific need to use that land, that's actually going to bring the growth cell forward ahead of the strategy timeframe that we've had in the past. Next please, Sam. Okay, so that's it for the basic background to the  plan change work program that we've got coming up over the next few years. If I could pass it over to Hayley Thomas now. She is our project planner working in the Cambridge office, and she has joined our team to help us with some of these plan changes that we've got going on. So over to you, Hayley.",

It talks about landscape and buildings and everything like that. For us, the sites of significance isn't a do next, it's a do now, if not have done already situation. So, I do wonder why there are  you know, other things are spelled out, the buildings and landscapes and everything. Sites of significance isn't spelled out in the overview. And why it comes up in the do next category. So that's my first question. I have a second question, and that relates to the permeable surfaces in the do now. And we've been discussing at Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b the disturbance of the whenua.  And we wondered how that fits into the permeable services part of the do now, because we are really keen to not have too much disturbance of the whenua and want to know what strategies are in place or being looked at. Happy to contribute in that area as well, but we would want to keep the disturbance of the whenua to the minimum.",

    "text": " I'm happy to answer those questions, Your Worship. Thanks, Tony. Maybe if I can answer the first one and I might defer to Julie for the permeable services second part of the question. So I'm not sure if you've got your agendas with you, but on page 29, there's a list of all the plan changes that are before us. So we call that plan change work stream. So we have 10 that we have to, I guess, manage in terms of resourcing and budget.  So yes, we understand that sites of significance in Papak\u0101inga will be of vital importance to the iwi and rangatira in this committee. However, as is the case for us of managing the resource that we have, and I guess the priorities that we've had to work through, that's the one, thank you. So we're under quite a bit of pressure to roll out some changes to the plan  to fix some things that are more broken than others, I suppose is the way you could put it. And the first lot of plan changes, which is what we're calling do now, are the ones which the SPMP committee and staff feel that are the ones that we need to prioritise first. And so that's the do now ones, the green and the blue there that you can see, that we prioritise and resource to do now with the resources and budgets available. It's not at all in any way minimising  the do next, which is the infill, the site significance and some other tidy up zone changes. So it's not a higher, it's a prioritization, but not a higher importance list if that makes sense. We want to make sure that we do the site significance properly as well, and that's going to take some time to work with the iwi partners. There'll be some consultation that we need to undertake around that. And  In order to do it properly, we feel that we need to get some of these other ones out of the way first, so we can give sufficient time to looking at the review of the sites of significance in Papak\u0101ina. So it's a long-winded answer, but it's really around prioritisation and resourcing and making sure that when we come to do that one, we've got the sufficient resources to do it right.",

The concern is, I suppose, massive construction earthworks going on in developing the sections prior to them getting built on, whereas the permeable surfaces controls relate to the coverage of the site once you start building your house, how much concrete paths you put down, how much percentage area the house covers on the site.  So, that's a sort of a stormwater management type issue at the time of building, as opposed to that major earthworks and disturbance that happens during the subdivisional development. So, not trying to put words in your mouth, but was the concern more those earthworks rather than the house construction time of the development?",

Is that just a generic interpretation that you're applying? I'm pushing the edge on this one deliberately because the term iwi authority is outdated. It was created way back in 1990 and it's still there.  And that was created for the want of anything else that was available at the time. Its use now, I think, is archaic, it's outdated, and the world has changed in the last 30 years, but this application is still there.

So that definition is straight out of the Resource Management Act. And the problem that creates for councils around the country is it is very generic. And of course, there are iwi in different regions and different districts that do have iwi authority status, but might not be covered by that definition.  So I guess the first point would be that whenever we do a plan change or a plan review, the lawyers always have a field day in making sure we get it right. So the safest place for us to start from is always come back to the words in the RMA and the definitions in the Resource Management Act. So I thought I'd put that out a little bit provocatively because I understood that there'd be wider  Iwi authority, as we understand it in the district, will be wider than what the Resource Management Act describes it as. So the way that we'll be approaching this, and we'd like your feedback on this too, but the way we think we would approach this in these plan changes and the plan review would be to take a pragmatic interpretation of that. So even though that's prescribed and defined in the Resource Management Act, we'd prefer to go back to members of the committee  and ask them which iwi authorities or which iwi should we be consulting and engaging with.

And I'll give you the reasons why.  Back pre-COVID-19, M\u0101ori, because of the Waikeria build, were determined to be prejudiced with respect to accessibility and affordability of housing. Now, this was tested in the Environment Court, and the Environment Court, with respect to the legislative requirement for Waikeria, agreed in principle.  As a result of that, Mani Pota Hapu of the Waiata district, specifically Mani Pota Te Taraki, sought relief or remedy from corrections with respect to that prejudice towards M\u0101ori access and affordability of housing. And we're fortunate enough to receive a seeding fund to assist us to address public haka within the district.  Now MPI has been working for the last few years with council around how we do that. One of the issues was that the lack of appropriateness of the current status of Papak\u0101ina within the district plan. And then we saw that as quite a significant detriment to our capacity to develop Papak\u0101ina housing within Waip\u0101.  And I think the classic example of that is the Korok\u012b Kahukura application, where they had to spend tens of thousands of dollars just to get it past the Resource Consent Scheme. So that's some of the background. What NKTR has found in its analysis of the current post-COVID-19  is that M\u0101ori are more vulnerable now than they were pre-COVID-19. And why is that? Because 90% of the jobs that are being lost in the industry are M\u0101ori. There's a basic problem, that's where all the cuts come from, and we are starting to see that emerge quite significantly within our community. We still have this  that we need to bring forward and start creating to assist Maori now more urgently than we thought earlier on. So COVID-19 has accentuated the lack of availability, the lack of accessibility to affordable accommodation and affordable housing.  With the assistance of that feeding fund, we had developed a plan which we knew could assist them. And I think that plan is now becoming more important than when we originally developed it. We're actually starting discussions with politicians around how can we take this process forward urgently in the post-COVID-19 era. And that started last week.  So what we would strongly recommend is that council moves Papak\u0101inga into the do now status. Because we don't want to get to the point where we've done all the planning, people are giving up their land. You don't have to worry about your areas of land that you're trying to create for housing. We have our own areas.  We want to be able to utilise those to assist our people to get into houses. And what that means for M\u0101ori is that they don't have to pay for the infrastructure or the land. They're only paying for their houses. And we can manage that in a really economical way. But the numbers we're looking at is probably 20 to 30 houses in the first two years.  I doubt very much of the Wi-Fi can actually do that for its subdivision areas under the post-COVID-19 environment. And that's because we all know that money has dried up and it'll dry up even more going forward. Our concern with M\u0101ori is that if we leave this too long and we don't have the resources or the process in place when we're ready to hit the ground, our money will dry up too.  So this is really urgent to assist the impact of COVID-19. I wanted to put that on the table so that you understand the predicament that we're in and how serious this is. Nothing you have in the do now has an effect on M\u0101ori, nothing whatsoever. These are not M\u0101ori things, but no focus on M\u0101ori whatsoever in your determination of the resource  focus for that area. And I'm putting on the table that here is something that is truly M\u0101ori that you must consider very, very seriously going forward from here. So that is Maniapoto's recommendation to this committee this week, that we move to Papak\u0101inga. And I think going on to what Bill was talking about, the  Waihitapu. I note in there that the initiative for that was a request from Maniapoto to add or change or do something about the Waihitapu project that we did five or six years ago. And they want to actually formalize that in the district plans. To be fair and to be clear,  That will only go at the pace that we decide is the hapu for this area that are going forward. So Bill is quite correct. It has to go through its Waikato District Council on the funeral process before it even gets to the point where Mani Puroa can actually put in those things that we've given them the history for to stick into that tonga register. So it's not a biggie. That is not a biggie.  But I think the biggie is the propaganda one. We must get that moving. And we'll be seeking, as I said, political assistance for us to be able to get that moving urgently, as early as next week. Thanks. Mr. Mayor, Mr. Chair.",

It made changes around for marae papak\u0101inga, but not one that was off, that was not on a marae, which is what Ng\u0101ti Koriki Kahukura did. So Puta and I talked about that, because that's what we missed when we talked about papak\u0101inga with the council. But I agree that we just need to revisit it again. So the Waikato District Council had done a lot of work.  had done a lot of work down there, around Papak\u0101inga, that went all the way down to K\u0101whia, around Raglan, and trying to encourage M\u0101ori to go into a Papak\u0101inga. But because of the council rules, we couldn't. Because most of our land is land that is multiple owned land.  But then Te Puni K\u014dkiri have now got a scheme out where M\u0101ori can do that. But in council, our issue around that is trying to build a papakainga that is currently within a town. And the definition of a papakainga inside of a town. Because there are a lot of M\u0101ori family who like to live in the same vicinity.  like a papakainga, eh?

So the product plan change is only specific to the area that they'll be applying for and what it will seek to do, so it's already zoned residential, it will seek to uplift that zoning and introduce rest home development and some residential development. But what it won't do is it won't look at any other consents that have been granted already because it is quite site specific.

    "text": "OK, so I'm just getting my screen set up so I can see what I'm talking to.  So the first one that I'm just going to talk you through is our proposed plan change 13. Now this gets quite technical, so I will try and simplify things as much as I can so you can follow what I'm saying. So if I step back a little bit from the information that you can see, and that's in the report, what we have in our district plan is areas that we've zoned deferred zones. So these zones show  The areas that we've identified through our growth strategy that we want to take from rural zone to some sort of residential or large lot zone or an industrial or commercial zone. So the areas that we've been out, we've talked to the community, it's come through that growth strategy process. And our way of showing them in the district plan is to show them as deferred zones.  Now that we've got them in our district plan so you can see where they are, there is some more steps that people have to take to then subdivide and develop on that land. So they first have to get what we call a structure plan approved, and that's a very high-level plan that sets out where the roads and infrastructure goes, if there's going to be just all residential zone or if there's going to be a block of commercial somewhere in the mix, that kind of thing.  So they go through the structure plan process, which is a resource consent process, which we come through, and I often see those, and I think I've seen a couple of you at those meetings to talk through some of those structure plan applications. Once they've got consent for that structure plan, the next step is to uplift the deferred zone. So this is where we take a resolution to the council and say, please, can we  we take it from deferred zone and call it its live zone. So most of our growth cells are going into residential zones, but there are some that we uplift that go into commercial or industrial zones. After that second step, then the developers are required to lodge the subdivision consents, and that's when the real detailed design comes through in that subdivision. So that's how the current plan works for this process. Recently,  Council have become aware of some case law about best practice for how these processes should work. And as a result of that case law, we need to just make some slight tweaks to our district plan to make sure we're still doing the best practice process to enable development of these areas. Next slide, please, Anne. And so what we've done here is  and to try and create our best practice process, I've come up with some options of what we could do. So they're very technical, and all the detail is in your report in front of you. But very simply, we have the options of doing nothing. So that's basically keeping the status quo. I don't think our lawyers will like this option, so we do need to  Although it's an option, it's probably not what we call a realistic option to consider. An option that we could use is something called incorporation by reference. So the Resource Management Act has a very big schedule at the back, which tells you all this very technical information. But very simply, there's a clause in there that allows you to reference a document in your district plan.  and we could use that process as an option to include structure plan in the district plan. It would mean that we basically end up with a list that sits separate from the district plan, and that list would tell people when zones were live or not. A third option we have is just to be quite bold and just take all the deferred zones out completely. This would be probably one of the more extreme  options, but there are a lot of district plans around that don't use a deferred zone as an option. So what those district plans do instead is they basically show the areas as like a rural zone. And if you wanted to develop in that space, you would have to go through a full plan change process, which can be quite time consuming and cost consuming.  The fourth option, option four, is to uplift the deferred zones in our pre-2035 growth cells. So these are the cells that we've identified through our growth strategy as needing to go before 2035 to meet our requirements under some of the government legislation about providing for growth. So this would enable those  areas to just go straight to that third step I talked about earlier and just lodge those subdivision consents. Option five is a little bit different. It's an idea I had that we would basically keep doing the process that we have been doing, but once a year or every two years, council would do a little mock-up plan change to basically tidy up any areas that have been already through those consent processes.  This option means a regular commitment from council, but the positive I could see with this option is that everyone, if you made it a regular timing, everyone would know and be able to work to that timing, which I could see being quite beneficial for some developers. If they know it's coming, they can get the A into G and make sure that they've got all their consents sorted before we do our mop-up plan change to make the district plan reflect the zone that they need.  And the last option there, option six, is we could remove the process that we have in our district plan for getting a structured plan approved via resource consent. So again, this is a process that a lot of other councils don't use, but we identified through the district plan review as an enabling sort of process, but it is one we could look at taking out to make things a bit simpler, and this would  mean that if people wanted to proceed with a structure plan, they would have to go back to that schedule one resource management process of doing a full plan change, which, like I said earlier, can be time consuming and cost consuming. So that's my very brief summary of those options. I'm happy to take questions because it's obviously very technical, and I apologize if I've used way too much planning jargon, as I know planners like to.  So no questions are dumb questions, so happy to take any.",

    "text": "OK, so good question that there are three major changes coming to the Resource Management Act. So one at the moment, the government's pushing through under urgency, and that's to fast track infrastructure developments through the consenting process.  There's a bill currently before Parliament. I don't think it's out yet for consultation. I don't think it's had its first reading yet. So that's being pushed through quite fast as part of COVID recovery. And so the only thing I can advise there is keep an eye on Parliament website. And I imagine when that comes out, there'll be a very short turnaround for any submissions on that as a bill. So that's the first one. The second one at the moment before Parliament is a bill which is soon to come in and be enacted.  And that's what they call RMA reform phase one. So it repeals some earlier changes that the previous government made, mainly around resource consenting processes. So the impact there is really process impact. It sets up a new water hearing commission nationally.  And that's in response to the Regional Council Management of Water Resources. I'm not familiar with enough, I guess, with that process to understand what the opportunities might be for M\u0101ori to participate. But I do know that they're looking at a national pool of hearing commissioners to hear all water plan changes effectively. That's a new process that will be set up.  And that will be of high interest to this committee and to iwi. The third piece of legislation they're looking at is the overhaul of the Resource Management Act. So there's a paper that's being put out on that. There's a technical advisory group that is meeting and considering now, and the ministry officials have said that they expect them to be reporting back July, August.  So that will be from the technical advisory group on whether the RMA, as we know it at the moment, is still the best model to use or whether it should look differently. It'll be quite a big process to go through for that and I imagine that the iwi leaders group will have a very high interest in participating in that and certainly at our level  there'll be opportunities throughout that process to look at that, but we don't know what those changes will be yet.",

    "text": "Thank you, Hayley and thank you, Sam. Thank you, Mayor Jim. I'm back again to talk about permeable surfaces and like Hayley, this is again quite technical, but it's just an introduction to you to let you know  what is coming up, the kind of work that we're doing, and to progress it further by undertaking more consultation, hopefully within the next couple of weeks, sending out letters to our iwi partners and stakeholders. So permeable services, especially in the residential zone, relate to, there are lots of rules and policies and definitions about permeable and impermeable services, and that's to do with  houses and decks and patios and things on individual lots that are being built. And when they cover too much of an area, they can create problems with disposing of stormwater. So we do have some rules in the plan that manage that in order that we don't have sort of surface flooding in that in particular areas. So particularly in Cambridge North, that is an area that has a higher  threshold requirement for not so much of a site to be covered because they have difficult soils there to dispose of rainwater. And so that's one of the main problems with some of these rules. So some of the definitions and the rules do cause some confusion because they don't quite match up. And so our consent plan is often having to  find a practical solution to questions that they get over the counter and over the phone and when resource consents come in. It makes it hard to administer for them and because sometimes they're not very clear. Next please Sam. So we have commenced having a look at some of these rules and  Like Hayley, we've got a couple of options, and I'll just run through them really briefly. So one is the status quo, and that would mean leaving everything as it is, everybody having to apply for a consent, especially in Cambridge North, because very few houses there meet the requirements or the permitted standard in the district plan. So they always have to apply for a resource consent.  So it's not ideal because it makes it very hard for the plan to administer if we just leave it the same as it is. So we could look at changing the definitions, which would tidy things up. And some of the rules are a bit poorly worded and could be changed. So that's one that could sort of easily be achieved. Another option is to change the threshold within the performance standards for the permitted activity.  So in most of the residential zone in the district, you need 40% of the site to have permeable surfaces, as in gardens, lawns, that sort of thing. In the Cambridge North area, they're required to have 55%, which is significantly higher. So what we would like to do is get an engineer to review the original data as to why we came up with that.  threshold in the first place, and to see if it's still relevant, bearing in mind that Cambridge North has reasonably developed already, and it may be that it's not necessary to change it, there's not enough evidence to change it. And another way to change things is to change the activity status. So at the moment, in Cambridge North, if somebody is over the 55%,  as in their house is too big for the site or they want to put in a swimming pool or a patio and it makes it over the 55, they need to apply for a discretionary resource consent. So that's quite a high bar to get over and it's a reasonably expensive exercise because they have to, not only do they have to get an engineer to design their stormwater disposal, they then have to apply for a consent to council, which is,  a deposit of a couple of thousand dollars. If we change the activity status, as in made it not so difficult to pass, we could potentially keep giving them their resource consents, but it wouldn't cost the individual home builder as much money. So that's something else that we need to look into in terms of the finance team will probably give us some assistance as to how much does it actually cost  How much does that add to the whole building project? Could we do it a different way? Next please, Sam. Does anybody have any questions about permeable surfaces before we move on to the next plan change?",

And when it rains, if the water can't permeate or saturate through the soil and dispose of itself by natural means, as in just going into the groundwater and then out to a stream and out to the river, if the site is covered by too many hard surfaces, then the water  can't dispose of itself on the property and it can cause problems either out on the road or on neighbours' properties. So the engineers came up with a level at which you could build a house and as long as it didn't cover too much of the site, it wouldn't cause those surface flooding problems because enough of the rainwater would be disposed of adequately in a natural way.

Some of it is about water for firefighting purposes in the rural zone. And some of it is about dust, smoke and odour rules, which are regional rules, not district rules. And so we're looking for a way to address nuisance factors  but not necessarily have rules on our plan because the RMA doesn't really allow us to do that. So, but just a bit of, I would just call it tidying up of some rules that are causing a few problems for the planners to implement and problems for people out there who are just wanting to build a garage, but they end up having to put a window in it, that sort of thing.

    "text": " T\u0113n\u0101 koutou, koutou, koutou. Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon, Your Worship and iwi, consultative committee members. Hopefully you can hear me all right. I don't have my earphones on here today. This is just an update on the civil defence COVID-19 Western Waikato emergency response. So a national state of emergency was declared on the 25th of March 2020, a response to the COVID-19  emergency event. So that was to support the activities of the health sector, particularly the Ministry of Health, the District Health Board. So the Western Waikato Emergency Operations Centre, the EOC, that was established in the Waipara District Council offices in Te Amutu. Now that was an EOC that was part of four EOCs that were established in the Waikato area and supported by the group, the GECC, at the Hamilton office.  The Western Waikato EOC that represented Waipa, Waitrohola and Waitomo on their shared service arrangements. I thought that went really, really well. The EOC consisted of staff from all three councils. Its primary purpose was to provide for the non-health needs of the communities within the Waipa, Waitrohola and Waitomo districts. So in the report, we've identified the key priorities of the EOC.  But in particular, the priority was about really, in practical terms, coordinating and enabling the social and welfare services across our communities. So including establishing and operating the CDM 0800 number to manage a significant surge in the requests that our normal social services couldn't handle. We were directly involved with the provision of household goods and services, temporary accommodation,  food assistance to individuals, families, and wh\u0101nau. So those were the principal activities that the CDM group were involved with. The other priorities are identified there in section three of the report. So I talked a little bit about public information management. We issued almost daily media releases reminding the community of the R800 number, the food banks, just reinforcing that the messages of the various levels of government  requirements at the time. There's a section there about the vulnerable groups. So an important part of the local response was supporting the welfare of most of the vulnerable people in our communities. And that was represented from several iwi groups within our three districts. We're very instrumental in reaching out and coordinating assistance for the people that needed our support the most.  I think it would be fair to say that we were a bit slow off the mark initially with our EOC to get the established iwi connections by our various groups. But once with the work particularly of Shane Taruku to assist in getting the right representatives inputting into the EOC and there are a number that came through and inputted into  the OCs versus Zoom briefings that we had in the morning and afternoon. And once we could understand and they could understand what was going on on a daily basis, I think the response in terms of the area was far greater. So that was just, I guess, an evolving situation. And I think in the end, it was working very well.  We identified the key people there from the various trust boards. The food banks there, so just going through the further on the report. So as I say, some of the key things was establishing the close relationship with the local food banks, the various marae as well. There was a tremendous number of food parcels that was distributed throughout our region. We identified there that the various food  banks, the marae, particularly the Maniapoto Marae Trust Board where Mekatu Marae was involved as a distribution centre for eight marae. And I think that worked really reasonably well. And it wasn't just food that was going out to them, there was firewood, blankets, all the other important things associated with the welfare needs of our communities. We also helped and supported the Waikato Tainui  Kaipak distribution centers in both Te Kiki and Cambridge. So we supported with a list of logistical support and security associated with that. And I think that was a very tremendous success as well. The report identifies the various volunteers that were involved. So not only in relation to operating the food banks, but also in relation to, let's say things like the community health shuttle services that we were providing.  We had three shuttles running in Te Amadu, Cambridge and Te Kauwhiti to help the most vulnerable people in our communities get the various medical assistance or whatever welfare requirements they needed at the time. So I think our welfare committees work pretty well in our towns. So just in the summary, collaboration between the Western Waikato EEOC,  the direct input of our Iwi connections into the EOC through the Zoom meetings, making sure that we delivered the wealthier requirements as we needed to our most vulnerable communities worked really well. So tremendous thanks to our volunteers that helped the EOC. I think the relationships as we move forward are going to be much stronger, particularly  particularly with the iwi's connections there, that we have key people that we can go to with future EOC emergencies. The de-escalation has occurred through the various levels. So the Western Waikato EOC was disestablished on the 14th of May, and essentially four EOCs became to two EOCs. There's a Northern EOC, which represented pretty much Waikato District, Hamilton,  and the Southern EOC, which was our area representing our Western Waikato councils, Taupo and South Waikato. Now it's based in Taupo district, coordinated by Dave Symes, who was our EOC, sorry, local controller. So that Southern EOC is now just also being disestablished yesterday, 2nd of June. So with the rejection and the 800 number calls that are coming through,  the services will go back to MSD. But importantly, for ongoing support, for those that want to remain as food bank providers, we'll be getting some more information now from the Civil Defence Group to our key people, including our iwi liaison, about applications to MSD which have to be in by the 8th of June to carry on as a food bank provider and ongoing support by MSD in that area.  We will be seeking to recover our costs for the welfare requirements through government, so we're just working through that process now, not anticipating any difficulties because all of our costs essentially have been for welfare requirements for our communities and people. So that's it, Your Worship and the committee. That's essentially the update at the moment. As I say, it's still an ongoing  a matter for support through our group, but it is, we are transitioning out from, in terms of emergency management, transitioning out of the response and moving more into a recovery phase associated with the COVID-19 requirements. So we worship the reporters that the recommendation, the report be received. That's it for me.",
