We are pushing, I think more and more, we're pushing applicants to talk to mana whenua first. I think we accept there's no reason why mana whenua should be out of pocket for doing that. So we're just looking at a couple of things, how we can notify  applicants ahead of time that they may need to. That you know that they'll potentially need to pay for that those services, but also working with Ng\u0101ui T\u014dp\u016b around, I guess, provision of greater administrative resource to allow them to process those requests in a timely way. So that's a piece of ongoing work that Gaylene and I have been having discussion about.  Okay, so, Gaylene, obviously, it's probably easier for Council to notify the applicants so that it's not a surprise for them when they get a bill, and they obviously need to be picking up the costs they do for all of the Council services.",

And I understand we do it by email, we can do it by mail. And I was wondering if council has any plans in the pipeline to move that into  an online space, maybe a portal where forms are submitted that way. The reason why I'm asking is I don't want to reinvent the wheel and look at how we set up some internal systems of how we monitor and track them. If there's something in the pipeline that council is going to do that way, all people would submit and be able to make comments to a form. Does anybody have any comment on that?",

So the scope's been determined to be the cemeteries that are owned and administered by the council. So that's, as you said, there's 10 public cemeteries across the district. And what we are keen to do at this early stage is understand from mana whenua how you would like us to engage with you on this project. We know that obviously,  while there's urup\u0101, the cemeteries are important to mana whenua m\u0101tauaka in terms of places where wh\u0101nau are buried, but also potentially in terms of important sites, sites of significance. So we're really keen to ensure that we are engaging the way you would like us to engage on that project. We've got a plan that looks in June to go out to the public with an online survey to get initial thoughts  I will then enter into, and we're doing some engagement with the RSA, Grey Power, other groups, and then we will look into drafting those plans and then taking those to community board, back to Ng\u0101ui T\u016bp\u016b towards the end of the year, and then up to service delivery early next year for endorsement to then go out for another round of engagement on their draft plans themselves. So, I think there's real potential at the moment when we look at our network.  There's been an attempt to ensure there's things like water provision for tikanga, important tikanga, but in terms of any other sort of cultural infrastructure, there's nothing. So there's a lot of opportunity through design, through signage, through perhaps mahi toi, through planting to make these spaces more welcoming in terms of for iwi and hap\u016b. But I think also,  Just the basic visitor. Some of the other things we've identified is there's a lack of shade and seating and other things that are really important to ensure that they are places where people can go and spend time comfortably.

And is that, first question, is that actually one of Waipaea District Council's responsibilities? Because I recall when we had to address that,  Everyone denied any ownership, any responsibility for it, and it defaulted to the Conservation Board, under the auspices of the Conservation Board. But I think its location in the local community sort of kept it within the WIPA discussion anyway. It never even got to the Conservation Board to be discussed at all. It was just one of those default things.  So that's the first thing, where does that fit in this list? Because we have a strong interest in that Ulupa and how it's managed. Because it was on land that was taken from our people under the Public Works Act and never returned.  And the other one is, we're talking about playgrounds, is Mangas Reserve, which is in Urupa. It is the cemetery. It has a playground on it that belongs to Waipaea District Council. So we have to have a wider context of thinking when we think about, do we have playgrounds on Urupa?  or other things on Urupa. That's a discussion, I think, that should be part of that discussion we have with Waipa, when we have that discussion, and now we talk to Waipa as well. Put that on there, just to jog our memories about, here's something we can actually discuss that affects us immediately, and in our backyard as well. Thanks, Jim.",

So it was just early days testing out concepts like that.  the planting for placentas as a way of potentially providing for that and improving the biodiversity of some of those spaces that are not suitable for burials.

We are working on Plan Change 17, which is the Hautapu Industrial Zones. Draft Plan Change 23, Papakainga. So we have lit a contract out to an external consultant to do the scoping.  for the plan change and to keep that moving. We've had a private plan change 20 for the airport northern precinct extension come in and that's currently on hold while we seek further information. At the same time, we've got the Carter flats, Carter's flat plan change underway, which is plan change 19.  And we have a number of private plan changes currently in discussion. Nothing lodged yet, but it's looking like we will get some private plan changes in between July and September. The share for plan change 26, which is the compulsory government plan change. And it's the one that requires us to allow for intensification.  in all residential zones within the urban boundaries of Cambridge, Te Amutu and Kehekehe. We are currently in the process of writing the plan change and we'll be looking to go out for limited iwi consultation at the end of this month. My apologies up front, it's not how I like to do consultation, but the timeframe the government has given us is that we must notify  on the 20th of August. We had a JMA hui last week, and it was proposed that consultation can keep occurring after notification. So I would be looking for the policy team to keep working with iwi to address any issues that have come up out of the plan change.  We will be having qualifying measures. So we are looking to exempt some residential areas from these medium density residential standards. We will be using the updated flood mapping as one of the qualifying areas. We are looking at heritage character areas. Any qualifying measures that we do has to be done on a site by site basis.  So we are unable to do a blanket exemption. We have to justify it site by site. We are receiving infrastructure review reports at the end of June, and we are looking to use those to support the outcome from Te T\u016bwhawhaimana. So ultimately,  and the protection of the Waikato River and the river catchment will be the number one priority of the plan change. And that is in line with Waikato District Council and Hamilton City Council. So, the three councils are working together to use a vision and strategy as basically the top aim, the umbrella under which the plan changes sit.  and having front of mind at the start from the plan changes that it's the betterment and protection of the river. We can't enable anything that causes further degradation of the river. So that is plan change 26. So big plan change, not really supported by any of the councils who have to do it from the meetings I've been having, but we are just going to get it done.",

We went through actually this in detail.  to explain how that would be actually used as an evaluation tool. What we mentioned is that, like every other framework, those are directing questions. They are not the important part in the evaluation. The important part in the evaluation is the core of the discussion that comes actually with it. And this is really where  the implementability of those aspirations will actually be assessed, be almost dismantled and put together again. This is where the plan is really being put together. The Mataranga Maori framework, like the LTP framework, like the quantitative assessment framework, are only tools and mechanisms to direct those discussions to make sure that there is  a process in place, a structured process in place for this discussion to happen, and for each item, topic, key area, aspirations to be reviewed. So they are only a framework. What is really important is not what happens. What the structure is, is the content of those discussion. That's really where those framework will come alive. As they are, they are words on a piece of paper. We are providing direction to a real career role.  that we need to have on the 30th of June. That's how I see it.

And that's why we have a collection of representatives from different areas of Waipa as mana whenua, because what I might do in my area is different from what could be done in Parawera, for example. And that's dictated to us by our own kawa, or processes. So,  We need to have the discussion because there are differences. Most of us as an iwi in Waipa recognize the differences, but I guess it's important that when it comes down to the basics and to the smaller grouping, that the council has this information.  so that council is, we can be sure that council is really on board from our own disciplines and where we're coming from. So I can, I hear the discussion and I understand there's going to be one further. So I'm really looking forward to that. Thank you. Yeah.",

And then COVID sort of got in the way and many marae closed and we weren't able to meet or anything.  I'm just wanting to pick up this work stream again now that COVID seems to be relaxing our colors and we're in orange and hopefully going to green soon, that we'll be able to pick up on this work stream and get some documentation and have some conversations around using Mirai's if we need to in an emergency as a CDC or a community-led center.  So my reason for coming back to you is just so that we can keep you informed and also to ensure that we get from you the right context for the maraes and the strategies that we will use to connect with them and have the conversations with them around collecting details.  I'm aware that some marae have not yet reopened after COVID and some are wanting to remain closed. I'm not quite sure, but that's where your information would be vital for me to gather the necessary information for me to contact the right people and to make sure we get the right information in the right places.",

And where there's a, if you want to call it a normal civil defence emergency, like a flood, and it's a physical happening event where everybody works together.  and there's no concern about disease spread with COVID, it's a different scenario. And it's interesting now, isn't it, that with COVID going on for as long as it has, probably for a couple of years almost now, it's easy to envisage that we could have the remnants of a pandemic in the community as it is now, and still get a flood.  where a marae might be quite comfortable with supporting a flood event on its own, it may not be suitable if there's still the pandemic in force at the same time.

We've recently, just on the weekend, had a very small and private mana whenua  commemoration of the Matakitaki and Huiputea sites, a commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the invasion from the north, which changed the identity map across the district and brought into being, or put in place, the hap\u016b that we have now in regards to  our modern context. Those went very well. I'm yet to hear back from Makahitaki how well that went. And I think it's less than a dozen people at each site. And that's a peculiar kui putea because of the outbreaks of COVID in the Otorohanga district. There's still quite a bit of that going on there.  The numbers were very small, intimate, and recordings were captured by, I believe, by Waikato Tainui at Matangitaki and the Manipoto FM crew at Huiputea. Waiting to see where the links are so that we can share them around. But those were done on behalf of Huiputea, which is a protective measure for both sides, for both mana whenua and for our manukiri who would have come, of course, from  far north, t\u0113r\u0101 t\u0113r\u0101.

And potentially, it might be that another site where there's not going to be potential parking issues. And I don't know the size of your gathering or anything, what the expectation is at the moment. So, look, we'll follow that up and get back to you really shortly because it's times working against you, I would suggest at the moment.",

So, yeah, as long as everybody's aware at the moment, anything that's talked about is just general chat, which is probably appropriate as we've come to the end of the meeting, probably, and there might be some other issues that people want to bring up. So, Bill, I'll  get the staff working on that request now. But just as a feel with that sort of number of people, I don't know what sort of access you've got onto that property now for making provision for parking and those sorts of things. So maybe thoughts along the race course might be more appropriate, but  Yeah, leave it with us for a couple of days and we'll get back to you, eh? All right. Okay, as Claire has told us, we have lost the quorum, but if we can just receive Shane's report,  We might have to formalise that at the next meeting. Kirsty, I see- I was, through you, Your Worship, I was just going to stop you there and caution that very point that you won't be able to formally receive and approve the report, but that would need to be done at a later meeting.",
