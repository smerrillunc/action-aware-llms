    "text": "Okay, so thanks everybody. Yes, as Gary mentioned, this is essentially just to introduce the annual plan, propose a bit of an approach to it, and hopefully get some elected member direction on that approach, and then have a discussion on some engagement methods and timelines.  So if I just quit over to the next slide, just a bit of a recap, as Garrett did mention, annual plans are a step in between the long-term plan where we  we check in on the second year and see how closely aligned we are to it. And if the change is not significant, then we can carry on with the long-term plan as already agreed with the community, and we wouldn't necessarily have to go through formal consultation, although we would obviously go through some sort of engagement process, and we'd have some checks against our significance and engagement policy during that, as well as discussing with elected members throughout the process.  And yes, this is year two of the long-term plan cycle. So this next slide here just covers off what is in year two, because everything that we prepare along the way will be compared back to this information. So we can see there, we have a proposed rates increase of 4.4%. Then we have the rate increase limit, which is local government cost in ZEX plus 2%.  of 4.9%, we have our debt level going up to nearly 281 million, and we have a capital works programme of 123 million in year two. So just a reminder, everything that we prepare along the way during this annual plan will get compared back to that information that's in the long-term plan.  Okay, so this next slide here is discussing a proposed approach to preparing the annual plan. We are hoping that there'll be minimal deviation from year two of the LTP. And we have had some preliminary discussions with the exec team and the leadership team to discuss how we might want to prepare this annual plan.  What was considered during those discussions is that it's still very early days in the process. It's only really been three months since we've approved that very robust and rigorous LTP, and it all got audited and then formally approved. And to date, nothing has indicated a need to deviate too far from the long-term plan. For example, there haven't been any significant delays to the capital works programme, and we're not aware of anything else that would trigger any significant changes.  But yeah, legislatively, we still need to prepare the annual plan and in preparing that, there'll be a number of checks we do along the way. So I'll just work through those ones there on the slide. So that first one is a check to see what we've achieved in year one. And we'll look to get that primarily through the eight month report, and that will become available around February.  So that'll look at what projects may need to be pushed out into year two. We generate a list of potential changes and then incorporate those into the annual plan.  The next one down there is growth and has it been tracking as expected? Again, we'll have more information on that through that eight month report in February. The development contributions, we'll know more about them too. The fees and charges, we'll have more information on that a bit earlier. We're looking to go out to our budget holders shortly and have them review the schedules of fees and charges. So we'd have more of an understanding of any changes to the fees and charges in November.  Okay, that next one down there about role requests. So we're looking, as I mentioned, we're looking to go out to budget holders and we'll be asking them if any of the teams have any requests for new roles. And we'll be looking to get that information out to them in October and have it come back to us late October and work through it in November.  The next one down there, we'd also look to get back during late October and November is an initial understanding of inflation and interest rates. So the inflation will come to us from Birl and the interest rates will get some information from Bangkok.  Yeah, and so that last point there, essentially, we're not really looking for any new project requests and preparing the plan, with the exception there of the transportation activity, because you'll recall during the LTP that there was that signaled Waka Kotahi funding reduction for transport. So we're going to work through the project changes that result from that, and we want to understand all those impacts by November.",

We have engaged with managers across the organisation to determine timing for those. So they haven't been included in the current plan, but they will be included in the next plan.  long-term plan. There are some that are already underway and there are others that will be programmed through future annual plans and long-term plans. But as you know, that's only recently coming to an end and to be adopted by the council. So that has not yet been formally adopted. There will be a planned approach. We're looking at how we can have oversight as to the implementation of that.  working closely with managers. And one of the proposals is that we coordinate that through the strategy team. Great.

Haven, you mentioned a couple of times that we've got an eight-month report to the end of February, and actually that is reported on, obviously, at the March meeting of Finance and Corporate. But I think it's also important to note that, of course, we will still obviously have our four-month report,  which is the four-month report is through to the end of October. It's reported on in November. And in a couple of slides time, you'll see a timetable talking about some workshops before Christmas. So, yeah, I just wanted to point out to the councillors,  that obviously that will provide quite a bit of information in regard to Haven's first bullet point on this slide. What have we achieved in year one? Of course, we will have a really good preliminary view of that, and in fact, a budget re-forecast reported to you at the end of November, which fits quite nicely with this timing. And then, of course, we do exactly the same thing four months later to the end of February.  So I just think that's an important point to make.",

    "text": " Thanks, Ken. Okay, so if we do just move on to that next slide there, talking about engagement opportunities. So yeah, as we've mentioned, overall, we're hopeful that there will be just minimal changes to the long-term plan, and that we might not be required to undertake a full consultation process, considering we've just been through that rigorous LTP, it would have the additional benefit of reducing some pressure on staff, which would be great if we don't have to do the full formal consultation.  And as I mentioned earlier, of course, this will still need to be tested against our significance and engagement policy in due course and tested with elected members as well. But regardless of what's triggered,  Annual plans are an important planning process for our community. And even if we do not have to fully consult, we would definitely look at what types of other engagement options are available. So just to highlight some of the benefits of some form of engagement on the annual plan, that would be to continue the momentum of the good LTP engagement.  We did hear back from our community that they enjoyed getting face-to-face with some of our staff and elected members throughout certain parts of that process. It would also be a good opportunity to update the community on some key projects. So the Community Spatial Plan, we've got the Urban Mobility Program, and even possibly some of those impacts from central government reform.  And the other thing that we could potentially engage on, or would be good to engage with, is our development community on things like the development contributions.  So, yeah, we're keen to have\u2014we will have these ongoing discussions with elected members throughout this project about how best to go out to our community. And by November, we will have a firmer understanding of the potential changes to the financial situation, as well as any issues that might need to be worked through. So keen to have more of a discussion about engagement methods then in November.  And I guess that takes us over to our final slide, which is the potential timeframe, provided we have support for this approach.  So yeah, we'd look to go out to our budget holders on the 1st of October and then get that information back, process it into our financial system, understand our financial position and workshop that with elected members in early December and have that initial discussion or that further discussion on engagement. Then we would  have a second workshop if needed after the first one. And then we've got down here at the bottom, the formal report coming on the 21st of December. However, I just highlight that I've become aware today that that meeting, it doesn't look like it is happening. I understand the SPMP is being tied up with or joined to council in December. So we might have to have a bit of a redirect of those timeframes to see when's best to come back to get your formal decision on engagement in December.  So yeah, that's essentially an introduction and a proposed approach to the annual plan. So at this stage, I'm keen to open it up for any kind of discussion.",

But yeah, but look, the other thing in regard to the asset sales is, look, I'm not  not necessarily anticipating those having a real impact on delivery of projects. We do obviously have some other financing mechanisms that we can use in the interim while we wait for asset sales to eventuate, if in fact we do have to wait for them to eventuate.  And also, a number of these projects that are being funded by SetSales are happening across the 10 years of the LTP. So yeah, so look, I'm not sure it's anything we need to worry about in terms of projects not being able to advance.  Yeah, we do have a plan in regard to the property strategy and in terms of realising some of those asset sales. And like I say, we have got mechanisms to smooth those out across the years.",

I think I think the recent  Residence Perception Survey has told us that our communities want more engagement and they want more transparency. And the best way to do that is to actually do it and do it really, really well. So the barbecues that we had for the LTP where we went to, like for Cambridge, for example,  to Koot\u016b, to Leamington Domain, to the Lions Market Day. I don't want a diluted engagement process. I want personally a normal annual plan process and we're really engaged thoroughly. So I guess I'm kind of just challenging Haven and Kirsty a little bit to say, hey, I know in past  we, you know, and this is before your time, maybe we haven't gone out with a full hog, but I would really like to see us do this, you know, particularly well.

And in fact, there's perhaps argument that actually the level of engagement with the public could actually be enhanced by using alternative means of engagement, such as the ones you've described.  Councillor Stolwick, without having to do that quite labour-intensive actual consultation following the requirements of the legislation. So, you know, in other words, we locked all of that in.  in the LTP process, which only finished three months ago. Obviously, it would have finished a year ago at the time period we're talking about, but what we're wanting to do is to roll out some really quite cool engagement initiatives with the public reporting on our progress against the LTP, checking in with exactly where the public are,  but we're just talking about that not being in a formal consultation process but using other tools. So, look, I think the challenge for staff here is to come back to, I believe, Haven, you were talking about December in that slide just a few moments ago, with what that engagement process could look like if it's not following the normal format that we would do for an annual plan.  And just being conscious as well that the legislation actually provides for this. So the legislation does provide for where you've got an annual plan and it doesn't depart significantly from the LTP, you don't need to go through the consultation process. As Haven pointed out, we still need to produce an annual plan.  But we don't need to follow that legislative process. The legislation quite clearly provides for that for quite a good reason.",

Yeah, I mean, it's a real balancing act, you know, doing too much or too little, but there's certain members of our community or groups of our community that really do enjoy that one-on-one interaction. And the police did a really great thing a couple of years ago.  They had a function, a morning tea function, I think it was Absolute Cafe, and it was various members of the police came along, all their different groups and departments, and had a meeting, you know, a one-on-one informal meeting with the members of the public, and it was really well received, too. A lot of people turned up to that and spoke to the police.  So that was another way of doing it, you know, morning tea thing and during the day rather than an evening thing too. But yeah, it's a real balancing act trying to, you know, have too much or have too little. And yeah, so it was good.",

But the intention is that there will be engagement. You're aware that we have worked with a stakeholder group. So certainly the intention is that we will be coming back and sharing with elected members and also with stakeholders. In terms of consulting or engaging with the community at large, I'm not sure that  that a decision's been made on that. And there are some constraints around timeframes, but certainly the intention is to take some draft documentation out to share with those stakeholders who have participated in the process to date.",

It's kind of a wait and see kind of approach really, isn't it? Seeing how far we vary. And I'm just really mindful of that fatigue. I think, you know, it's not only us consulting, it's the government's constantly consulting as well. So we've got to be mindful of undertaking relevant consultation and perhaps targeted is probably a really good way of describing it, Kirsty.  I don't certainly advocate for trying to become unapproachable and everything as an entity, but I think you don't just want to consult for consulting's sake. It's got to have a meaning and a defined purpose. So I'm comfortable with where it's at. Thank you.",

I wanted to comment about Liz's mentioning the residents' perception survey.  because I'd be really keen to actually consult with the community or respond to that before the annual plan consultation cycle, because I think there's some really concerning feedback that came through that, and that we really shouldn't delay in, I don't know, engaging with the community about what we could do.  especially about their concerns. So, Kirsty, I picked up that, you know, there's some consultation in a shorter term, I guess, to do with the community plan. And I just wonder whether or not you'd consider weaving into that something that recognises what came through that survey.",

Certainly in terms of that community spatial plan we are meeting with the PCG later today and going to be talking through  some staff recommendations about engagement with stakeholders and the community. So looking at extending that to ensure that there is meaningful engagement. So certainly there are possible avenues for addressing those issues. Thanks.",

And a golden opportunity, I think, when we're talking about annual plans and levels of rates increases and those sorts of things, is to actually talk quite seriously about that value proposition. So I think there's a really good opportunity for us to stitch that into this annual plan process.",
