So let them know that under the current long term plan, the first three years council  has not funded seal extension work. So there's a lull in that type of activity. The priorities, there's Rahuri Road and Grey Road to Miro.  which are roads sort of ahead of Godfrey Road, along with a few others. So that I explained to the residents of Godfrey Road that there is a priority list. It's based on, you know, traffic volumes and dust effects and things like that. And so I gave them all that criteria.  Obviously, they would much prefer that money was being spent every year on seal extension and Godfrey Road was at the top, which is the same as every resident on a gravel road. But I think people are realistic about the program and what it costs and what it takes for council to seal that last sort of 35 kilometres of unsealed road in the district.",

So the second edition has just been delivered by  our wonderful residents and the Scouts as well helped out. So it has been received really, really well. So it's been an opportunity to get some more information out there and to get other communities, sort of the groups connecting together more, which is sort of the role that I've been taking on as the community connector and sort of looking at how we can actually integrate the community a bit more.  as well, which has been a bit of a slow process, but with COVID and whatnot, but it's definitely coming up. We're quite excited for the AGM. Though we have had Susan Trodden, one of our very dedicated committee members, has moved away from the area. So, yes, she's moved to Hamilton, so a bit gutted about that. My right-hand person.  Yes, so we're desperately looking for a couple of other active people who are doers to join to join our committee. Yeah, so we're looking at we've got a couple of residents who are keen to do like a subcommittee for CCTV cameras. So it looks as if we're going to have to fundraise ourselves for those cameras if we want them in the near future. Again, we're having some similar issues.  with doughnutting on the intersections and various different roads within the village and rurally as well. Yeah, Sainsbury Road is one, O'Shea Road and sort of Ross, corner of Ross and Crosier are one of some of the main intersections. Yeah, and the other thing we've been sort of promoting more around about the use of the community halls. We are finding, well, I think it's probably Kimmerty  have been dealing with an ever-growing frustration with council without sort of knowing what we can actually do with the buildings, waiting on maintenance reports. They were due to be done in November last year, but that still hasn't happened due to the contractor not wanting to do a scoping for an extended period of time, which we can understand that because he's trying to cost for something that's going to happen in 10 years time.  But we just, we want to see that building used and we've got groups that are interested, but in its current state, we can't really let people use it. For example, we've got a psychiatrist who wants to do community counselling. We've got the Citizens Advice Bureau who are looking at doing one morning a fortnight. But again, the building won't actually, well, the community building on Crozier Street won't really, it's not fit for purpose yet.  Yeah, so we obviously don't want to spend money on a building, but council haven't made a decision on what's actually going to happen to it.",

So, sitting there like a big white elephant, because there's no jib to  closing the inside properly. Not much you can do about that because everybody's got that problem. And apparently there won't be any new jib being sent out until July or even after that. So we just have to live with it. On a positive note, John Parker, who seems to know an awful lot of people who can help,  managed to get a team in and they have completely repainted the inside of the hall, done up the toilets. The toilets always had a hole in the wall, always had coat hangers missing. Several people had tried to fix it over the years and never quite managed to finish, but now it looks so clean and tidy. I'm sure people will,  Some guys are going to be going in there to go to the toilet and think they're in the ladies' toilet. It's just so tidy.

Apart from Collins Road and Oregons Road, of course, but I don't class that as Koromatoa, but it's just down the road. But they've had boy races for many, many years.  COVID's really hit the hall for the usage. And of course, we adopted what the Waip\u0101 Council, what Bruce Nunns had actually done. He sent me a copy of getting people to actually sign, you know, for hiring the hall, saying that they were going to sanitize before and after and keep a record, et cetera. A lot of people refused to sign it. And I said, well, you can't have the hall. So, but of course,  We've come into orange today, so that actually, well, we're coming into orange, is excellent news. But we've got some people that actually want to know, who want to hire the hall regularly, what is the maximum number?  Well, that's a real problem, finding out the maximum number. And of course, I found out that Bruce Nunn had left, but of course, in December, he'd actually done a report on halls, and we were told that we could only have 50 people, and I thought, well, I can't hire the hall out to 50 people when they want to have a 21st or a wedding or whatever.  So I actually spoke to somebody, I spoke to Carol Wood and then the building consent team and spoke to a gentleman there who was most helpful. And he'd actually gone through the file and apparently this file's available, whether it comes through as a PDF or comes through as hard copy, I'm yet to find out. But he actually went back to 1992  And back to 1991, and then in eight different years, but apparently in 1985, there was a number of 135 people for the hall. So that was good.  I can say that I know there's been a lot more than 135 people in there, but there's work to be done into regards of, we do have fire exits and we do have fire extinguishers, but we don't have a building warrant of fitness, and that's because nobody lives in it, or it's not classed as a new building or an upgrade to a building,  to require that. But it looks like a lot of work's going to be needed into having fire plans for the people hiring it as to where they're meant to meet. There's meant to be a sign on every door saying that you exit and you go to such and such. So I think that's something we can all learn from and perhaps  Council could be a bit proactive in assisting there, I feel, because Council actually own the building. I know we have a lease and we manage the building with that lease, but we're not actually told of these things that are required until we actually ask a question. And I think there could be some sort of guide for people  is something that I'd suggest. But a big thank you for Kieran, and also obviously for Clea and for Bruce. But Kieran, I believe, is the one that solved the problem for us, which we had last year as well. And I hope that we don't have it again next year. And that is waiting for our haul levies to come in. The last couple of years have been a real fight  to get the money that is duly owed to us that the residents have all paid up until the 30th of June, I think it is, your financial year. And we're waiting till March for that money each year, and we shouldn't have to wait that long. We should be able to have that money sooner than that. And it was an issue because I'd used a template on an invoice to the council,  The council computer couldn't read it. Nobody notified anybody that it wasn't readable. I don't know why, because previous, apart from two years ago, it's been accepted. And I use a similar system for another council that I am involved in. And  it's accepted there. But anyway, I've learned from that and was very good at sourcing the issue and obviously the whole being paid the money that it was meant to have. So I think if any of you, the rest of you are involved in halls, I think you need to  double check that you're actually getting your money that is rightfully yours to use to maintain your halls. So that's that really. Yeah, but I'm not looking forward to the boy races coming along. There's a few dips and corners that they could do very well on. But yeah, apart from that, we're  Pleased we're going to Orange, and hopefully we will be able to get some more people hiring the hall, because our expenses are far greater than what the income is with COVID. Yeah, especially when we do need to do some work to the hall. Yeah.",

    "text": "Okay, so let's get to it then. So this is what an annual plan is. It's really the annual budget that sets out  what council's going to do with the activities and services, but it also covers any big issues that we're facing and key projects. Where are we going to, I suppose, the quantum of funding that we're working with and where we're going to get the funding and any changes from the long-term plan, which is what we sort of were working on last year. And so in summary, yeah, it's how we set the rates and other forms of revenue for the next financial year. Yeah, so that's a nice overview.  So next slide. And by having the annual plan process, yeah, it's a chance for staff to review how we're going and yeah, I suppose report back to the community. So messages that we're largely on track in delivering what was planned, but the signaling that there's some challenges facing our community.  and what we might need to be doing in the future, yeah. I guess I've got some other stuff here I could have just read, so I might just do that too. COVID has affected us all, and still things like high inflation rates, changing interest rates, and a turbulent economy with supply chain issues, which you've already heard about actually from Brian, yeah, are causing cost pressures for everyone.  And we also could be facing increases in the cost of materials and building supplies. And then we had the labour market and staff available during things like isolation periods with COVID.  And then there's the general challenge of attracting and retaining staff in these tight labour markets. But we understand these pressures and experience them ourselves in delivering council services, but we also know that this could be impacting on our communities and their own lives. Okay, thank you for that. So now this is the average rate increase, 4.3%. So that's down just by 0.1% from what we had planned in the long-term plan.  And in that long-term plan, which covered 2021 to 31, the expected rates increase for this financial year coming was 4.4%.  which is also the average rate limit that we should not exceed in our planning. And so this annual plan provides for an average after growth rates increase across the district of 4.3%. So I just want to emphasize that's an average rate increase across the district. And so individual rates, individual properties might have different increases.  Yeah, the total average rate increase was actually 7.2%, but because of our high growth rates with the increase in number of rating units, yeah, that accounted for 2.9% of that possible increase. And so that's been able to reduce what we're seeing there at the 4.3%. Thank you.  And this is a great pie chart of where the rates that we collect will be spent. And so it shows the proportion allocated to each of the council's activity groups. But it's important to note that there are other funding sources which are used to contribute to the overall running costs of council and our district. These include development contributions, loans, user fees and charges, external fundraising and central government funding contributions.  Next year, we're planning to spend approximately $176 million on capital projects. And of that $176 million, $120,423,000 is to meet additional demand. $30,815,000 is to improve our levels of service. So it's the services you're already receiving, but we're just, yeah,  increasing the quality or extent of those services. And then $24,499,000 is to replace existing assets. So we're certainly tackling our renewables. OK, thank you. And then the key changes from the long term plan.  There's been very little changed overall. There've been some changes to individual projects, to some being implemented in 2021-22, so that's sooner than was planned originally, and others being implemented later, so pushed back into the 2022-23 years, or even later than that. The projects that are being pushed out to the 2022-23 year mostly relate to infrastructure projects  supporting the development of new residential and industrial areas. So these types of projects include physical work, such as the road urbanisations, installation and upgrade of underground water and wastewater infrastructure, but also include securing the necessary land for public purposes to accommodate future infrastructure, such as roading and stormwater reserve land.  One major change identified in the annual plan relates to the development of the Te Omutu to Pirongia cycleway. That's the one that goes via Lake Ng\u0101 Roto. 5.28 million has been deferred from the 2021-22 financial year into this coming year, 2022-2023, due to delays associated with securing the necessary property agreements for the off-road sections for the  first part, that's Te Umutu to Lake Ngaroto cycleway. And accordingly, the construction of that section one is now planned for this coming financial year, 2022, 2023. Yeah. And I must say that's taken a phenomenal effort, actually, on behalf of our property team to do all those negotiations. We know that it's really desirable to have off-road sections for cycleways because they're much more popular and picturesque, I think,  those using them, but it certainly is a real challenge to get all of the various property owners lined up and agreeable. Thank you. And further changes would be recycling costs have increased by 170,000, and this has been caused by contamination, which is really disappointing.  Recycling bins are not rubbish bins and this is causing an ongoing issue for us. It means there'll be extra costs as we need to send truckloads of contaminated recycling to landfill. To address the high cost of recycling contamination and additional costs to send contaminated recyclables to landfill,  the targeted recycling rate has been increased, or is signaled to be increased. I see this is a draft, so it hasn't happened yet. And then due to funding pressures, Waka Kotahi had not been able to fund their 51% share of the planned urban walking and cycling project for Cambridge and Te Omutu in the three-year period 2021 to 2024.  Council will progress the project, continuing with planning and preparation until funding can be secured. So currently, this is a reduction of 390,000 in revenue. So that's quite significant. Okay, thank you. And these are the key projects coming up. So again, I've been talking about the Te Omutu to the Pirongia route.  We haven't forgot about Te Arawai either, so we'd love to do the concept and design phase for Te Arawai this coming year. District-wide skate parks, I hope actually some of you have been involved with that, or even some of your children or relatives. Yeah, so the two new skate parks in Kihikihi and Pirongia, and then the upgrading of the ones in Cambridge and Te Amutu. And then,  Our growth is continuing full steam ahead. So we've got residential and industrial development happening in growth cells and structured plans that are in line with our WIPA 2050 strategy, which is sort of a longer term strategy about how we manage our growth. We have the Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant.  And so things that are happening there for the summer of 2022-23 are the site clearance, disposal fields, pre-works, and the foundation improvements. And then lastly, we have been working on the Waip\u0101 community spatial plan, and that's going to carry forward into the 2022-2023 year. And this forms a blueprint for all the planning moving forward. Excuse me.  In our case, yeah, the Waip\u0101 Community Spatial Plan is a 30 year plus roadmap. Okay, so next slide. So that's been a pretty summarized overview, but what are you gonna get for your rates? So you can check out the proposed rates calculator on our website. And we often put it in the chat actually for our Zoom meetings,  I'm sure that you can find it on the Waip\u0101 District Council website. And so you just put in the address of your property and it'll give you what, I think it shows what the existing rates were for this financial year and what the proposed ones will be so you can work out any increases and what the changes are. So next slide, and that sort of sets out that how to have your say  So yeah, we'd love to get any feedback from anyone in this meeting, anyone in your communities. The Piongi Award Committee themselves can do a collective submission if you'd like. And I think I just saw a little message in chat there to say that something's, yeah, the infographics are available here.  add a particular link that's been put in the chat for you all to access if you like. And so the submissions are open until the 20th of April. So you've still got some time to do that. And then any changes take effect from the 1st of July, 2022. As I said, the whole idea is to set the scene for how we're gonna manage the activities of council and how they're funded for the coming financial year which starts on the 1st of July. Yeah.  So with that, yeah, we're open for questions. And if there was anything in particular that you saw that I just skipped through and you'd like a bit more detail, I'm happy to go back to that slide and take advantage of any of the great staff experts that are in on this call as well so that you can have a really detailed answer to your questions. So I see Janet with her hand up.  So Janet, would you like to go first, please?",

    "text": "That's interesting feedback. I think that situation would be quite rare. The bins do have stickers and stuff printed into the surface of the lids saying, you know, no rubbish, it is recycling.  Yep, I can imagine that there could be some confused or ratepayers or residents who might make that mistake. But on the whole, what we're finding is that the contamination is one of two things. So it's things that look like they should be recyclable. And, you know, if you  if that battery pack on your electric drill stops working and you turn it upside down, it's got a recycling symbol on the bottom of it. But, you know, if you put that in your rubbish bin and it gets crushed in the truck, it'll burst into flames and, you know, cause devastation. But people, it's that sort of education thing. They see a recycling symbol, so they stick it in the bin and disregard all of the information that has been provided and the information on top of the bins that say what can and can't be put in the bins.  So there's that type of mistake made, but then there is really that deliberate using the bin to dispose of stuff that people don't want to pay for a rubbish service or go to a transfer station.  The more noxious stuff is cans of paint and drums of waste oil, medical waste, veterinary waste from people's home farms where they think all those plastic tubes and needles and things should be recyclable.  So some of it you would scratch your head and say, you know, people can't really be this stupid, can they? But it's that, I think, deliberate, this is a convenient place to put it, it'll be hidden in there and I'll get away with it and somebody else will, you know, wear the cost. And so that's the real problematic contamination that we have.  that once you can imagine a can of paint, that truck lifts up the bin, it goes into the back of the truck, and there's a big paddle that sort of squashes it into the back of the truck to make more space, and that breaks open the can or the drum or whatever, and it spreads throughout all that material.  and they don't know it's in there and they get it back to the plant and they tip it out on the floor or it goes up the conveyor belt and into the equipment. And hello, it's spread through a lot of stuff. So yeah, major cost. And so those are really the types of contamination that we need to crack down on or have been cracking down on with those audits and the like and education. But we really do need to make further inroads to stopping that.",

We shouldn't lose track of the fact that 90 percent of the residents in the district do use the recycling bins well and are getting a great service out of it because, you know, not only are they those materials being recycled,  But if they didn't have that recycling service, they would be having to pay to put out, you know, an extra bin full or bag full of rubbish every week that would end up in a landfill. So, you know, from a price perspective, it is actually really good value for money for the residents of the district not to have to pay to dispose of rubbish. Yes, they're paying a rate for the recycling service,  but it would still be cheaper than what they would have to pay if they were having to dispose of it all into a rubbish type service. So if we can get that remaining sort of five to 10 percent doing it well, then yes, it certainly is good for the district and good for our residents.",

So, with regards to the delay on the cycleway between Te Amudu and Purongia, what sort of things have been put in place to prepare Purongia for that increase of activity, whether it be like parking for bikes or maybe people doing park and rides, or people riding and then families picking them up? Because we are quite limited with regards to parking and there's already a bit of congestion around about where they can park at intersections, for example, by the pub.  and visibility is greatly reduced there when you're coming out across your street heading north.

It has got some wide streets like Crozier Street, which if  if parking becomes an issue, we can mark parking spaces and use well the close streets to that main street area for people to park and then go on their bike rides. Certainly, there's a lot of capacity to do that. But probably what would be even better would be for those users to park. I know myself, whenever I go to Porongia for some walks or other activities and  We park in the pub car park and go and do our activity and then go and have a drink and a meal at the pub afterwards. And there is lots and lots of parking capacity there frequently. So I would say generally, Prongia does have lots of parking as long as we make sure it's used well and people can identify the places where they should and shouldn't park.  So I don't think that would be an issue. But I don't know whether Brad or others have got some ideas as well, because there will be people going to Prongier for other recreation activities, and he might have some ideas, too. I was going to say, I probably wouldn't rely completely on the area behind the pub, because that, as far as we know, is planned to be developed fairly soon.",

And you might have seen Te Amaru construction has commenced now as well, which is good because it's ahead of schedule of the year two programme, which is good. With Porongia and Kiki, with both sites, we have done a desktop exercise as staff  to work out potential sites and locations for these parks. And we've taken that to Ng\u0101ui T\u014dpua Waipa, and their advice was to share those with their respective marae committees. So our next step for Pr\u0101ngere specifically is to go and meet with Purikiriki Marae and just share our staff's preferred sites, I guess, or the sites that we think would work best. And then once we've got that  feedback from mana whenua, then we'll share those with the community to see which two or three sites would be, you know, most receptive from the community's point of view. So a couple of steps to go before we can confirm the location. And then obviously the design will fall out of that as well.",

One of them is the house at Franklin Street's being removed. In relation to the TA to Pirongia cycleway, progress on the first sections progressed pretty well in the last couple of months.  that we've almost got a contiguous route between Te Amutu and Lake Naroto. And we are now working with landowners affected in stage two. So from Sing Road through to Pirongi. So that's progressing now. And yeah, I'm hopeful to have the first section, most of the agreements in place, but there are some  on some of those agreements that we just need to fulfil to get that contiguous route. The other issue is the forest harvesting up Sainsbury Road. We decided on Monday to put that off given that someone started a war in Ukraine, petrol prices, diesel prices have gone through the roof, timber prices have dropped somewhat. There's a whole bunch of logistical issues  Matt Constable's iPhone 2.  And we were getting closer and closer to winter. If we had started, we probably would have had rain from now to September. If we don't start, we probably won't have any rain. So some of these things you can't win. So that is put on hold. Hopefully there's been some comms go out around that.

Okay, great. That's good. And then we had some stuff that was returned as well because it wasn't required in the end. That's cool. And so,  We just have to receive that report, don't we, Kieran? There's nothing else that we need to do there?",

So the recommendation on page 65 is that the report of the financial accountant for the period ending 31st of March 2022 be received. So I'd like to have a mover and a seconder, please, for that. Thank you, Alan, and thank you, Janet. All in favour, please say aye or raise your hands. Against. Carried. Cool. Thank you. All right. And then we have a separate item for the Pirongi School Discretionary Grant.  And I just want to thank you, Kieran, for handling that and making sure we had all this information. So you will recall that we allocated Pirongi School $1,500 for the operating costs of the school pool, generally over the summer. But because of COVID, the school didn't open the pool to the community, and Kieran's  touched base with the school again, and we've had an update from them, and you've had that email to read, which is on page 71. So in fact, the email does say that even though they didn't open it to the public, they still incurred those expenses totaling about $3,500. Kieran, is there anything else you'd like to add?  since you're more familiar with this than I am.",

Now, at the beginning of our meeting, just before we started, we did get a note that there were some queries from some of the members on some of the financial information, which is in the public excluded part of the agenda.  I'd like to deal with that first. And so I'm proposing that we have that recommendation to exclude the public while we just discuss those particular items relating to the public excluding information. And then we will come back into public and do our deliberations for the applications. Okay.  So with that, on page 201 of our agenda, we have a resolution, which is that the public be excluded from the following parts of the proceeding of this meeting, and the reasons for that is given there.  Now, do I have to read it out or anything, Kieran, or is that enough for us to use to get a mover and a seconder?",
