    "text": " Good afternoon, Your Worship and Councillors. Living with COVID is perhaps the biggest challenge currently facing New Zealand. So far, COVID has cancelled our travel plans, put many of us in work-from-home mode, restricted who and where we can meet, and curtailed our business activities. Basically, COVID has changed our lives. Living with COVID will be part of our future in the wide park.  After the first lockdown, the Waipara economy bounced back strongly, largely on the back of the primary sector. However, the pain of the pandemic is not even once you get below the headline numbers. The visitor industry, aviation, retail, hospitality, accommodation have all been badly affected. Consumer values and purchasing patterns have changed since the pandemic.  While local businesses have embraced online ordering and deliveries, click and collect, many will still suffer from supply chain issues in the slow, anxious crawl to Christmas. Some consumers may have permanently changed their behaviour. I'd like to introduce Chris Wilkinson from First Retail and Lorraine.  who's going to talk about the effect of COVID on consumer facing businesses, particularly our CBDs. Chris will discuss initiatives and issues, sharing what has worked well across New Zealand and overseas. His presentation links to other council work streams like COVID recovery programme, economic wellbeing strategy, the community spatial plan, town concept plans,  and various other initiatives in play. First Retail last presented to Cambridge retailers in 2019. At this time, I thought it was useful for the insights to be shared with elected members and staff. And as a thought starter, given the other work streams in play. First Retail Group are experts in developing potential, driving performance and managing risk in consumer facing sectors.  including retail, hospitality, healthcare, and tourism. So now I'd like to introduce you to Chris Wilkinson, Managing Director of First Retail, based out of Wellington. Chris will share his screen and take you through his presentation, and we have an opportunity for Q&A at the end of his presentation. Chris, over to you.",

    "text": " Hi, Steve, and hi, our friends up in the Waikato. We're very proud to be here today, I guess, on this auspicious day on the eve of the reopening. And I also want to congratulate yourselves on this initiative and getting some shared understanding of what's going on out there, both in the economy, but also in our town centres.  As Steve's mentioned, we've worked closely with Waip\u0101 District Council over a number of years, and we've stayed very close to what's going on there. We've also worked for Hamilton City Council in the past as well.  Steve's mentioned that we work extensively around town and city centres, so yes, we've delivered projects for pretty much most of the progressive councils from Auckland down to Invercargill. We've delivered projects around the world, including the UK and Singapore.  At the moment, we're proudly part of the Expo 2020, which is happening in Dubai. It's a New Zealand government initiative. We work for the Australian governments in places like Phillip Island. We're working with clients in Fiji right now, and Fiji has opened back up to international markets this week.  delivering projects around town and city centers that are evolving. This week we're in Whanganui in the next couple of days. And we've also got projects happening right now across the Wellington area, which we're based around transport changes. So movements to mass transit and cycle and better walking and active transport modes.  So as Steve's mentioned, our relationship with Waip\u0101 started back in 2017, where we ran a number of workshops for businesses and property owners in Te Awamutu. That gave us a huge insight into the dynamics of the Waikato.  We've just come out of working for Hamilton City Council on their city centre changes that we're kind of starting to see now benefiting the city centre in terms of greater residential activity in there and some new property developments.  In terms of rural New Zealand, we work extensively through the provinces, so we've worked a lot in Southland, Gore, Balclutha, worked right throughout Otago, most recently working in Wairarapa, Taranaki, and as I mentioned, Whanganui at the moment too. So yes, we've had a  a great time working with Steve. Long relationship, Steve, and I know we've spoken to a number of you, the councillors, at sessions in the past as well. So today's session, what we really want to do is, I think we've got about half an hour to 40 minutes here, talking about some of the trends that are going on, the relevance for Waip\u0101's town centres,  How, through some agile strategy, council can support some of the changes that we're starting to see right now. How do we get there? So some of the initiatives you can undertake and some of the priorities from our perspective, the things that you can actually do to get some of these activities happening.  OK, so I'm just going to kick off with some of the key trends that we're seeing both across New Zealand, but also particularly within our provincial centres. And these will be no surprise for many of you.  sort of key trends that we've seen since COVID. Those shifts in purchasing channels, that means that people have increasingly gone online. In many cases, they've been forced to go online. So traditional demographics that have never been used to purchasing products through their computers or their phones, it's been something that they've had to do. So it's seen a seismic shift in purchasing behavior changes. From demographics, we never would have necessarily thought  So older people have had to be part of this. Young people have gotten earlier than they would have traditionally. And while online spending was growing, it's significantly increased since the advent of COVID.  We talk about captive spending and how it's changed the New Zealand economy. So New Zealanders typically spend nine billion a year on overseas travel. Without that ability to travel, a lot of that money has stayed in our economy. And you've seen it translated into those huge queues of the likes of Mitre 10 and Bunnings. You've seen it translated into people putting money into their home environments, the amount of landscaping that's going on.  the amount of additions, people spending in places like briscoes. In times that we're seeing right now where there's a degree of uncertainty, people hunker down and they love to do what we call nest, and that's getting those good things around them, making sure their home environments are right.  We've also seen those big changes around flexible working, which has meant people have spent more time in their home environments, and they've found reasons that they needed to go and enrich those. So that has particularly helped many of the businesses around the Waikato, those home interiors businesses, construction supplies, plumbing supplies. Across the board, there'll be few businesses that haven't benefited that are involved in these sectors.  So we talk about lifestyle being a priority. People are increasingly concerned about getting those good things around them, things that make them feel good, almost like a security blanket for an adult, essentially.  We also talk about experiences being priorities, and you will have seen the times you've been out to cafes or out to restaurants, you'll see people spending more on premium type foods, and that's all because of the fact that people are wanting to, again, enrich their lifestyles.  With these types of purchasing behaviors, it's really played well into many of the artists and businesses that we have in our town centers. It's played well into the cafes when they have been able to open and the restaurants when they have been able to open, despite the fact that at the moment, many people have got constraint through the ability to get capacity in those environments.  Property prices obviously are buoying confidence so people are feeling kind of dare I say artificially wealthy and that has really pushed people's confidence in investing in big ticket items like furniture  home improvements like we talked about, new vehicles and all of these aspects. So, you know, it's pretty interesting. It has confounded economists, it's confounded many of us who are dealing with these types of economies around New Zealand and around the world. So I guess we really didn't realise just the power of what that captive spend would do.  So the other thing we've noticed is that consumers are increasingly values driven, particularly our young, so they're looking to, you know, spend their money with where it counts, and that in many cases has meant local businesses have benefited from that priority.  So that's about supporting local, but we've also seen people strongly supporting those businesses that are doing the right things in communities as well. So whether that be, you know, giving money or goods to the food banks,  doing sustainability initiatives and all of these types of things, consumers are increasingly orientated towards values driven businesses. So that's an important thing to think about for our businesses, but also collectively our town centres as well.  So those are the kind of good things that are happening at the moment, but we kind of need to be aware of the emerging issues. So what are we seeing ahead? And these are things that ourselves as a business that dealing in a lot of these environments are seeing, but also many of the others that we work with. So the economists, the banks, major property owners, large retail groups,  So while we saw a really significant bounce in that economy after the first lockdown, and that was driven by people kind of surprised with where things got to, maybe we felt like we were getting off with a lot less impact than other places had,  The feeling now is that we are going to see a more likely, a limited bounce on reopening. So we're not going to see that unleashing of spending. Yes, we're coming up to a Christmas period right now, so that's a typical spending boost anyhow. But there is concern that we won't necessarily see that boost this time around. And there's reasons behind this.  One is that the increase in interest rates will, without a doubt, slow spend. We know that people are fairly highly leveraged out there, and despite the fact that they're feeling pretty happy about their property prices, we do know that that market is starting to cool off. So the messaging coming through from agents and property sector in general is that some of that bullish behavior is starting to come back from consumers, and there's a little bit more reticence out there.  We know that the property market has really underpinned that confidence in spend. Great news about the milk prices. We just know how that drives that confidence in our rural economies. We've seen that particularly around the likes of Gore and Otago. But if we think about the general consumer market, property is the kind of thing that they are most concerned with. So that's combined to create less economic certainty.  And then we've also got this other consideration to supply challenges are impacting the economy. So businesses aren't necessarily able to get the products that they need to sell. That means they're losing potential sales and also potential goodwill. So these are real considerations that are impacting across most sectors at the moment.  So how does that differ from 2020? Again, we go back to same time last year, and we were all kind of feeling in a pretty confident position. We had come out of COVID, yet the rest of the world, well, we thought we'd come out of COVID, the rest of the world was facing some pretty dire straits.  But right now, with the advent of Delta, that COVID in the community is a huge threat. If anyone saw the Stuff article about what's gone on in Taranaki today, the impact that it's had on the town centre, those rural town centres, has been significant. People have just stopped spending, except for those places that have had to spend. So the uncertainty of this,  Last night, we presented Te Kapiti District Council and in a very same sort of similar type of thing, but in an area where there's a very large older population and the concerns older population have from being in these types of environments is significant. And so many councils right now are considering how best to support resilience in their communities.  So yes, with this COVID in the community, Delta in the community, there's a high perceived risk and uncertainty from consumers. Doesn't take much to stem the spending flow and that confidence.  Spending's already come back from last year. So yes, people went on a big spending spree. In many cases, they've kind of got what they wanted. There's little else that they need. And we saw a very similar trend in Australia, too. We work extensively through New South Wales and in Queensland.  And in New South Wales, many of those big retailers that saw a huge growth after their first lockdown, after the second lockdown, that spending did not come back. So there are some learnings that we can take from some of these other areas around.  I talked about working overseas. We watch markets that we've worked in in the past very closely. In the UK at the moment, there's a lot of concern and there's likelihood that they'll go back into mask wearing, compulsory mask wearing. So fascinating just some of these dynamics that are going on and how it's resonating in those town centres and city centres.  And we're also, we're hearing a lot in the media about those wider economic indicators and headwinds. So, you know, the challenges of managing some of this big debt that's going on at the moment and wider concerns that people are having.  And there are some new threats as well. So that's the trending pandemic related challenges. Permanent change in consumer behavior. When people have been unable to, we call it transformational behavior. So if there's something that you do on a regular basis and you can't do it for a week, there's a high likelihood that you will go back to that.  But over a period of time, you actually get out of those types of typical habits, those habitual type destinations. And so, for instance, those coffee places that you went to every week or every day, you may find new choices. And these are the things that have been impacting businesses across New Zealand and across the world. So that permanent change in consumer behavior.  And similarly online, if you typically went and bought products in the store for many years and all of a sudden you have to deal with that retailer online, there's a high chance that you'll continue to do that. That's what we've seen.  In terms of Waip\u0101, at the moment there's this loss of that Auckland drive market visitor, and they've been really propelling spend in Waip\u0101, so that time away people could come down and they'll be buying those gift items, things to make themselves feel good, experiences to make themselves feel good.  And this is a similar trend that we've seen in other characterful areas. We've worked a lot in Nelson, so similar situations in Nelson. The Wairarapa, so Greytown is a very, very popular destination at the moment, benefiting significantly from that drive market from Manawat\u016b, but also from Wellington.  Cancellation of events, we're just seeing these are falling off around the country like dominoes. So yesterday, again, we were working for Kapiti District Council, the big food fair that attracts many thousands of people was cancelled yesterday. And there's a lot likelihood that anything that's planned for the next few months will be cancelled because there is just this huge uncertainty right now. Go back to the loss of retail anchors in  in Waip\u0101, so the likes of the Bunnings that consolidated into a larger site, all of those businesses bring people on a regular basis to an area. Similarly with banks, although the banks have had a lot less of a need, but they are still destinations where people visit on a regular, habitual basis.  And those visits typically coincide with other visits, so trips to the coffee shop or trips to other businesses in the area. What makes Te Aumutu and Cambridge extra special? Of course, it's characterful buildings, and many of those are earthquake-prone buildings. Being based in Wellington, that's been part of our lives for decades. But for other areas, it's new territory.  And for those smaller properties in provincial centres, they're quite expensive to get earthquake proofed, and in many cases, it's a challenge for property owners in terms of economic return on those.  Indie, those mum and dad businesses that are through Waip\u0101, they are the ones that make Waip\u0101 special. And when we lose those types of businesses, that's a real challenge because with the chain businesses, you can find those anywhere. The mum and dad businesses are the ones that set the place apart. And if we ask consumers, it's those places that people are wanting to go to.  And finally, inactive frontages, you will all recognise this happening around our town and city centres. So the loss of a store and then a physiotherapist goes in and frosts the window, or other types of office type users, they break precincts and they are quite challenging in terms of creating that vitality and that vibrancy in a town centre. So how does it impact businesses?  At the moment, reinvestment capital is lacking in the retail sector, retail and the hospitality sector, and particularly tourism. And that confidence impacts appetite for growth.  Banks are very reticent about supporting retail, hospitality, or tourism sectors because of the uncertainty in trading performance. Uncertainty in trading performance, uncertainty in terms of supply chain. So we've seen a lot less willingness from banks to support retail. In fact, talking to a retail shop fit out specialist, he said, we've got virtually no inquiry from New Zealand retailers. This is a big shop fit out.  yet Australia still has that confidence. But in many cases, those businesses are self-funding that work. With the changes that the government's made around less obligations, property owners are often subsidizing tenants now, so that's meant that property owners haven't had that capital to reinvest in their properties, whether that be facades or strengthening or other types of improvements.  And then again, we've got this caution in employment. So while we've got pretty full employment at the moment, in many cases,  that people start their working journey, their work-life journey. So, less appetite for businesses to employ those school leavers. Cost creep and limited ability for wage growth across these sectors is meaning that there's greater competition for retail and hospitality workers. That's seen businesses reduce their hours, really because they just haven't had that capacity to be able to manage.  So less certainty impacts confidence and appetite for investment for our commercial stakeholders across our town and city centres. But you know, Waip\u0101 has got some special edge, these resilience factors around its rural resilience. We've just heard about that before.  know, right through COVID, I guess probably one of the most beautiful comments. We did a lot of work with Gore District Council around right through COVID, working with all the sectors and bringing them together for some joined up conversations. And I never forget one of the stakeholders saying, Chris, welcome to our world. You know, we've  lockdown, that's our environment in many cases because we're confined to the farm and we've just got to head down and tail up for weeks on end. So this is not new territory for us. So the rural resilience is a major factor, something we can't take for granted, but it's something that we should be celebrating.  Residential growth, of course, that growth in property values has been significant, and that spinoff from Auckland has been significant as well. So one of the things we saw back in 2019 when we talked to stakeholders in Cambridge,  was the significant contribution that many of those older folk had made coming into the Cambridge economy from Auckland as they'd sold up large properties and were keen to contribute to Cambridge's economy.  strong, cohesive business communities. The Cambridge Chamber is absolutely outstanding, great leadership, significant participation across many sectors. And I guess we were really humbled when we were part of those conversations just to see so many different sectors participating from architects very keen to  to see regeneration, sympathetic regeneration happening through to businesses that were wanting to help each other. And again, that leadership of the chamber with support of Waip\u0101 District Council's ED team was really gratifying to see. I think that's one thing that sets Waip\u0101 apart significantly.  Equally, you've got champions in the private sector. We met a number of leading property owners when we were working TA, all keen to put money into their properties without necessarily that immediate return, but their hearts were in Waip\u0101, and they saw the need to make sure that the town centre stayed strong and resilient, both for social and economic reasons. And then finally, those emerging",

    "text": "Can I back in now, guys? Oh, you're there now. Sorry, shall I just back up again? Where did you lose me? Merging sectors.  OK, fantastic. OK, so the emerging sectors, what we're talking about here really is the growth of tech in terms of software and also some of the agricultural tech and large scale manufacturing that's happening out on the fringes.  So this is really exciting for the area. It's bringing in many cases high value roles and it really is leveraging the ability for people to benefit from lifestyle and that wonderful environment that you have without having to do that travel.  I'm not sure whether we are touching on the flexible working environments, but we're working in a number of areas which have seen significant growth because those people aren't leaving every day. So hopefully I'll touch on that shortly. I'm pretty sure I do. Waip\u0101's edge. So leveraging differentiation. So there's characterful, differentiated destinations.  We know these are the things that consumers love, things that are different. People are tired of that same old, same old. And I know that people will constantly say, oh, we can go across to Hamilton. But at the end of the day, that offer and experience is a very, very different one. So it's about finding those things that you guys can succeed in and own, essentially. So where's YPAR's opportunity?  Number one is stemming that spending attrition. So a significant amount of money leaves economies across New Zealand every day. But Waip\u0101, we knew from when we were working there, a significant amount was going over to Hamilton, not only for the people that were working there, but for people that were going for hospitality experiences or entertainment.  So if we can work hard on encouraging that local sentiment and local support for businesses because  You know, people are often pretty close to their local town centre, and yet they take things for granted. It's easy to take things for granted, but when we visit Cambridge or TA, you know, we're always delighted with the wonderful stores and hospitality environments you have there. So sometimes it's kind of worth just reorientating people to re-engage them with their local offer, reminding them of that.  As a rural, as an agricultural powerhouse, it's important to be leveraging our provenance, the things that we're actually producing locally, and those artisan businesses that are actually using those types of products within their menu items.  I know that the Chamber have been really keen to see more and more of that, so local sourced menu items on a regular basis across as many menus as they possibly can in the area.  further developers these regional destinations. I think this is a really important part, you know, it's a great drive across from the Bay of Plenty or down from Auckland and what you find in places like Cambridge is a very characterful and unique shopping environment.  Most recently, we've been working in the Southern Wairarapa, and many people will know just how successful Greytown has been in transforming its proposition and experience by assembling a great range of interesting and, as I say, experiential type retail and hospitality environments. So that's something to, you know, we've got lots of great examples of these kinds of things happening, but Cambridge has always been thought of as one of those iconic destinations as well.  And then we talk about further curating offer and experience. Yes, we've got some great stuff going on, but we've also got some stuff that's pretty average as well. So if we're able to get and support some of these property owners and businesses to keep evolving, helping them better understand their market and the opportunities that are there, these are key parts. And I know this is a role that Steve and the ED team have been playing significantly.  encouraging businesses to better understand their market and the opportunities that exist within those.  I'll go back to the Cambridge Town Centre concept plan. So, you know, that's been a fantastic blueprint for where Cambridge can do particularly well. And it's worth going back to these types of objectives and then ensuring that we are contemporising our understanding of those and making sure that we are leveraging those, particularly in this very dynamic market.  demand expectations and values are changing significantly from our consumers. So what can we do to respond? Well, number one is that hospitality sector is our new anchor. You know, once upon a time, retail was the anchor. But today, it's the coffee shop that you'll be going to on a regular basis. And it's those types of businesses that we've got to further strengthen to support because  hospitality sector, our retail sector follows through. Hospitality is the reason that people come and connect with a town centre or an environment. And then, once they're in those areas, that spending is shared, so people have that connection with neighbouring retail businesses. Hence the reason you'll see more and more hospitality in malls and other big shopping destinations.  While we can't favour any one sector, we just need to be mindful that hospitality is a key, key thing that connects people on a regular and habitual basis, and that will help drive retail success as well.  Particularly now, and we've got lots of good learnings for what's going on overseas, but creating those environments that enable resilience. So that's a key aspect, particularly with the advent of Delta. And capacity. So as we've seen, you know, businesses not being able to fill their restaurants because of the spatial space requirements. So being able to create that capacity is vital.  We're working with a number of councils right now on activating street spaces on a temporary basis, but hopefully permanently, to enable hospitality venues to create safe and capacious environments. So this is something that many councils are now giving pace to and in some cases, removing the costs of licensing for outdoor areas,  creating shared spaces so that people can, so that businesses can share some of these spaces together. We've done a lot of work around Love Local, celebrating local businesses, but celebrating and prioritising those local businesses is something we need to keep re-emphasising. It's something that needs to be a constant theme from our town centre leaders, from our elected members,  creating reasons and experiences to re-engage people with the town centre. So while we can't have big events at the moment, we can do small things. We can create small activities that people may encounter when they come into their town centre.  At the moment, we've been working with Wellington City Council as they've pivoted from a big Christmas event to more likely small little pocket type things that people will just encounter when they come and do their Christmas shopping. So magicians, street performances, small sing songs and things like that. So people will come and find these  and kind of warm to them and talk fondly about those as opposed to a big events that are no longer appropriate in this current environment.  And then finally strengthening that differentiation to ensure the townships have got a defensible edge, something that sets them apart from their competing destinations. So what's that? That's really around supporting great hospitality experiences, ensuring our businesses are listening and responding to the markets, and creating something that other places just haven't got.  our second immediate focus to collaborative efforts. And again, this is where that relationship, that strong relationship with the chamber and that strong understanding from the ED team is particularly important. So collaborative efforts, enabling outdoor dining environments and that culture of connection. So encouraging people to come into the town centre on a regular basis for social connection, for  just to enjoy themselves. Again, re-emphasising the value of the town centre for its social benefit. Low-key town centre activities I just talked about, that people encounter, they take part in and they talk fondly about.  Devising enabling ways for locals to rediscover their town centres, so whether that be some pop-up pocket parks, that type of thing that starts to encourage new demographics into our town centres, or people that may have strayed their loyalties and they may have strayed to other areas, bring them back in to show what's gone on and the changes that have happened.  talked about celebrating local priorities and the customers that are leading the charge, so talking about some of the good things that are going on and our customer champions out there.  And then helping the town centres develop these values-led initiatives, such as environmental shifts. That might be more walking and cycling. That might be enabling greater sustainability focus from our town centres. All the things that contemporary consumers are increasingly looking for. So if we get it right, what would that success look like? So greater commercial confidence through shared thinking and resilience.  And this means that businesses are working together increasingly, and we're going to need to see more of that through in this Delta age. We're going to need to see businesses potentially supporting others by selling their products if they're not able to open. We're needing to show our town centres as cohesive environments to come to as maybe stores aren't able to open because they're impacted by Delta.  Active and vibrant town scenes draw people through their vitality, so just environments that people want to be part of. Consumer preference, that priority and advocacy for local traders, so we can't overstate that enough. These businesses really do need that support right now, and we can do this meaningfully through these types of initiatives. And again, businesses leading up to sustainability and social initiatives, it's absolutely vital.  So, and I know we kind of share this vision with Steve, but where to from here? So, channeling the town centres and businesses to capture a greater share of local spend. Councils have got that great reach out to their audiences, and it's important that we kind of leverage that reach to be able to send some of these positive messages and drive that confidence.  Supporting the creation of spaces and places to respond to the need and opportunity. So again, we talked about pop-up pocket parks, pop-up dining environments, things that are going to enable the success for businesses and support businesses who are keen to  enable this collaborative plan to strengthen economic resilience and living and operating with Delta. So, this is continuing. We've got teams at the moment who are working with councils right now in looking at the things that the councils can do to support businesses in those environments as we navigate this kind of uncharted territory.  strengthening awareness and priority for Waip\u0101 as a visitor destination. So as soon as the borders are opened up, that people, as they start to come back, let's make sure that they're going to prioritise their spending here in Waip\u0101.  And then using this opportunity to further curate the town centre's office and experience. So I know what we've seen in other areas is businesses have disappeared because maybe of COVID vulnerability that the councils and the chambers have worked collectively to encourage the right types of businesses that are going to add value, add best value to the neighbours and to those town centres. Very important. It's something that can happen quite easily.  Coming up to the end now, but what other moves can support success? We've seen in other areas councils considering land purchase in the city centre. We've worked with a number of councils that are doing that around New Zealand, and it's a big move in the UK right now. So councils are very busy purchasing properties, strategic properties that will enable them to have regenerative effect.  Auckland City Council is a large property owner and we've worked extensively with them and the likes of Panmure and Orihanga and Glen Innes around some of these moves to purchase property. So, that's something to think about. There's plenty of precedents out there to support it. Strengthen these commercial communities to support greater resilience. So, the work that the Chamber is doing, being able to add value to that.  Dedicated town centre strategies to look at contemporary solutions. So again, this is where we were in 2019, but where do we need to be in 2022?  And that strategic curation of the town centre offers and experiences to create differentiation. So again, we're looking at a very dynamic space at the moment, but if we're able to leverage some of these opportunities, we can start creating environments that people just want to come to, want to be part of, and want to invest in. So I don't know how we're doing for time, guys. How's that looking?",

A lovely story we had from Gore when we worked on their local spending strategies about six years ago. And we had a call from a big jeweller there in Gore.  And I mean, Gore's not dissimilar from TA, a huge dairy stronghold there, and a lot of wealth within that community in terms of spending potential. Anyhow, the council had initiated a Love Gore promotion, which has continued to this day. Every store has Love Gore on its door, and it's constantly reinforced in the media and by the elected members.  Anyhow, a woman was wanting to buy an expensive graduation bracelet for her daughter, and she was heading down to Dunedin to buy it, and she got to Balclutha, and something clicked in her brain. She thought, why am I driving down here?  went back to the joula and told them the story and spent a significant amount of money. So it's those types of things, I think personalising, showing just the value of those local businesses to the community and just how important they are in our lives.",

    "text": "Cool, so Chris and Lorraine, lovely to see you guys again. It's always a value platform listening to your roundup and trends and ideas and thank you for your favourable comments on the chamber as well. I just made a few notes in no particular order. First of all around the shop local and obviously the chamber is a huge advocate of that. We have a brand totally locally, Cambridge, and  It is a brand that we make no money off whatsoever. It's there as our little hidden gem to advocate in that space. And we've got a really fresh new program coming in 2022. And we would certainly encourage anybody within council businesses or the likes to uplift and use that brand. And obviously it could be extended and replicated very simply in Te Awamutu as well. So carry on thoughts on that one.  In terms of your reference to social and community connection, Liz Stoick, myself, and a couple of others have been working. In fact, we had a session last night called Reimagine Cambridge, and Steve was on board as well. And that is very much looking at that outdoor dining and looking at ways in which to draw people into our townships and let them then disperse into our restaurants and cafes. So there's some nice work going on in that space.  And one of the things, for example, we're investigating is a night market up in the town square. So, you know, it just has that wonderful visibility and feel and fit. So around safe socialization, market days and the likes of, obviously to coincide this year with Centres Visit. I think also it's interesting  And I'm pretty new to the region, I've only been down here a couple of years, but the ongoing debate, do we market our districts as Waip\u0101?  or do we separate the townships? And I think certainly where people are, we're looking to change consumer behaviours and making new choices. We do enjoy, certainly in Cambridge, wonderful patronage and destination shopping from the greater Waikato, whether that be Hamilton or Matamata, and actually stretching them through our region a bit more, I think has enormous potential  So let that Waip\u0101 debate continue and look at some clever ways in which we take ourselves to market and educate people that we are a district of our own outside of, you know, the greater Waikato area, I think has some merit as well.  I'm interested in your thoughts around the three-step vaccination certification entry in talking with Hospitality New Zealand as part of that open dining conversation. It's challenging the cost of putting effectively a bouncer outside your establishment and whilst I know Hospitality New Zealand are challenging that and trying to  enhance a much quicker seamless accessibility. Got any thoughts on making that easier, reducing the cost, sharing the load in our town? Yeah, certainly Kelly.",

And so, you know, we're having some challenging advocacy around is that that is now the time to enforce that. And clearly it's not as businesses start to recover. So, you know, quite often we prod at the council, but for all the right reasons to,  just think outside of your square and into the broader business proposition. Most of the time we get a real willingness and buy-in and yeah it's all great but I ask everybody in the room if you're making a decision that might impact on business whether wherever that might be the one question what is the impact it's going to have  And, you know, we've got really good open communication with the chamber and council.

I've got to say, one of the things I probably didn't touch on, but we're seeing more and more, is that we need to get the younger people's lenses on  what we should be doing in our town centres. So we need to be thinking of our successive audiences.  In our organization, we've got a number of young people, and it's been fascinating. We've been doing a large consultation recently with businesses across an area where there's going to be some fairly significant changes in terms of transport corridor. And older businesses are very reluctant to see any change. Younger businesses,  are all for this and the younger businesses are going, you know, there's a huge trajectory for them. The older businesses are just really trying to cling on to what they've had and so, and I speak from an older point of view, so I think it's really important that we encourage our businesses to have very open thoughts and that we bring younger people into this conversation so that they can see that  what the needs and aspirations of our emerging audience is going to be, so that we continue to have that relevance and that we continue to, you know, yesterday's conversation with one of the staffers from Waip\u0101 District Council, you know, what's the reason that younger people are attracted to Waip\u0101?

But Kapiti is a very unique place in New Zealand right now, as it is about to see the opening of Transmission Gully, which is a generational road connection north and south of Kapiti.

Look, I don't have any great pearls of wisdom or actually questions for you, because I'm not a retailer or involved in hospitality, but I can tell you what I do do, and that is I buy lots of stuff.

So I guess as a person who's probably, as I say, making most of those decisions, is there any merit in focusing any particular attention to those primary decision makers? And secondly, finding out from those women with those checkbooks, what works best for them?  Because it's not really about the retailers, it's about the purchasers. It's about the people who are parting with their cash. And I guess I look around in Te Umuru in particular, in terms of that retail space. And we've got some excellent examples of shops that, retail outlets that migrated very quickly and very nimbly and created a really good platform for themselves in that retail space over COVID. And they continue to do so. And they ship  their products or their wares all over New Zealand as a result of it. So I wonder if there's any merit in actually finding out, approaching, looking down our main streets and finding out really excellent examples of places that were able to convince the women with the checkbooks to part with their money, because it's about the shopper's experience, isn't it? And the ease of that experience and find out what those motivators are  And aren't you best to look at the better examples rather than just sort of generically create campaigns that aren't targeted, I guess is what I'm trying to say.",

    "text": " Yeah, Susan, you're very right. And, you know, there's a common theme to all of those businesses you're talking about. I can picture them right now. And Lorraine's definitely picturing, because I think she went into many of those businesses and bought stuff. And so, you know, we still connect with those businesses because we see them on Facebook. Those are the ones that are talking to their customers. They're finding out what they want. They're understanding what the people that are shopping with them want.  and they are constantly adapting their offer and experience. The other thing is that they're letting people into their lives and they're showing what's going on in their shops on a regular basis. So they are connecting, we call it depth of connection. So people orientate towards those businesses because  there's a personal connection, there's empathy, and the fact that the people feel that they have a part in that business. And I think there's a lot of learnings from those, the ones that you're talking about, and I know exactly which ones they will be. Yeah, look, it's about knowing those triggers, isn't it?",

    "text": "And making sure those triggers are actually genuine and create a real sense of connection.  And yeah, I just sort of think if we undertake something that's a more targeted learning experience around the ones that are successful, you get bigger wins all around rather than just something that's generic from top down, it's better to look at the what we've actually got that's working. So yeah, and there are some fantastic shops and dare I say, in Te Umuru they're largely run by women, oddly enough.",

    "text": " That's exactly right what Chris is saying too about that depth of connection and when you're also talking Susan about that genuineness, it's like a birdcage when they're holding their big bunches of flowers and I mean even me here I see these big bunches of peonies or whatever it is at the time and you're you know whenever you're thinking flowers naturally my mind is going to there so I mean I'll still get things ordered through from her but it's  it's and then going back to the earlier question about that's how you're always then front and center so whenever you're needing whatever that particular item is or just because you need so you just need another another another shirt that's just a little bit different to the one you bought last week it's um you know it's it's always front and center  But it's also true for our experience when we were first up in Te Aamutu a few years ago, it was when we drove down the street really early in the morning and it's what that store actually physically looked like when everything else was dark. And there were just some fairy lights that were in that window. I mean, I know that there's a lot of stores like that now that all sell really beautiful things.  It's also just being, you know, what does it look like when lights are out? And you might not be at home on a tablet or a computer, but you've driven down that street after a meal, or it's just all those little touch points. It was actually that in the dark that made me want to go back and see that store. And, you know, there's still, you know, I still spend there now from a different city. So it's just all those, how do you really get into, like you say, that mindset?",

    "text": "Yeah, quickly. Chris, firstly, I want to thank you both for a great  a great presentation, I really, really enjoyed it. What I really want to say to you is that the hospitality industry has a huge role to play here. And I'm involved in that a little bit. And I find it very, very difficult at the moment, because we've been absolutely isolated the last six weeks, seven weeks, and it's going to be hard to get our customers back. But the hospitality promotion of that, I think, has got to be an integral part of what we do in promoting our town. Because if you have that industry operating well,  the rest of the town operates well. And I think that those little barriers that we've got, like the COVID passports, are going to cost us a lot of money. I'm emphasizing that please, please promote what you're doing there with the government, because I can see so many problems with that, particularly with the smaller hospitality outlets. And we do need something along that line to protect ourselves, because you have to have what we call a COVID Nazi or something  standing at the door saying whether you can come in or not. But look, honestly, thank you very much for your presentation. And as I say, I do promote that fact that the hospitality industry has an integral part to play.",

We might do a gentle edit of it to cut the volume down, but hopefully it'll inform a kind of further discussion around some of the other plans in play and initiatives that are going on.  So thank you very much, Lorraine and Chris. Sorry that you guys couldn't come up, but we're just emerging from our cocoon.",
