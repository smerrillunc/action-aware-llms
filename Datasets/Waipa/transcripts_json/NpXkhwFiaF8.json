I agree, though, that we just need a bit more information to to indicate that although we've spoken to these various groups, that it isn't going to be it's not set in concrete. So we are wanting people to come back with with their stories and the information that  potentially we don't know. So, I think that that's fine. And the other issue that are really, and I think it's already been covered in the introductory remarks from Debbie, is that we really need to make sure that the public are aware that this is a project that's long term and we're not looking to all of a sudden invest in this reserve with significant costs right in the middle of COVID. So,  Look, I fully support. Let's get the information so we are ready to go. But we just need to be really clear in our communications that this is a long term plan. We do want people's input into it and the funding of it. If we can get external funding, sure, we can start straight away. But immediately, there isn't a huge amount of money that's available to actually do a lot of the work. So,  don't automatically assume once the reserve management plan is approved that it will start building tomorrow.",

    "text": "Thanks for that Jim. Can I just say kia ora Hazel, thank you very much for your fascinating presentation and I have to say it particularly resonated with me in terms of the importance and value of women in society for obvious reasons and it was really enlightening for me I have to say.  clearing my ignorance here, I was not aware of Apakura's emphasis, if you like, on the importance of women in society. So that makes me feel quite happy that I'm from Te Aumutu. And Chrissy, thank you. I think it's really important to emphasise that this is a park that is something that is, or at least the vision anyway, is that it's transformative and it is long term.  And it's important also from the comments that the mayor has made that, you know, financially we have to be conscious of what this could actually cost. Currently it's not budgeted. So this is something that is somewhat aspirational in some manner of speaking, but we've got to carry on in the process. And it's important to, at this point, get this whole concept out, which I'm really comfortable with personally, but that's just my personal view as it currently stands, subject to being a little bit more  emphasis perhaps on some of the history in terms of the RSA aspects. However I think it's really important we do get that feedback from the community because clearly people are passionate about it. It's no secret about that if you happen to jump onto Facebook pages in connection with Te Omoja Grapevine. So look I'm really looking forward to  to finding out what people's views are around it. I know not everybody will agree, but I think the whole point is that we've got to start somewhere and kind of be brave. And this is certainly doing that. So thank you for your work, Chrissie and team. I think it's fantastic. Thank you, Hazel. And thank you, Lou, to RSA for their input so far. And I look forward to seeing what we come up with on the assumption that the recommendation appearing on page 80 is going to be approved today.  Have we done anything? Susan, could I just say something?",

I'm really excited by what is there and also the emphasis and importance on women as well. One of my big concerns, as you probably know, is the ability to actually reach out to the community and get their feedback at this time.  And I'm not convinced that doing it online will actually do an adequate job. Like, it's a really important exercise. You know, it's setting the scene, you know, for the main wing of Te Ururoa Matu and making that connection. And as we've heard from Marcus and other people, you know, there's so many memories in that space of land. So I'd like some, my initial assumption is that we've really got to extend the period so that  We're not reliant on online avenues, but I am open to hearing what Charlotte's got to say, you know, about how we could reach, you know, right across our demographic to make sure we get the feedback. I mean, here in Porongia, we're not getting newspapers delivered. So, you know, I don't know what the situation is in Te Umutu, but we can't just assume that people are going to hear about the consultation and it's just so critical that we do get the feedback.",

We actually put this together understanding that we may be moving across alert levels.  And so we do need to take a more creative approach to how we engage with our community. So we're looking at this from a three-pronged perspective. The first part of the consultation will be around developing a really great stakeholder database and developing those connections and contacting them directly. So we'll be doing letters, phone calls, emails, and actually tapping people on the shoulders to get their feedback.  and we'll also be doing a more traditional approach. So the papers are actually starting to print again now and at Alert Level 3 you will see them start to be dropped in your area. Councillor, thank you. So the Te Ao Mutu Courier is now in production again and are able to print and the Te Ao Mutu News, Cambridge News have combined and are available at the supermarket. So we do have that avenue again.  We also will be coupling that with a really strong digital campaign to get feedback through our normal channels and social media groups as well. And then the third aspect is actually targeting the users of this area, so the people who enjoy these public spaces. So we're going to be installing signage. We're going to be installing signage.  will have a really great board to introduce the project and what's proposed. And then there are going to be key points around the area which give some history and understanding of the importance of that area and then what we're proposing in terms of enhancements and how that will be improved.  So I'm pretty confident that this will spark many opportunities for people to provide their thoughts. And we've got a range of different touch points to reach people.",

Yeah, so when I had a look at the budget and I appreciate that, you know, funding is uncertain, like it'd be great if we did get external funding, you know, from the central government for it.  But I'd just like to highlight that I'm concerned about the amount that's been put in for the Manga Ahoi stream bridge, $250,000, with the note that there's been nothing included there for any sort of creative or decorative artwork for that bridge. And I'm pretty disappointed about that, actually, because I thought the whole idea was to create something that is  I suppose, from the community, you know, from people in the community about that bridge and what it represents as a memorial. And I know that we've had a lot of funding applications done to central government for what we call standard infrastructure, you know, which is keeping engineers and sort of other hard infrastructure consultants, you know, in business.  But where is the money for our creative community? You know, they are really important, you know, as I suppose, making up who we are. And I'd really like to see funding directly for that creative side of, I suppose, when we're creating what we call placemaking and things like that. And so I'm not happy that there hasn't been any allocation for that.  And I'd really like staff to try and work on that so that when we're trying to get funding for these projects, we're not just looking after the traditional consultants that we work with. We've also got to remember the other parts of our community.",

Yeah, so, OK. Well, we can definitely find out actually what the story is around that just to make sure that there is even distribution across the district.  but yeah I think in this case we our purpose is really to try and reach as many touch points as possible because we don't really have I guess all the facts and figures around which media people prefer to consume the most and this affects a wide variety of groups so we need to cover all bases so I would say that it would be a pretty well balanced campaign rather than focusing on particular tactics and channels",

So are we comfortable then as a committee that that reference to six weeks on page 80  five can actually, in our minds, be acknowledged as eight weeks, which will allow us a little bit more time, hopefully enable us to have better consultation, but still provide us with the ability to move on should we be fortunate enough to attract CIP funding for those community facilities.  Are you comfortable with that? Absolutely. Okay.

So on this one, I'll be co-presenting together with two clerks, who's here on behalf of our mana whenua partners, Ngati Hoa and Ngati Koa Kikuhukura today.  So as for the engagement process and the sort of path to this concept plan, with the draft plan for Lake Tikutu, we've also gone through an extensive engagement phase with our mana whenua partners who have played an integral part in co-designing. And we've also received feedback and additional information from all four leases at the site. So that's the Society of Arts, the Records Club,  the Bowling Club and the Girl Guides, as well as the Cambridge Community Board. Again, the community through CRMs that we as staff have received throughout the last few years, and this committee. And we've also reviewed numerous reports that have been done, especially in relation to the water quality, and that review has also been included.  Yeah, so all of that, as I said, has informed this draft concept plan at hand. And at this point, I would like to hand over to Clark. So Sam, if you can go on to the next page, please.

Te Koot\u016b is a place for all people.  enter, enjoy and be welcome. I'd like to express my gratitude to the mayor and the council for hearing our presentation for this concept plan. You will be supplied with a fair bit of supporting documentation on this presentation. My intention is not to give you the entire presentation before you, but to give our perspective as mana whenua to the concept plan for Lake Te Kootu.  The Eastern Mana Whenua Gateway that is envisaged to be a waharoa. A waharoa is an entrance gateway that can show the cultural influence of the iwi associated with Lake Te Kootu. It enables the stories of mana whenua to be told, but also provides a cultural symbolism to be told. The Marahupara Playground and Meeting Place. A marahupara is a series of  interconnecting logs to be climbed on, walked along, and used by all life forms. Fallen trees and native wetlands and forests were a haven for play throughout the centuries. They were used as footpaths, access ways, climbed over, used in play as props for forts, even utilized as meeting places for people of all ages. A natural playground, marahupara,  gives a more cultural perspective to play. It encourages natural confidence building in play. The concept plan intended to focus recommendations on options that provide the most sustainable outcomes over both short and long term. As for the lake itself, water quality is an important aspect. The water quality of Lake Te Kootu has been degraded significantly by the inputs from catchments surrounding it.  The report's recommendations focus on options providing the most sustainable outcomes over both a short and long-term period, with emphasis on solutions that act to reduce long-term contaminant build-ups and inputs into the lake. Without improvement of stormwater treatment in the Lake England Reserve, options in isolation are unlikely to achieve measurable improvements to water quality.  Therefore, stormwater management should adopt a systems approach with treatment options implemented when and where possible as part of new capsule works programs or as part of general operational and maintenance work.  undertaking stormwater improvement work as add-ons, such as as part of our wider projects, such as roading, plumbing or stormwater system upgrades is an option that other local authorities are starting to consider more widely. Critical factors for improving water quality of Lake Te Kootu is treatment of the stormwater before it gets to the lake.  so that any other flow of water going out to the Awa Waikato is in the best condition as possible. Options are limited at the stormwater inflow points into the lake due to the restricted access and narrow space around the lake perimeter. However, the space within the lake offers an opportunity to implement  water quality treatment measures which can be closely aligned to landscape and amenity objectives for lakes to call to, such as lake edge plantings, lake outpour planting and western wetland. You'll see that western wetland is being a little bit hard to describe on the left hand side of that particular map that you're looking at at the moment.  Wetlands and edge plantings have been planned to cool any stormwater ingress into the lake, because obviously we know that during the summer months, any water coming into the lake can sometimes be quite a temperature. The wetland also helps to filter out many contaminants, in addition to lowering the temperature of the stormwater from the hot roads and surrounding areas.  and capture sediment in a natural, passive, low-maintenance ecological system. Plantings to encourage native wildlife, providing marakai for native birds as in food resources, kainga k\u014dhanga for bats and native species for nesting, wetland plantings to improve water quality and water life, thereby enhancing biodiversity.  This plan is in collaboration with experts and interested parties from the council staff, the community and mana whenua. As such, the plan aims to strengthen the connections between Te Kootu, the Cambridge community, mana whenua and all visitors.  T\u0113n\u0101 koutou, t\u0113n\u0101 koutou katoa.

    "text": " Thank you so much, too. So last year, and Debbie sort of mentioned that in her introduction, through the Cambridgetown concept plan refreshed, we asked the Cambridge resident what was most important to them for the future of Cambridge. And they told us that improving the natural health of the lake and telling its history was a top priority. So similar to the Memorial Park draft concept plan, the aim was really to develop a long-term vision and to be bold.  Before I continue, I would just like to point out that we've had to make one minor correction to the key features plan that you see in front of you right now and that you've got in your reports. The number 30, which is the lake outflow structure, is falsely located on this plan in front of you within the wetland area. But in fact, it should actually be located between  the play area on the bottom terrace and the proposed meeting place. So continuing on, so as two outlined, the aim of the draft plan is really to acknowledge the historical and cultural significance of the site to enhance water quality and biodiversity with the important connection down to the Carpio Stream and also the Waikato River.  and for the Cambridge community, but also for visitors to be able to connect to the lake, to play, to recreate in the midst of Cambridge, a space where our community can really learn about the ecology, the history, and also the challenges associated with an urban lake environment, where they can meet and play and or simply go for a walk or relax. So with that, I would like to conclude our presentation. Thank you.",

Look, a great presentation. Thank you, too. I just need to say for people that haven't been on the council, this is a third report that I have seen concluded on Lake Tikahutu. And really, this one doesn't add a heck of a lot, because going along with that water quality for me has always been able to find an option of putting more water in the lake. And I took a little bit of offense to  a piece in here that said viability of and reasoning behind the water option is dubious. And when you've got local people that have got ideas, sometimes those dubious things come into fruition and it can help. So, I'm not too sure on the Lake needing three million litres of water a day.  But I do concur that it could be quite expensive if we were able to find another location. There's currently a couple in the pipeline that people are talking to Jim and I about.  What I wanted to do with those two little C and D recommendations yesterday was to try and get a buy-in of everybody, including Iwi and the Waikato River Authority and the Regional Council, so that we could all go forward with this and hopefully get a heap of ideas and funding, which would go to help what is going to be happening at  at the lake because I think it's a it's something that's appreciated by everybody that comes to Cambridge now it was a hidden it was hidden away for a long time and at this stage I felt that it was bigger than the Waip\u0101 rate payers and that buy-in might be just the the thing that we need to go forward with it.

    "text": " Yes. Thank you, Councillor Rican. I just there's a few things I wanted to just bring up. One is that mana whenua haven't yet actually met about the concept of adding such a volume of water into Lake Te Kootu. Now,  We have actually discussed things like the fact that it is so shallow and that over a long period of time, it has built up a lot of sediment. Adding 3 million litres to begin with does one of two things. Either it raises the level of the lake, which would not really be a good thing because  it is already many of the structures that are around the lake and access around the lake is almost down to the level of the current level of the water anyway which means that you'd be looking at removing a lot of that sludge in order to increase the capacity of Lake Te Kootu. Now that in itself kind of like  for me anyway, reads a number of issues, which includes the disturbance of everything in the lake because of all the particle disturbance from the removal of sludge. It also brings to question  When you do remove that sludge, how do you address the drainage of such sludge? And how is that left to drain back into the wetlands or what happens? And also, where does it go to, the sludge itself, once you finish with it? Another point that I really wanted to raise was about  where the water comes from, I find it... I'll start again. As an example,  There was an open cast mine in Huntly that was closed down and the rehabilitation of that was to let it fill to become a lake, Puketirini, in Huntly West.  that was basically filled naturally. And that's a lake that is about 54 hectares in area and about 60 something meters in depth. And it's used as, it's used by a diving school because of its extreme depth. Now, that was basically filled up over the seasons of natural rainfall.  I would see that if the lake itself was was voided off by much of the sludge, that that would probably, in my opinion, be the simplest way of allowing it to refill.  I do have a lot of other things, but I think that for the moment, those are my main points that I wanted to raise, particularly about having mana whenua also and some consultation around that, because changing the lake in that order, to me, changes the mauri of the lake. And that requires serious consideration from mana whenua on that particular aspect.  I know.",

So again, and I think that's part of the staff comments we brought back to Councillors yesterday is  that the consultants we've been working on, and when I say consultants, that doesn't just include landscape architects, but also ecologists and water engineers. So, and definitely acknowledge, as Councillor Webber said, that there have been a number of reports in the past.  And I think the key thing with this one is that it does actually really provide a way forward. And I do also acknowledge that there might be differences in opinion, but I think I feel very comfortable with the suggestions that our consultants have made, because they have really reviewed all the different aspects that, for example, that GHD report that was done previously has suggested.  Adding to, yeah, we do need, and I think the recommendation sort of outlines that as well, we do need to really closely work with Mana When considering, yeah, any sorts of works with the water. We have also had initial conversations with the Waikato Regional Council and what I can feedback from that. And we have made some amendments to the ecology report and stormwater report as well as the  Um, and, and, and, um, the, the, the, um, draft concept plan following that engagement with, um, counsel.

So, one of the things I think that the extension of consultation is crucially important, because the report that we've got now, we really need people, and there's a lot of experts in Cambridge, I've found out over the last...  a wide variety of them, but they need time to process this report, and perhaps, you know, I just think it needs to be a bit more widely circulated, because there's nothing like facts and there's nothing like proper information to educate us all about what the story actually is. So, yeah, I'll just agree with the recommendation as well, agree with your comments, Glen,  And thank you, Trudie, for your affirmation.

    "text": "Just wanted to say kia ora too. I really appreciated what you said. The additional water from my point of view  was going to be particularly pertinent in the summertime when it becomes quite tepid. And that doesn't do a lot for the water quality. So, that was part of it. But going back a decade, the original report we had, we had a couple of guys in a dinghy and they measured it right through and it's got an average depth of about one and a half metres, but it's got in excess of half a metre of sludge. Now, the advice from the regional council was  that if we took the sludge out at that time, a cost of two million dollars, it needed to go to be burnt at a furnace. Now, that was an impossible cost at that time, and I'm sure that it hasn't got any cheaper. When we said that there was no way that we could afford to do that, the regional council suggested that we put in a coating of alum to lock in that sludge on the lake.  So, that's just some of the background to that. In terms of Liz's comments about people having some good ideas, she's absolutely right. And in terms of the protocol on getting water there, I'm sure that at some stage we could work with Iwi and get that for the betterment of the lake. But the people that are talking to Liz and I and Jim at the moment are in that engineering  or have been in that engineering and working costs and things, and they really need to be listened to. So going out for a wider audience, like Liz says, is absolutely got to happen. Yeah, thank you.",

And look, like everybody else, been around a long time and this issue has come up regularly over 30 years that I'm aware of and probably before then as well.  And it's always fallen over because of a funding issue, really, rather than anything else. And a lot of it's been based on the two issues that we've been talking about, is the sludge and additional water for the lake. But if the opinion is now that the sludge can be left where it is, and whether it's locked in, Graham, or not, I'm not sure, in terms of adding alum or to the lake.  But, and if there is sufficient water without us finding anything from further afield, and that's accepted as the best option, then a lot of our, I suppose, costs that have stopped it going ahead in the past have gone. So, look, the feeling I get with all of the meetings that I've attended around Cambridge is that there is a willingness now for the community to pay for the,  for the upgrade of this lake. So, if we can manage it by controlling the stormwater inlets that we've got there now and then doing the works we're talking about, then we've probably got a solution that's affordable and we can move forward on. So, look, I think we absolutely need to listen to people and there's some great ideas out there and ask two farmers for a solution and you'll get at least two different ideas.  Graham's absolutely right. There's people out there wanting to pump water from all over the district to solve the problem. And certainly a huge quantity of water rushing through the lake would clean it out. But that's probably not what we want to achieve at the moment. So,  look, I'm fully in support of the recommendation with Graeme's addition so that we can actually get on and get people's points of view and actually do something there rather than just file another report in the dungeons of Council and not do anything with it.

    "text": " Kia ora koutou. I'm really fortunate to follow on from my matua Tu who did a wonderful mihi and so I just support all of the acknowledgements that he made in his mihi earlier. So my role really is to, I know our time is very short today, but my role is to try and set the scene around the Reserve Management Plan that we're putting before you to give you a bit of background about who Ng\u0101ti Koroki Kahukura is.  why we formed the reference group and just some comments around the vision and the reasons why we wanted a shift in the focus of the plan going forward. So at this point, Anna and I are going to go back and forwards, I think, a little bit in terms of the presentation. So just on this slide, I'm going to take the opportunity to do a little theme setting around who Ngati Koroki Kahukura  is. Whilst the maunga has a very rich human history, the Crown has acknowledged in our settlement that Ng\u0101ti Koroki Kahukura are the iwi with dominant mana whenua interests, rights and interests in respect of the maunga. And we fought for that in our treaty settlement and it's actually something that we live. It's not just words on a settlement page.  We continue to be a strong supporter of the restoration project on the mountain. We've raised, as an iwi, close to a million dollars, actually, through our external relationships to assist with the ongoing work of the MEIT project. We underwrote Sirocco's very first visit, which turned out to be a huge success. One of our tribal members has gifted land to the project, which has become known as the Tautari Wetland.  We have a lot of lands, privately owned lands, within the Maunga project. We have been integral in creating and maintaining inter-iwi relationships with other iwi who give species to the project, which has been critical to the project's success. And of course, we still have the participation of the current co-chair, Poto Davies, and many other  members and representatives over the years. So just in terms of the Treaty Settlement, we reached our own Treaty Settlement on behalf of Ng\u0101ti Koroki-Kahukura in 2012 with the Crown. And the legislation that completed the settlement was passed in 2014. And there are a number of references to that legislation in the draft plan.  In addition to our support that I referred to just earlier, as part of our settlement we also sought an advance of funds from the Treaty Settlement so that we could contribute one third of the purchase price of the Visitor Centre, Manutioriori, when the opportunity arose to purchase that property.  We have made a commitment to continue working with MEIT and the council to protect the integrity and security of the fence and achieved some money through our settlement to assist with that.  And another key feature of the settlement is that it establishes Te Hapori o Maungatautari, which in a nutshell is the symbolic owner of the reserve land in Maungatautari and replaced Queen Elizabeth II on the title as the owner.  Te H\u0101pori o Maungatautari includes Ng\u0101ti Koroki-Kahukura as well as Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101, Waikato-Tainui, Raukawa and the community of Maungatautari represented by Waip\u0101mea. Although the Crown retains the rights and responsibilities of the holder of the fee simple estate in the reserve lands, there may be times when a transaction needs to occur involving Te H\u0101pori o Maungatautari  And if that happens, then a decision is valid if the mayor and three of the iwi named in the settlement agree. I just want to point out here that this was not the redress of choice for Ng\u0101ti Koroki-Kahukura. We preferred that our reserve lands be returned to us and vested in an ancestor of Ng\u0101ti Koroki-Kahukura or that the mountain be afforded its own legal personality. But that was, those options were declined.  by the Crown. Te H\u0101pori o Maungatautari is not a legal entity, it's not a co-governance body either. The governance and management arrangements of the maunga remain unaffected by the settlement. The settlement triggered a review of the reserve management plan that was to be conducted by ourselves, Ng\u0101ti Koroki Kahukura and the Waipaha District Council and as Anna has said, we created  or formed a reference group to assist in that process and over the many years that this process has been going on we've seen a rotation of staff and a number of different people helping on behalf of the council so I acknowledge Anna's acknowledgement of the patience of Ngati Koroki Kahukura in going through this process  Why did we think that our settlement trigger a review of the plan? We felt that a review would provide an opportunity for a clearer and more forward-thinking reserve management plan. And we're going to talk about the features of the plan throughout the rest of this presentation. So, I think, can we go to the next slide? I can't remember if it's me next or Anna carries on.",

    "text": "I'll carry on, Linda.  As Linda's noted, it has been quite a long process to develop the draft plan, started before my time at Waip\u0101. In 2016, we notified our intent to review the plan, and we received 50 submissions, and they're summarized for you in appendix two of the report. Following that, last year, we appointed Becker to progress the plan, and they reviewed these submissions, undertook research into best practice,  and did a significant amount of engagement with Raukawa, Ngati Haua, Waikato-Tainui, DOC, the Regional Council, MEIT, and the Maungatautari Reserves Committee to draft the plan with the reference group. And I'd like at this point just to acknowledge the efforts of Emily Orton from BECCA, who has since moved on to another organisation, but prepared the draft plan and the report. In February, the Maungatautari Reserves Committee endorsed the draft plan, included in Appendix 1,  to be brought to council to be approved for public consultation, which is what we're up to today. Next slide, please. Just before we get into the, I guess, the changes of the plan, just to talk about the scope of the plan. So here we've got a map that shows the full extent of Sanctuary Mountain, with the red line being the 47 kilometers of predatory fencing.  You can see the southern enclosure in the purple, the northern enclosure in the pink and the tracks that go across the maunga and also the visitor centre there at the south. You also see overlays that are in the district plan to protect the values of the maunga and also the two marae that are in close proximity. Next slide please. So the management plan  only looks at and only covers the scenic reserve within Sanctuary Mountain. So that's the light blue and that's about 2,500 hectares. So it's about three quarters of the total area. Next slide please. I'm sure many of you are quite familiar with management plans and their importance. They are required by the Reserves Act and they're really important documents to set the vision and direction for managing reserves.  As you'll see in this document, in this diagram, we've tried to just identify everything that influences management plans and everything that then the management plan will influence. So that's a, I'll just give you a moment just to digest that. I would just note that a really important document for us to develop with Mana Whenua and the community and our partners  to see that vision and provide that framework for making decisions going forward. Next slide, please.",

    "text": "So I think it's back to me now. I'm talking about the proposed vision. But before I do that, thanks, Anna, for acknowledging Emily. I'd also like to acknowledge Demelza Murphy, who helped at the beginning of this process and did quite a lot of the early drafting. We did that together.  and she moved on to a different role as well. And you would have seen on the screen, on the maps, the two marae being P\u014dhara and Maungatautari. Those are the two active marae of Ng\u0101ti Koroki Kahukura. And the final slide where it had private land holdings  I just really want to make the point again that a number of those private land holdings are M\u0101ori owned land. So not only do we have an interest in terms of the reserve lands, but we are private landowners as well. In terms of the vision, these particular words, He taonga tuku iho a maungatautari, He whenua taurikura, He pai haumako, He kura tangihia mo te m\u0101t\u0101muri,  Those are words taken from a famous lament of King T\u0101whiao, and it's that same lament that was used to create the vision for the Waikato River Authority. And basically, if you imagine the king looking back over his lands as he was about to be exiled into what became known as the king country,  he looked at what he considered to be a paradise. And so we wanted to create a vision of the paradise that Maungatautari is. It's a living treasure, a place where our cultural and natural history are respected, enjoyed and enhanced, where people work together as guardians of this legacy for generations.  And I think one of the key shifts in focus from the previous Reserve Management Plan to what's currently being proposed is that to try and move away from just a document that sets out rules and regulations for decision makers, but actually explaining why there are those rules and regulations.  and to shift the focus of the plan to being actually on the mountain itself. And so that's why we've provided a lot of background information to explain why the plan proposes guidance that it does in relation to how the maunga  is accessed and treated, partly so that mana whenua are not seen as barriers to the use of the maunga, but as protectors of the maunga as a taonga and a gift left to us by our ancestors. So next slide, please. So I think I've covered that in that last part.",

    "text": " So this is a large part of the body of the plan, are the objectives and policies. And a number of these are very similar to those that are in the current plan, particularly in relation to ecological restoration, view shafts, visitor infrastructure, and research and education. But there are some key differences, and I think it does all stem back to what Linda's talking about in terms of really emphasizing the why and trying to get people to connect to that.  and understand it, and therefore, I guess, supports the way that we're determining it's best to manage this taonga. So the main differences from the existing plan to this one that I see is that there's quite a focus on the creation of appropriate and respectful governance and partnerships. There's definitely the recognition of the importance of volunteers and how we can grow and support our community to be connected to the maunga through volunteering.  There's an acknowledgement of the importance of tikanga and matauranga M\u0101ori and enabling mana whenua to have a living and enduring presence on the maunga. It confirms that there's a commitment to work with the adjacent landowners to progress access agreements and covenants related to the fence, and also where possible to support the owner of the fence, MEIT, to maintain its functional integrity.  The plan does go into more detail about the nature of outdoor experiences that will be developed and encouraged, and also provides some more clarity around the types of activities that are not supported on the maunga. And we have also set out matters to be considered and covered in the annual operation plans and annual reports, just to give greater clarity and transparency to that process.  You'll see when you read those that we haven't set out who is doing the action. The assumption, and we might need to clarify that in the plan, is that where there is an action-oriented policy, that that is council that's undertaking that, although that might be through the contractor who is MEIT at the moment. Next slide, please. So,  This is the last slide. If today you are supportive of us starting the public consultation process, we will look to start that on the 25th of May. And just taking, I guess, what was said with the earlier two items, we'd be looking to extend that beyond the required two months, probably to 10 weeks for that consultation to, I guess, recognize the challenges associated with impacts of COVID-19.  We're also working closely with the comms team to look at all the ways that we can actively promote the plan and ensure it does get out to everyone and that we hear from everyone. So there will be emails and letters going out to all previous submitters, to mana whenua, to key stakeholders. We'll be having a large social media presence. We'll have public notices which are required in the papers. At level two, libraries and the offices will be open and we'll have draft copies of the plan there for viewing.  We will be encouraging people to use an online survey form, but of course we will also receive hard copies and submissions by phone are also possible. Following that submission period, there'll be the preparation of the hearings report, and then there'll be a hearings. And in this report, we're seeking a resolution to appoint two independent hearing commissioners to hear and recommend to council any amendments to the draft plan prior to adoption.  And then the final step in all of that is once council has approved the plan, that we will then send it through to the Minister of Conservation for the approval that's required under the Reserves Act. So that concludes our presentation. Thanks, Linda, and thank you all for listening. I'm very happy to answer any questions. Can I just say first, though, Anna, that we have noticed a few minor typographical",

Look, I really acknowledge the breadth and the depth of work that's been done in this Reserve Management Plan review. It's really impressive. And I welcome, actually, the shift in the thinking, because I think it's really important to explain why, and not simply because it's just important to know, but it actually improves and understands and can lead to greater understanding and buy-in and uptake of what you're trying to do there.  And that's, I mean, it's, you're kind of banging your head against a brick wall if you just keep smacking the whole rules, regulations, this is what we're doing. It's important to get behind that and go deeper and explain the why. So I welcome that and thank you for your work in that space.

    "text": "Yeah. Thanks, Susan. And congratulations here to the team that's worked on this because, yeah, it is a good read. I'm pleased that  some typical areas were picked up. Did you notice on the map that Mangatauturi, Marae is spelt incorrectly? Great. Yeah. So my big question was actually around who's responsible for which functions, which Anna has alluded to. Yeah. And yeah, it wasn't clear at all when you had a look at those lists of policies, who would be implementing them and who had responsibility for them. And I think it's really important  that is really made pretty obvious. And I think from what Anna's said, there'll be a range of people or bodies that actually come together to do those things, which I think is great. It sounds like a collaboration and that would be fantastic. So I really endorse that. And then I had another question about the funding. It's under the ecological diversity section, I think.  because I'm just really conscious that it could be interpreted that Council is actually committing to fund the integrity of the offence, whether that be operational or replacing it. And I'm just concerned with what message that might send and whether or not by having it in the Reserve Management Plan, that expectations might be created, particularly with  various stakeholders, that council has got a bottom line there. And if others don't fund it, then council definitely will. So I'd really like to have that, I suppose, expressed in a way that perhaps says it would be a best endeavours or we're working on this together and we're going to try and do whatever we can to make it work. But it's not actually a firm commitment from council.  And then the last thing I had was in the recommendation, E talks about appointing an independent commissioner, but the previous clause talks about two commissioners. So I just think a little correction is needed in that E for multiple commissioners. Thanks.",

We, in the explanation, we do talk about if possible, but happy to review that wording to look at whether we need to, yeah, I guess, express clearly the intent behind that policy.",

So you need a very clear line about who's going to be doing what. Yeah, and I think there could be could have been a lot better  marrying of the documents that MEIT has with this, because there's a lot of stuff that's covered in MEIT that's not here, and I think it would make the document look a lot better and stronger. For instance, there's not a big play in this document about the huge international and national and regional importance of Maungatautari and the hierarchy it has in the world of being the biggest sanctuary, fence-proof, pest-proof sanctuary in the world.  and it's a k\u014dkako, maybe a k\u014dkako haven soon and it's going to be the k\u014dhanga reo for all the k\u014dhanga for all the native species that are endangered across New Zealand.

And so what we've done is, yeah, we've set out some policies and objectives, but we've right up front really emphasised that the mountain is a taonga. And I take on board Poto's comments about the international importance as well.  but so for example we have lots and lots of requests to use the mountain for wedding receptions, for glamping, for mountain biking, all sorts of things and so we rather than prescribing and going through no you can't do this, no you can't do that, we thought we would focus on the taonga  nature of the mountain and then set out some policies and objectives that give guidance. So you know I think we think very carefully about particularly the taking of logs off the mountain but there might be might be a could be you know a possibility that someone might want to do something with a fallen native tree or something like that.",

So, I'm going to go ahead and get started.  I'm conscious of time and that you've been running a little bit over, so I'll try and get through this reasonably quickly. So firstly, this is the quarterly district growth report. It's quite a detailed document, as you can see, but provides a snapshot of the growth and regulatory services during that period of 1 January of this year through to 31 March. So the structure of the quarterly report provides information to your rising, both at the national, regional and local levels.  There's no decision making required here. It's for this committee. It's only for your information purposes only. Part three of the report details a number of documents that's been released by central government for public submission and the council submitted on these documents. The submissions are attached as appendix seven. Not all of those submissions are related to growth, but they're being included for completeness purposes.  As I'd indicated, our manager of strategy, Kirsty, will talk a little bit more about this and discuss the submissions lodged and also the work done at a regional level as well. I'll just turn to item five of the agenda. So that provides an update on the strategic planning work undertaken at the local level.  So in particular, we've got updates there on the structure plans for the various growth cells that have been provided. And so really want to sort of reinforce and reiterate that we reached a good milestone last week with the three Ms relating to Cambridge C2, C3 intersection treatment. So the agreement that we reached was without the need for peer review,  was to provide for a single lane roundabout with a north-south and east-west pedestrian cycle underpass. So that design work for the intersection treatment will now be initiated and affected stakeholders will be advised. We do need to secure  and future proof that intersection treatment for four-laning. So any land acquisition would need to be for a, sorry, two-lane roundabout, not a four-lane roundabout, a two-lane roundabout. Also, just while I'm on the C2 area, so we've got design work being completed for the major infrastructure, collective roads and stormwater swales and water supply.  We're also working, still working with the St Peter's team to secure the stormwater easements for the corridor. I know this property has been on the market for a little bit, and we've been dealing with a number of prospective purchases. But we're back now with St Peter's team and the new board chair, and we're working with them to secure the stormwater easements for the corridor. We're also working with the St Peter's team to secure the stormwater easements for the corridor.  And so we're still working with them to secure that. In relation to the discharge consents for C2, C3, we have provided final comments to WRC on that consent. That went to them yesterday on the conditions and we're expecting some final feedback from them next week. 3Ms have also lodged the submission for the creation of the lots, the development potential lots for public purposes. So 10 lots, so those are the main corridors for public purposes that collect the roads  the stormwater swales and reserves. So we're well advanced in terms of preliminary work for the designs and securing stormwater discharges and easements to facilitate further development for the C2 area. The C1 area, we're doing the design for the intersection. So the C1,  obviously opposite on Victoria Road, opposite Norfolk Drive. We are getting the expression of interest for the intersection design done on that. And we still have foodstuffs indicating their desire to establish a supermarket in the C1 location. So we'll continue to work closely with that. We'll get the intersection design done with the Norfolk Drive.  and that will facilitate access into C1 to allow for that development to occur. We're also securing the land purchases on the northern, we have secured the land purchases for the northern area, northern edge of Cambridge North for the swale systems, now connected into the stormwater retention pond. We're still working on securing the stormwater discharge point to the Mangione Stream to the north by Hautapu to facilitate stormwater out to, for Cambridge North.  So just a few snapshots here in relation to development in Cambridge North, C1, 2, and 3. I do note in the report, and unfortunately I just sort of picked up on it on page 12, we do have some of the numbering wrong on the C5 to 11. I think it's just a bit of a typo there.  Turning to item six, the details for district planning, development, implementation. So given recent reprioritization requirements, we'll provide the committee a separate report at the next month's meeting on the district plan changes. So I'll perhaps just leave that there. The next item on the agenda is a report on the growth cells and the status update. So I'm going to turn to item six,  Further on item six, we provide information on resource consents and building consents. And interesting for the committee's feedback, we've been monitoring building consent applications in the last two weeks, and they are getting back to normal, around 30 applications a week. Inspection work for building consents has commenced last week, and they've been  been a steady stream of inspection booking as the week's progressed, as builders return to work under alert level three. So inspection work, we may be fully back to normal in the next week. So that just gives you an indication that there's still a lot of work going on in that space. And I understand talking to my consents team leader that resource consent applications are steady. So there's no pattern of decline at the moment.  Just of some significant developments that I can share of particular note, we've got building consents in for a trade depot warehouse office and offices. That's a 34,000 square meter floor area building valued at $24 million. That's going to be located at Sharp Road next to Torpedo 7 warehouse trade depot. We've got a new medical center practice and other tendencies  Cambridge Road, that's the Chartwell Investments site, $1.6 million development. So these are developers progressing their building consents post, well, you know, in the current environment. So, you know, there's a lot going on. There's a lot going on in the community. There's a lot going on in the community. There's a lot going on in the community.  And there are other significant developments, both Te Amuru and Cambridge, that we're working on with those developers in pre-application stage. Section seven of the report deals with monitoring and enforcement statistics. And I'm not going to go through any great detail. Carl's there to answer any questions in relation to that. We have maintained our after hours noise monitoring  services, although we haven't been going on premises during level four alert, seizing equipment, but allied security has provided a level of service and we continue to provide a level of afternoons monitoring service. And also with animal control, we have continued to provide responses to urgent dog incidents. So all the appendices are attached to the report.  with the recommendation that the report be received. But perhaps I'll just hand over to Kirsty if she's available just to comment any more in relation to sections four, three and four of the report.",

    "text": "Madam Chair, Your Worship and members of the committee. So just with regard to the documentation that has come out of central government, we've previously spoken about the flurry of documents for public submission that arrived on our desk  through December and January. And whilst we endeavour to engage with you before developing those submission responses, that hasn't always been the case in terms of workshopping and or formal endorsement at meetings. So we've had to adopt workarounds. In terms of the submissions there that are recorded, so the strategy team  collates all of those. And this is a record as to what's being submitted across the whole of the organisation, but that the work may be led out of subject teams or activity areas themselves. So in terms of those, there are a number in terms of legislation. There are some that are steps. So for example, in the water services area, there will be further legislation that will be coming out from central government for submission.  In terms of the national policy statement on biodiversity, there was an earlier discussion document that was circulated and that we inputted into also. So, we have endeavoured to engage with elected members. So, for example, on the MPS and RMA, we did have input from Councillor St Pierre and Councillor O'Regan specifically.  And we've also provided to you draft submissions through the Friday mail-out and requested feedback where we haven't been able to workshop or present to you an informal meeting. At a sub-regional level, in terms of future proof, so what has taken priority there is the work that's progressing on the Hamilton Waikato Metro Spatial Plan. And the intention was that there would be a first draft of that document completed by the end of this financial year.  Obviously, COVID-19 has had an impact, and that timeframe is now recognised as possibly being unrealistic, but there is work underway. David Topman is in another meeting at the same time as appearing here on the Metro Spatial Plan. There are a number of studies also being coordinated through FutureProof, so the Subregional Three Waters Study, the Housing Preference Study, and which are currently underway.  also the industrial land survey that has been completed. With regards to what is happening at a local level, we've had a number of documents that have been open for public engagement, community engagement. So, council has endorsed the structure plans for T6 and T11. With regard to the village concept plan for  we were going to be coming to you and requesting approval to engage with the community. That has been deferred in light of COVID-19, but we will be looking at commencing that process when we move through the alert levels. And in respect of Pirongia Town Concept Plan refresh, there is a public engagement process currently underway. We are looking at how we can enhance that community engagement process  to enable greater participation and in all likelihood, the timeframe for that may be extended. In accordance with the direction from elected members, no community engagement processes will come to an end whilst we're in lockdown. They will remain open until such time as council offices reopen. As with Wayne, I'm happy to take any questions.",

So look, I don't know the detailed answer on that one.  It is a question that has been raised, as I say, by other commentators, and I'd imagine it will be just tested about what this new panel headed by the Environment Court judge and others and the types of projects that they will consider and determine and how significant will those projects will be. They'll have to be reasonably significant, otherwise they're going to be inundated on  on projects that they're going to have to make decisions on.

And I'm just wondering, is there any way that we can, you know, we can, you know,  either survey or find out from the builders, is this just a carry forward of commitments that were already made sort of a couple of months ago? And have they got a good a good booking of work leading out into the future? Because certainly one of the areas where I think we should be looking at in terms of trying to assist the community recovering is making sure that we've got a good  a good raft of building projects underway. But if all of our builders in the district are fully employed,  then that might be an area that we don't have to focus on and we can put our attentions elsewhere. So, yeah, I suppose the question is, yep, we're back on track at the moment. They're busy. Is that likely to carry on towards Christmas or do they think sort of house builds when people start feeling the impact of potentially losing losing jobs will actually fall away?
