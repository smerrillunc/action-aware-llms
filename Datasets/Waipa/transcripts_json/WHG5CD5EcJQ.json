Are there any disclosures of members' interest for item three? There are none. So we're on to item four, which is late items. Does anyone have any late items they wish to bring up? No late items. Confirmation of the order of the meeting, item five. Can I have a mover?  Graham and seconded Philip. All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Contrary, carried. And now we go on to the minutes of the confirmation of the order of them, of confirmation of the minutes, sorry. Can I have a mover and seconder to receive those?  Everyone's waving Andrew, and who was the seconder? Oh, Philip. All those in favour? Aye. Contrary? Carried. So if we go through those minutes, page by page, page one, two, three,  four, five, six, and we would have all got a note this morning from Debbie, I presume, about the Macron. There's some more work being done on that. So, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,  And 12. So everyone's comfortable with those? I have a mover and seconder. Correct record, Lou, Brown and Marcus.

    "text": " Good morning, everybody. I'll take the report itself as read. As Gary's outlined, the Dog Control Act does allow these agreements between councils to effectively share staff. And when you're bordering another council, there are certainly instances where that can be advantageous.  Hamilton City approached us before the COVID lockdown was a thing, so it was something that was working its way through the pipeline. Hamilton have existing agreements with Waikato District to their north, and they're looking at agreements with Tauranga and other councils in the general area that are of a similar size and nature to them.  Some councils have this ability to enter into an agreement delegated and others don't. So we're in the position where that's not delegated. Hence the report to you today.  The staff basically see this as a common sense approach. We certainly have had instances in the past where a dog has crossed from Hamilton, committed an offence in our district. And in one case, I can remember it literally jumped the fence back into Hamilton. We then had to wait for Hamilton staff to respond from their side in order to resolve that. So some good practicalities there. The actual details we still need to work through. Obviously, a lot of this work's sort of gone on hold in the last couple of weeks.  If there was ever an example of a time where something like this might be useful, I guess this is probably it. So, yeah, happy to take any questions.

So, yeah, so look, yeah, so what this does, and yes, my apologies as well for the size of the agenda, but obviously these are quite complex legal documents, and yeah, they did need to be published in full. But essentially what these are doing is giving effect to a whole bunch of changes, I suppose,  that were actually agreed to resolved at the LGFA's annual general meeting a year ago. So yeah, so look, it's pretty straightforward in that regard.  And I say these just give basis to that. The very key change that these things are giving effect to is the ability for council-controlled organisations, CCOs, to be actually able to access LGFA funding as well. The LGFA has been a very, very successful mechanism for local authority.  funding in terms of the costs of that funding being significantly reduced on what it would otherwise have been. Very, very effective in that regard. So just looking to extend that out to the CCOs. But what that has required is a number of changes to the relevant documentation.  I think it's important to point out, actually the report does point this out, is that Council has not had any specific legal advice in regard to these documents. What we are relying on is that two quite prestigious legal firms have both reviewed this documentation very, very thoroughly. Those two legal firms being Russell McVeigh on behalf of the LGFA,  They were instructed by the LGFA to redraft the documentation. And then Simpson-Greyson has effectively been the legal advice in regard to the councils. They've comprehensively reviewed the documentation on behalf of the Shareholders' Council, the Shareholders' Council representing the interests of the councils.  OK, so we have very much relied on that. Your Worship, I have had some questions overnight from Councillor St Pierre and in a conversation this morning before this meeting, I've been able to address those concerns to the Councillor's satisfaction. Apart from one, which I actually did have a very quick conversation with Simpson-Greyson this morning on,  And I did hope I'd get a response, and in fact I'm just checking the email on my phone right now. It doesn't look like that response has come through yet. But look, that one was a very, I guess, a relatively simple matter of the multi-issuer deed has removed the definition of a local authority.  And Councillor St Pierre's question was, you know, why have they removed the definition of a local authority from the multi-issuer deed? That definition actually still appears on the other two documents, but it's been removed from that one. So, like I say, I did ring Simpson Greaves in just about 15 minutes before this meeting commenced this morning, just asking them if they can explain that I haven't had a response back.  to date, but I would suggest\u2014although, yeah, you're happy for Councillors here to comment, obviously\u2014I would suggest that, you know, I would have thought that that was relatively minor in the scale of things as to why that definition has been removed. I'm sure it is for good reason, but I just can't give you that reason right now.  Okay, so with those things said, yeah, these are pretty complex legal documents. Yeah, but as I say, there has been very thorough legal review and they are giving effect to historic decisions.  What we are asking you today is for your approval of Council signing these, and the mechanism for the signing is two elected members, because these are deeds. We require two elected members to sign these a little later this week, because there is quite a tight deadline on these.  So, yes, we will be in contact subject to this resolution going through. We will be in contact with a couple of you in the next day or two to actually sign these documents as well. OK, thanks, Ken.",

And, of course, it really is because of that definition, you know, it sets the scene for who can actually participate. And if there was a broader definition of a local authority, whatever that might be, yeah, it would just mean that more people might say, well, I'm entitled to borrow this way as well. That's all. And I'm quite happy with the approach that Ken's taken. I said I'm quite happy to support  you know, the recommendation, but I just thought it was strange and he's been able to look into it. So that's great. Greg Morgan Thanks, Clare.",

I think that's almost a typo, because you can actually see that the rest of Cameron's email address is missing.  And immediately after that, we've got Sarah Davies at ypardc.govt.nz. So yeah, so look for, I think a gremlin has snuck into the system, and his name is, they've deleted half the email address, but not fully. So yeah.  Yes, yeah, yeah. Well, actually, if you notice, I'm pretty sure he's appearing a couple of pages later in West of Bay of Plenty. You will see that. Yeah, the very next page he does appear there. Look, that is a straight typo. I suggest that what we do there is that when we actually sign the executed copy of this agreement, that we put a stroke through Kimara and Dot Perumal.  Yeah, yeah, but yeah, we're well spotted. I'm pretty sure in all the other references, you know, because I remember seeing track change versions with Camarron's details quite clearly struck out and replaced by zero.",

I suppose the only comment, Ken, that I'd make is just as long as you and Gary are confident that we've had that legal  checking of the documents, because certainly reading them, I didn't pick up anything, but I'm not a lawyer by any means. So, as long as we've had that level of confidence, then I'll call for a mover and a seconder.",
