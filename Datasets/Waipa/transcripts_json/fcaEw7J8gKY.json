So this report is pretty much just to advise the committee on changes in the governance structure, as well as the Chief Executive at Civic Financial Services, and also just a summary of the six-month unaudited results up to the end of June 2021.  So changes on the board. The new chairperson is John Mulville. He has been a director of the company for a couple of years, and he was also the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee. The outgoing chairperson, Tony Marriott, will remain as a director on the board.  The chief executive, the new chief executive is Charlie Ho, with effect from 1 September, 2021. The outgoing chief executive will remain as an executive consultant until his retirement in February, 2022. Then the half yearly results show an unaudited pre-tax profit of $399,000.  It's worth noting that the net asset value has increased as well as the fact that they show positive cash flows from operating results.",

The cost of service, you can see there, is tracking along and we are pretty much  at the anticipated 25%. There's just a few slight variances there. Capital expenditure is at 4% of the forecast at the moment. You could see there that we had quite a bit of carry forwards from the 2021 year. Most of those were from the waters areas. So there's a lot of carry forward there and  If you come down into the key risk indicator report, you can see that that is actually tracking at risk at the moment. But we do have the re-forecasting coming up in October. So that'll be looked at then. So hopefully it will look a lot better after that. And also on that,  key risk indicator report. I just wanted to point out the other red at risk area is the borrowing interest rates. And I'll just let Amy talk to you about that.",

    "text": " Hi, good afternoon. So we originally forecasted that our weighted interest average would be 1.28%, but currently it's at 1.58%. This is mainly due to 33 million  that shifted from short-term debt to long-term loans, and that changed the interest rate that we were borrowing it at. We also borrowed an extra eight million at a lower interest rate, and then we paid it back, so that was short-term loan as well. So that's ultimately changed it from  1.28% to 1.58% was the difference in the borrowing times and the interest rates from the short-term loans to the long-term loans. I did some forecasting, some interest expense forecasting, and we're looking at  an extra $122,000 in interest expense. So not a lot over, but yeah.",

So, look, I guess, I mean, one of the things that we did that Amy talked about in terms of moving off those floating rates into fixed rates is, you know, taking the opportunity to lock in those fixed rates at very low amounts.  So, yeah, so look, I noticed, so in terms of that $33 million that Amy said, we're locked into longer term rates. So, yeah, so one lot of that is through to 2024, so three years away, and that's just over 1%. And in fact, that's actually 23% of our debt at the moment.  So nearly a quarter of our debt locked in at just over 1% for three years. And then another chunk, which represents about 13% of our current debt, that's been locked into 2026 at 1.76%.  So we've taken the opportunity to lock into these lower rates as much as possible. And of course, we are going to be borrowing a bit more this year for the capital program.  Again, some of those low rates, because those were quite recent, some of those low rates will still be very much available to us. So yeah, so look, I think we're in a really good place in terms of our debt to keep the borrowing rates and that average borrowing cost low for quite some time into the future. But yeah, as Amy said, no doubt about it, interest rates are increasing. We've known that for several months now.  and yeah, we are just starting to see the start of those rises. Thanks, Ken.",
