I don't make any decisions and I do not sit on the committee of the Te Aumutu Combined Churches and Community Food Bank. However, we work very closely with them  at Kainga Aroha, so it just might be better that I don't be involved in that conversation. I am a member of the Te Ao Mutu M\u0101ori Women's Welfare League, and like Lou, I'm fairly closely involved with that group around the roses, so I would prefer not to be part of that discussion either. So those are all our conflicts of interest.  Just checking in, Kieran, did we need to move anything seeing as we had some conflicts there? No, you don't. Cool, that's all good, thank you. We don't have any late items unless anybody from the board has something they want to have included. No, okay, we will move on to the confirmation of the order of the meeting and as Kieran outlined, we're wanting to move the working group just forward slightly  So can I please have someone move that the Te Aumutu Community Board confirm the order of the meeting with item 12, Who Are We? Te Aumutu Working Group, moving to follow item nine of being the quarterly report. Jill, thank you. Someone to second that? I'll second it, Ange. Thanks, Susan. All in favour? Aye. Against? Carried.  Okie dokie. Right, we're going to go to Bill Harris. He's here this evening representing the Rangiw\u0101whia Trust and he's just going to speak to their application that was approved back in 2016, just to clarify exactly what they're wanting to do out at Lake Ng\u0101 Roto in regard to the  Waharoa and the storyboard signage. So, Bill, welcome. It's lovely to have you here this evening. So, Paul Marier, and the floor is yours.",

It's great. I have, as you know, I'm the chairperson for the Ng\u0101ti Apakura R\u016bnanga Trust and the Rangiawhia component  sits under the runanga. And for some time now, I've had a few questions asked by the community board about the funding that was set aside for Ngaroto, or Wairoto, as we tend to call it, if you happen to be Apakura. So, and happy for others to call it Wairoto as well, and I know that in the dual signage stuff that Brad's been doing some work in and around there, and I thank you, Brad, for that.  Where we're up to is that, like, the only one that I know that was part of the original request in terms of this funding was Jenny Charman. Jenny Charman's subsequently moved out of the region and is presently in T\u0101maki. And, you know, it does struggle to hear and to be present with us, although she certainly sits here  in terms of the kaum\u0101tua and fire space that we have developed for her inside the runanga. So still a big part, Jenny Chalmers is still a big part of Ng\u0101ti Apakura. So I was a bit lost as to the exact nature of the funding that had been approved. And when I looked at a few visits I've had of recent times out to Wairauto to  I've looked at the carvings that have been already done and are at the entrance way there, just down by the rowing club. The thing that struck me personally and in terms of  wider of the carvings was that there is nothing there to say who did them. There's nothing there to say what they depict in regards to the carver. And when I had been approached about the funding, I thought, well, probably we need to tell that story as much as anything.  And I had proposed in the discussions I'd had with Ange that perhaps we need to have that story. Now, we can do some po and we can do a wahara to go around the storyboard. And I'm happy to do that if that's what the decision was, the initial decision in approving this by the community board. We can do something like that. But first and foremost, I think that more than anything,  and also to recognise the story that those p\u014d tell. So, that's what I wanted to signal to the community board. I don't know that what I'm proposing here to you all now is a big deal, but I do know that  is a change, but if it is a change, I would ask to have some, you know, that you think about that and possibly come back to us. And I'd hope that you would be supportive of the proposal. That's probably my five minutes, Ange, but I'm happy to hear what the board has to say. I am trying to spend what was offered. Kia ora Bill, appreciate that.",

I'm just trying to clarify, other than the obvious need potentially for there to be interpretive signage and naming of the existing artworks out there.

We have a few carvers coming up to Rangihophia on the 23rd of April, and I'm intending to talk to them a bit more about  the proposal I'm putting to you tonight, if that's acceptable to everybody.

I did, I just want to add that Brad and I had a bit of a discussion and because I know one of the things was around, if I recall correctly, there was a comment made that sort of $7,000 is quite a lot for signage, but I had a bit of a chat with Brad yesterday  and he actually felt that that wasn't out of the question to be spending that sort of money towards the storytelling and the signage that would be required to make sure that it's in keeping with existing signage that's being put out at Wairoto. So that sort of quelled any concerns I had in the back of my head as well in regard to the cost of signage. I don't know if anyone had anything  further to add or question there regarding that component of it. And no, was there anything there? Because I also just wanted to add that it did say that we were putting that money towards a waharoa and signage. So I suppose in my thinking, and I stand to be corrected that if the signage component is going to take up most of that fund, well, then that's gone towards what they applied for.  So is there any other comments in regard to that? And we're happy with the clarity and for Bill and the Rangiw\u0101whia Trust to proceed with using that fund that had been allocated to them.",

    "text": "No, all good. Thank you, Kirsty. So, look, as I'm sure you're all aware, this annual plan is the second year of our latest long-term plan, which was struck in 2020.  And as such, sometimes... So what we're showing here is really the variations from what was in the long-term plan by and large. So the main things that have happened is... I'll go by the screen first, sorry. So the annual plan sets out what we're doing basically in that year. The big issues we're facing, the key projects, budget,  funding sources and changes from the long term plan. So the annual plan is how we set the rates and also fees and charges, et cetera, for the financial year in question. So very importantly, the plan is a chance for us to review how we're doing against the long term plan.  and we are largely on track delivering what was planned. The major differences are things that are timing, we'll come to shortly, and we're factoring in the challenges that our community is facing and thinking about next year, but future years as well.  So in the long-term plan in year two, we forecast a rates rise of 4.4% and we're proposing in this annual plan a rise of 4.3. That 4.3 is what each individual ratepayer will pay on average. It can vary, that does vary a little bit. And it is,  net after growth. So because our district's grown substantially, we have new rate payers each year, quite a substantial number, and that impacts on the overall rates, the overall amount of rates the district requires. Yes, so overall, as it says at the bottom there, it's 7.3%, but individually, yeah. How the rates are spent.  Community services and facilities are the biggest chunk. Roads and footpaths next. I can't recall this from the back, but I'm assuming that rates and roads and footpaths is net of the subsidy from Waka Kotahi.  Yeah, yeah. And Susan's nodding her head. So, because I know roads is a very big chunk of our overall expenditure. Stormwater, water treatment and supply, and wastewater, the three waters between them are another very big chunk of our expenditure. And then planning, of course, and governance, which we're all part of.  So yeah, we're going to spend about $175 million on capital projects, all things going to plan. These capital projects are largely where we get some timing issues. Occasionally we will bring a project forward, more often it's deferred for sometimes as mundane a reason as the weather.  So, adjustments to our capital work paid programme. And it is basically all timing. Te Ameru Te Porongia via Ngaroto has been deferred only because of the issues in getting affected landholders agreements, but  I'm happy to report that really substantial progress has been made in the last two or three months with that. And we have a report coming to committee next Tuesday, I believe, detailing that. So our fingers are all crossed that we're going to get some actual work done this coming summer. Yeah, the other  major thing affecting the Te Aumutu district, well the whole district actually, is the recycling, targeted recycling rate and the high cost that contamination of recycling has had to be addressed.  It's not very disappointing, actually, but it's just a fact of life, and we will do education programs, et cetera, to try and minimize that, but there we are. And also, yes, urban mobility. In a nutshell, Waka Kotahi's run out of money, so they haven't been able to co-fund this program, but this is a deferral. It will happen.  and it needs to happen. Improving the walking and cycling infrastructure of our towns is really important. So, key projects coming up. As I said, the cycleway. At Te Arawa, the initial design phase will happen.  District-wide skate parks, skate parks, Te Awamutu is happening right now. The two new ones, Kihikihi and Pirongia, are in the early stages. I know there's time and care being taken on making sure they go in the right places. And these really, I mean, I know we're impatient to have them, but  putting them in the right places is critical. So there is some time being spent in that area. We have, yeah, ongoing growth for residential and industrial development. And that's where the biggest deferral of capital expenditure has taken place, actually, in Cambridge and in their big  residential developments. It's just a developer-led deferral, effectively. Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant is a massive project, very expensive, and it has to be in place no later than 25, 26 from memory. So it is urgent as well. And the Waip\u0101 Community Spatial Plan, this is a  a huge undertaking, but will form the basis for this district for the next 30 plus years. Getting this done properly, it's going to be transformational for the district. It will turn us into a truly strategy-led  district and, you know, will have great benefits. So I know the team is reaching out to all sorts of interested parties, and they're not particularly getting a great response. I think probably a lot of people aren't understanding how crucial this can be to  not only the district as a whole, but all the groups that are involved in it. So, I mean, if you're talking to movers and shakers in the area, just encourage them to become involved. It's a really big and important undertaking. Okay, so yeah,  We do have online tools, a rates calculator at the site advertised there. And by all means, encourage people to go and check it out, see what their rates are going to be, see how they're spent. Yeah, it's got a great little tool. So I guess that's about me.  The thing is, have your say. We've got feedback through to the 20th of April, only another eight days. Submissions can be done online or via hard copy forms that are available, library, council, et cetera. And that feedback will be listened to and read  and dealt with in the early May at our planning meeting and do encourage people to feedback. We do take notice of what people say. We can't always act on the suggestions as they might like, but it does help us when we're compiling the next long-term plan in particular to know  people's priorities and what they're thinking and feeling. So yeah, I guess that's me. And if anyone has any questions, I have a great team of people to help me answer them. So go for gold.",

One in particular was concerning with the government's  attempts to consolidate, I suppose, city and town centres, and it does affect both Te Awamutu and Cambridge. But what about green spaces? And of course, with new subdivisions, we can plan decent and proper green spaces.  But when we're intensifying the middle of our towns, we are somewhat limited, but as was pointed out by, not sure, Sally Sheedy, I think actually, but we do, we can spend money and will spend money and get the development contributions to improve the spaces we do have and make them more user-friendly, better, et cetera.  So yeah, but there was a number of really good questions coming out of that meeting.",

So this next round of engagement, we are reaching out to technical stakeholders. So the likes of  central government agencies, partner councils. We've also had separate rounds of engagement with mana whenua and iwi, but there will be an opportunity for community stakeholders to have input into the development of the plan.  and then a wider community consultation nearing the end of the calendar year. So I guess when we've reached out to stakeholders, we haven't always got a response. We've actually had a number of meetings scheduled about 30 over the last couple of weeks with different stakeholders. So certainly if people are out there talking about it and they've been approached, encourage them to participate.  as the stakeholder. And then once we're coming out to the wider community, certainly we would be wanting or asking you to champion the plan and encourage people to jump online. We've got a website, so there's some background introductory information on that. And as we progress the plan through the next engagement phase through to selecting a preferred scenario, there will be more information uploaded to that website.  We've also engaged a social support agency interactions who do illustration work to help us to be able to clearly explain the story as to what the Waip\u0101 community spatial plan is, why we're developing it and what we hope it will achieve. So  really asking you to champion this piece of work. It is a key project, and we'll also ask you to be involved as we move to implementation in future years. Yeah. Cool. Oh, thanks for that, Kirsty. And look, we're happy to come back and engage with the community board at any future time on that specifically. Great.",

We've got quite a strong reference group from Cambridge, but Te Amutu lacks a little bit of impetus in that reference group.

    "text": "Thanks Ange. Kia ora everyone. I'm going to try and share my screen. Can you see? The table I've shared hopefully. Yep, cool. So we thought it'd be useful to take you through our plan changes work program. It's growing and expanding.  And there's some that might be of interest to the community board. So I'll just run through this. It is in the agenda. So the first one is what we're calling Plan Change 26. And I think Andrew alluded to it in his response on the annual plan. So this is the one that the government said to all tier one councils that we must do a plan change to permit up to three houses, up to three storeys in all residential zones.  So it's pretty big, it's blindsided all tier one councils, we are a tier one council. And so we've got it in a work programme now, it's called Plan Change 26. And what it means is all residential zones in Cambridge, Te Awamutu and Kihikihi, because Kihikihi is within Te Awamutu urban boundary. Under the plan change, we are required as a default to intensify within those residential zones. We do have the ability to  have some exclusions in there. And we're trying to understand what that looks like. It's a pretty high bar to get exclusions in there. We're doing quite a bit of work behind the scenes to get that done. So that must be notified by the 20th of August. And on the date of notification, those rules come into immediate effect. So it's quite an unusual plan change. The government's really pushing councils to, I guess, promote intensification. There's some obvious concerns around what it means for infrastructure.  erosion of the urban design and amenity. And so all councils who've had this, that we need to respond to, have expressed some concerns back to ministries, the Ministry of Housing, Urban Development and MFE about what it might mean for us. So we've got that one. The next one is Plan Change 21. It's a companion one, and we will always plan to do this. So this is a council plan change. It was intended to intensify  general, and what we're doing now is we split 26 and 21. So 21, it looks at enabling affordable housing and mechanisms for doing that. It looks at strengthening urban design across the district and also looks at two growth cells. So there's C11, which is a growth cell on the outskirts of Cambridge, and there's T6, which is a growth cell between Kehekehi and Te Wanamutu opposite the golf course.  So T6 is currently zoned large lot residential. We've got an independent consultant to look at whether there's opportunity for intensifying any of the growth cells. And his recommendation was that we should look at residential in the T6 growth cell. So the proposal there is to look at the opportunity to change that from existing large lot residential to standard density residential. So quite a lot of work involved in that.  At the moment, that provides for about 400 large lots, and some of them are already being developed. If it was full residential across the whole zone, which is a little bit unrealistic, then it would be about 2,000 additional houses. But that's unrealistic because of topography, because some of those sites have already been developed, and they are probably precluded because of their configuration from re-subdivision. So there's that one that'll be of interest. That'll be publicly notified at the same time as Plan Change 26, because we want to run them in tandem.  So 20th of August, we're looking at notifying both of those. Plan Change 17 is on the outskirts of Cambridge, Hautapu, so that's looking at some industrial zoning there. Plan Change 20, you may be interested in, that's a private plan change. The airport is looking to extend an already zoned area called the Northern Precinct, which is the northwestern end of the airport. They bought some rural land and they want to extend the zoning to allow commercial slash industrial in that area.  That will be a private one, we expect that to be lodged this month, actually, April, they said, and then it'll go through a normal process. Plan change 19 is Carter Slats, it's in Cambridge. Plan change 22 is Anchor Park, so that'll be of interest. That's on a bit of a go slow, Council owns some land there on part of Anchor Park, and we're looking at the opportunity to rezone that. Currently,  specialised industrial, rezone that to residential for more housing. But there's a bit of a process to go through and that's on a go slow at the moment. And just the other update I can provide on this since this report was presented. So it's shown, Plan Change 23, which is Papak\u0101inga, is deferred. We now have some very clear direction to get that underway. And we're looking at reactivating that. It's been on our to-do list for quite a while, but because of the other priorities,  We just had to do a triage exercise to see what we could realistically do. So we're now looking at reactivating the public climate plan change. So as you can see, quite a full list. There are some there that will be of interest to the community board, but I thought it was worth just taking you through that and happy to answer any questions. I'll stop sharing now as well.",

So we have found some, I guess, kick-off money to get a consultant on board, and there's a process to go through getting a consultant on board.  the right consultant, so some kickoff money to do some scoping to understand how big it is and what actually we need to change in the plan. And from there, we'll see if we can secure some secondary funding through Council's existing funding budget to engage a consultant to run the plan change through.

    "text": "Cool. Evening, Chair and committee members.  Yep, so this is the water services activity report till February. Yep, so we'll take it as read and just go through a few particular items just to talk about. So the first one is the flood hazard mapping. We sent out 100 letters have been sent out to properties that have been confirmed as in the flood hazard zone and likely to be impacted in a one in 100 year rainfall event.  And we've still got the last final 10 or so properties that we're doing a technical review on before we send those letters out and they're the ones that are right on the edge of should we include them or not so we're just doing a bit more review of those before we send them out. And in line with that the public flood hazard map viewer is now available online.  So you can go on our maps online and look at the flood hazard map. And that will show areas across the district that we've determined as liable to flood in the one in 100 year event. So if you haven't had a look at that, and then it's a good little tool to have a look at. It says here, we were working on submissions for tomato ROIs, drinking water regulations, but we've completed those submissions and they've been sent off.  to look at the proposals for source water protection. Physical works have commenced on Lake Tika'utu Rain Gardens, which is in Cambridge, Lakeview Drive stormwater improvements, and Shelley Street outflow placement. I'll talk about those in a little while more, further on in the report.  And the good news, I suppose, is although it's been a long, hot, dry summer, we've had no water restrictions. And that's largely based on our significant investment the council have made over the last 10 years, coal maintenance, completion of the Parallel Road water treatment plant, supply and drinking water to Te Amute. So the first year for a long time, we haven't had any restrictions. And again, that is a very good story, recognising all the work that's been achieved over the last 10 years.  Having said that, the new parallel treatment plant was non-compliant for protozoa removal. And this was a technical non-compliance from incorrect programming of the new membranes that was not identified during commissioning. This has since been rectified and they're now fully compliant.  so it's a bit of a an embarrassing faux pas just as we got underway with with supply moored to Tiamutu. So just touch again on the tomato ROI draft compliance rules so we're we're working through that submission and I think we got a an extension but we have now completed that  And that that looks at all the drinking water standards drinking water quality assurance rules aesthetic values acceptable solution for roof water supplies. acceptable solutions for spring and bore water supplies several solutions for rural agricultural water supplies.  and Drinkwater Network Environmental Performance Measures. So all those topics amongst others were in the new rules that come into effect from July that we need to comply with. And so it was the last chance to submit on them.  Item 3.1.2, the Water Supply Bylaw 2013 is currently under review. It wasn't due for review until next year, but we've brought it forward a year because there's quite a few bylaws being reviewed next year. So there was a lull in bylaw reviews. So we took the opportunity to do this one early. In particular, it enables us to make some changes around  the new rules and regulations, and also brings into line with water metering, backflow prevention, and water source protection are some of the things we will add to the bylaw. And that will be out for public submissions shortly. Next, to talk about  Is in the risk management section five. I suppose the key point around this is cost escalations. So as price increases are expected to increase over the coming months and we're out for some contract renewals and in particular around electricity supply and chemical supply.  We're just coming to the end of some five-year contracts, so we're expecting quite a significant increase in costs in those areas. And septage tankard waste, which again, mainly we haven't got a septage tankard receiver in Timutu, but it's in Cambridge. We're currently working to manage that a bit better to reduce the risk of that contaminating the Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant.  But they do, you know, septage is collected from around the district and disposed of in Cambridge from all rural properties that run septic tanks. So it does impact the whole district. And the last few, again, of those three stormwater projects. So Lakeview Drive, we've just done some improvements there to to make sure we meet the level of service. And that's that's now completed.  The Shelley Street stormwater outlet renewal, though it's expected to be complete in June there, we've had to defer that until next summer. Again, we needed to purchase some large concrete pre-manufactured equipment, infrastructure, and we've been unable to source that due to COVID and many other reasons. So we'd have to defer the works till next summer. We can't do them in the winter.  And then Lake Takuto rain garden. So we're starting work just after Easter now, but we've put the signs up recently and we've replicated the signs there. So we're putting in rain gardens on the busy intersections that capture the road runoff and capture the gross pollutants from that road runoff before it then gets discharged to the lake. So it's an early, early start of trying to improve the condition of the lake and one that can be achieved  quite effectively with the rain gardens. And the rain gardens are quite complicated. They look simple, but they do a lot of complicated work underneath the plants to remove those pollutants. So that's a really good story once we get started on the work. And I'm happy to answer any questions from there.",

So after a long dry period, there's all those contaminants on the road, that first flush of rain comes in, and that's the pollutants it's trying to capture.",

I don't use the computer a lot, so I wouldn't have had a clue about any of these things. Do people just tune in on a Wednesday?

And at 5.3, there's decisions  still to be made for the completion of the project and a number of options there listed in terms of what you might do with the decisions already made in future decisions to date, which I think probably  for the board to discuss unless there's any other updates that are there from the working group.

So it's not an easy thing, and,  You know, some of the reasons, I just want to, if you can bear with me for five minutes, because I think it's important that people understand what this is all about.  and why it fails 85% of the time is people misunderstand the meaning of branding for a start. So a brand is simply what do people think about it. So what we're trying to do is find out what do people think about Te Amutu. A brand is not Rosetown, that is just a tagline to support a brand.  So Te Amuru has a brand now, but it may not be the one you want to have. So you need to manage and guide it. So that's what we're trying to find out. What is Te Amuru's brand now? What do people think of Te Amuru? And the reasons why they haven't worked in the past is because there's no consultation with all the stakeholders. A brand that over promises and under delivers, it's not authentic.  Not involving younger generation. It's a missing an emotional connection. It's not daring to be different. Lack of funding and commitment. Unrealistic timeframes that result in poor processes. And a place brand not supported by policies, innovation, events, structures, investment, and actions. And you can probably argue that Rosetown isn't supported by anything like that.  And place branding that is not a top-down exercise, but will only produce the best results when it is created and maintained through a strong coalition between local government, business, civil society, and target markets. So that's what the research says is why small town branding fails. So it's not an easy task.  It's interesting to note that the South Waikato district is going through the same process, and they've got a budget of $488,000. And the mayor, Jenny Shatlock, admits that rebranding is not an easy task, as there's been a number of attempts by the council to create a district branding in the past 15 years that has not succeeded because they are not well funded or resourced. So it's not an easy thing, but I think it's worthwhile to just  to do our best at getting feedback from the residents of Te Amuru and based on that then make some assumptions about what sort of identity Te Amuru might want to have in the future.",

Engaging with community groups and street surveys to gather information,  selecting a winner for the prize, producing a report which collates the findings of the survey and feedback from other types of community engagement. So are we happy with that? Can we have someone to move that then? Jill? And a seconder? Sorry, I can't see all of you. Thanks, Lou. I'll stop sharing, yeah. Cool, thank you. All in favor? Aye. Aye.

No, it's definitely a cameo cat that's sitting here peering in the window at me. So anywho, moving on. We move to item 10, which is the Treasury report on pages 53 and 55.  So I'll just quickly jump in there. Is there anything anyone wanted to bring up, point out, any further discussion? Are we all happy with the rangi o awhia? Oh, where's it gone? There we go. Position and clarity around what they're wanting to do and costs. Just as a by the way, I'm not sure if Bill's still here,  And if he is, he can correct me if I've got this a bit wrong, but he was saying that the cost of poe now are something around about $15,000 each by the time they pay the carver and get the wood or the appropriate timber. So I thought that was quite an interesting update on just what costs are involved there.  Right, so we currently have a balance of $30,819.17, which we're about to get a hiding. And I don't think there's anything too much else sitting there. So if everybody's happy with that, we can probably just move that and move on to the discretionary fund application. So has anyone got anything they would like to comment about for the Treasury report?  No, okay, so can I just have someone to move that the Treasury report, Te Aumat\u016b Community Board of Ng\u0101i Te Milng Financial Accountant for the period ended 28th February 2022 be received. Thanks Richard. Seconder? Jill? All in favour? Against? Carried. I just wanted to ask one quick question. Kieran, you might know the answer to this.

And it's predominantly the AA, Cs, Ds, those types of batteries. So just as a by the way in there.  in regard to the battery collection. All righty, we will move on to item 11, which it's gonna be pages 62 all the way to page 354. And we have $68,358.72 of applications with 17 applicants.  that we need to get through. Now, I just had some things I wanted to run past everyone first, before we get into the discretionary fund and just sort of talk about the format. I'm not sure if everyone managed to spot my email today, just to give you the heads up of what I wanted to ask tonight, but we need to discuss it in the meeting. So first up, do we want to allocate all of the funding  or hold back a little in case we want to support or do something ourselves. So just as an example, there was a discussion that maybe we provide a couple of chairs as part of the streetscape stuff with the urban mobility. It's just an idea. Or were there one of the things that we've got in our strategic plan that we want to hold some money back for?  before the end of our term, or are we wanting to allocate the full $30,819 in uncommitted funds?",

So we're about $300 in from the first two lots. So yeah, so we're sort of averaging 35 kilos a time, I suppose, at the moment. So does that answer that okay? Yeah, thank you.  Anyone else got any comments around the amount that we want to allocate? Or have your allocations sort of automatically fallen that will leave us with some funding anyway?",

You get 49,000. So what are you holding on to? If we hold on to funds for long,  you'll find your allocations will be looked at by your councillors, the amount of money you're getting given. If you can't spend it all, they'll use it. I've seen, we've had this situation with funds and other organisations I sit on. So you've got to be a little bit careful that you retain too much and you don't do your discretionary funding. It might be deemed that you don't need that sort of funding.",

And again, it's probably going to balance out based on the way we work it out. But just wanted to check if that was something we wanted to do. This is not an amount in the application, Paul? No, well, it says  When, no, it doesn't actually. And so, I mean, I don't want to take too long here. So there isn't, and when they do the advertising for the discretionary fund, they don't imply that we don't have a small, you know, like it's not a huge amount of money. And so we're getting these really big grants that there's no way we're going to get anywhere near giving people  the amount of money that they're asking for. So it'd be nice that there could be, and the community board usually gives out around this much money to sort of give people a little bit of an indication as opposed to implying that if they had something big, we may consider it. Because when we're only getting given 49,000, yeah, we're not gonna be giving someone 15 or 20, are we?  It's definitely something that needs addressing in the promotion. And no, it doesn't actually say, but anyway, yeah. Are we going to allocate everyone something or just give to those not previously requested this time around to get us through?

So I was going to also suggest that when we do that, that we clump those ones together that I can't participate in just to keep the meeting running a bit quicker and a bit more smoothly. So when we get to the first one, we'll then just bunch the ones that I have a conflict of interest with and do those all together, if that's all right.  So I just wanted to cover off how we're going to go into public excluded. So before we get into the applications, hang on, what have I got here? Yeah, so basically the way it's gonna run is that we won't discuss any of the financial or confidential part of any of the applications.  We will, if we need to, if there's anything that anyone has got, where we've got questions in regard to that, we will need to go to a public excluded part of our meeting. So I just wanted to have a quick check. I imagine there will be, but does anyone have any questions in regard to the financial position of any of these organisations that we're deciding on that we will? Richard, yep. I think I have a couple as well, so.",

So I would like to make a recommendation. Oh, I need the recommendation. Sorry, I need to go to the end of that. And we'll get started with this part of the meeting and then we'll come back  and run through each of the organisations. So I'd like to make a recommendation that the public be excluded from the following parts of the proceedings of this meeting. The general subject of the matters to be considered while the public is excluded, the reason for passing this resolution in relation to each matter and the specific grounds for excluding the public is specified by section 48.1 of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act  1987. Magoima are set out below. I assume I don't have to read all of that. This resolution is made in reliance on section 48.1 part A of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 and the particular interest or interests protected by section 6 or section 7 of that Act or section 6, 7 or 9 of the Official Information Act 1982 is a case made  which would be prejudiced by the holding of the whole or relevant part of the proceedings of the meeting in public are as follows. So the interest is from section seven, bar two, bar C, to protect information which is subject to an obligation of competence where the making available of the information would be likely to prejudice the supply of similar information or information from the same source.  where it is in the public interest that such information should continue to be supplied. So can I have someone to move the recommendation that we go public excluded to discuss these financial queries? And then we will come back to the meeting after that. Richard, seconder?
