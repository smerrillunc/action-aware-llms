    "text": " So, we'll crack on. The various stages and components of water reform. We've had a number of meetings with the Council about water reform. We've had a number of meetings with the Council about water reform.  I know it's been an ongoing discussion and we've endeavoured to share with you all of the information sort of as quickly as possible, but certainly it's been somewhat relentless, I guess, in terms of the information that's been shared by the DIA and LGNZ.  So the government via DIA and LGNZ have asked us to provide feedback on their proposal for a water services entity and particularly feedback on the entity proposal itself. So this is on the outline of the entity that was released at the LGNZ conference in mid-July. So LGNZ have provided us with a relatively standard template report that we'll bring to you. And as I say, it's got to be with them by the end of the month.  So also during this period, further information has been provided and we'll work through that as part of this presentation. So there is quite a bit to get through. We've done a bit of an in-depth analysis in a couple of areas. So if you've got any questions, if you can save them to the end, that might be helpful.  So just to be really, really clear, while the government stated direction of travel has been for publicly owned, multi-regional models with a requirement around local authority ownership, this is not the time or indeed the opportunity for us to make any decisions around opting in or opting out of the reform itself. What we're looking at the moment is to identify what we support and don't support around the entity proposal.  And specifically through LGNZ DIA, we've been asked to comment around how do we make sure that all of our communities have a voice in the system and influence over local decisions, how we ensure that we've got effective representation within those water entities, and then also making sure we've got integration between our growth planning and our water services delivery.  So as I say, this is a no regrets assessment. Whether the reforms proceed or not, what we're looking for is to ensure that we capture all of the feedback on the entity itself. So looking at the impacts on our community well-being, but also looking at the impacts on council and our future impact on staff and sort of sustainability of the council.  So acknowledging that, I also wanted to acknowledge that in our previous discussions, there have been concerns raised about the reform agenda. And we've heard these significant concerns that you've raised. And that includes that overall, this reform programme is not supported by Waip\u0101 District Council. The review of local government should have been ahead of this alongside the RMA reform so that the timing's not truly appropriate.  that the process has been somewhat disingenuous to the great work that Waipa have done historically in managing their three waters and ensuring great delivery of services to our community. And also we've heard that the public input to this process is absolutely critical, but it's currently missing. So the community are not being brought along on the journey as part of this process.  kind of, I guess, make sure that we had all of the questions that yourselves had around this to prepare for both this presentation and for the report at the end of September. And what we heard from you is, you know,  that the regulatory requirements you don't believe will be as excessive as forecast. I believe they will be. So I thought it was worth sort of just recognising that. All that we're hearing around the regulatory framework coming from Te Mata Arawai is that there will be a significant increase in costs. There'll be a significant increase in what they require us to achieve. The game really has changed around for compliance.  technical non-compliance will not be accepted. We will have to have a completely robust system alongside the risks for climate change, stormwater management costs, impact fresh water, policy statement requirements are all going to drive changes and increasing costs of delivering the services.  You told us about your concerns around levels of representation in that governance group, and we'll go into that in a little deeper soon. We heard that development contributions, that we've got a very robust model for developing contributions, growth funded growth within Waip\u0101, and that we're very concerned that they might not be continued on by an entity.  The efficiency gains look optimistic with the views expressed. I think all of the peer reviews that have been done of the WICS models has confirmed that the number will be wrong, but it's directionally right.  so that those efficiency gains can be achieved and internationally are achieved when there is a scale to deliver on those areas around particularly in procurement and asset management.  Some of your other feedback was around that the regulator should have been put in place first and allow us to fully understand the implications. However, the government's information they have released indicates they're very concerned that there are affordability challenges across many parts of New Zealand in terms of the ability to respond, and that would just put too much pressure on the system.  We also heard from you that the concern that if we are in an opt-out position, that we won't be able to retain staff if there is a water services entity available in a wider area. We asked a question around what was the ideal entity area and the feedback was sort of positive.  sort of mixed in terms of the scale, but others saying that we should just be looking at maybe the Waikato region only, only look at combining those councils where there is an absolute need for reform or maybe a catchment-based approach. So that was the feedback that we received.  From the Three Waters Steering Committee in late August, we received a series of these sort of sheets giving a little bit more information around not so much the detail, but maybe the sentiment of what the government is proposing in these areas. So we're starting to respond to early signals around where those concerns might lie.  This diagram indicates the proposed entity arrangements for each of the entities A, B, C and D.  In the information that's been provided, the key mechanisms proposed around that representative group for setting strategic direction, the performance expectations, and the oversight of the entity board in terms of their delivery. So that the government in that area has proposed a core role for local government and mana whenua in setting the strategic direction and so forth.  Around the community voice in terms of having a consumer input, that is signalled as a discussion paper being available, providing some more detail on that later in 2021.  The other piece of information that was around the planning interface and that's where that piece of or that document talks about creating a reciprocal obligation between the water services entity, other infrastructure providers and local councils in terms of mechanisms of working together around strategic planning.  So in particular, sort of thinking about the role of the economic regulator and the consumer body, this is an area where I thought it was worth understanding some international sort of best practice in this area. And Haven and our strategy team has done some fantastic work in terms of exploring what that role could look like. So Haven, if you're available,  I'll hand over to you to take us through. Yes, thanks, Dawn, and good morning, everybody.",

    "text": "So I think a lot of people recognise that that economic regulator role could be key, but that we wanted to know more. So we have gone away and done some research on it. So I'm going to quickly run through what we learned about economic regulators and how they operate in different sectors, both here and internationally, and then how that compares with what we currently know about the proposed economic regulator and these reforms.  We'll then run over some of the key questions that we have at this stage, which will hopefully help our thinking about the roles that we might like to see the economic regulator do in this proposed system.  OK, so firstly, I guess being part of Council, we'll all be familiar with regulators, which are entities authorised by statute to use legal tools to achieve policy objectives. So this is primarily through functions such as licensing, permitting, accrediting, approvals, inspection and enforcement.  However, economic regulators are mainly focused on addressing market failures and promoting competition where possible. They generally do this by putting in place arrangements to enable competition. So for example, that's deciding on who can enter an industry or market or making decisions on price. So think of things like price controls. So essentially the key thing that an economic regulator does is to ensure that monopolistic behavior doesn't occur.  Some sectors where economic regulators are common are electricity, both the generation and transmission of telecommunications, water, gas, roads, rail and airports.  So in addition to controlling prices, the other most common functions for economic regulators are access regulations. So that's placing an obligation on infrastructure providers to provide access to a service. Monitoring, that's through providing information on profitability and quality of service to government and stakeholders. Another one is dispute resolution. So that's things like arbitrating and resolving disputes over prices and services provided.  And then the last one is some economic regulators are also involved in setting standards. So an example of that might be setting quality for drinking water. OK, so what do we know about the proposed economic regulator and the free water space? Well, we know that ministers have agreed that the free water sector will be subject to economic regulation, and the purpose of that is to ensure that there's a good quality  of service for the consumer and to drive efficiency gains and then protect against inefficiencies. So again, that's, I guess, thinking of setting prices. The legislation is also to ensure the right level of investment, to meet depreciation, and then to remove those opportunities for monopoly behavior and excessive pricing. So really strong on that one.  Okay, so I think, as was mentioned earlier in the presentation, there's going to be that paper that the Three Waters Steering Group is going to release later this year. And what we know is that the topics that's likely to be covered in that paper  the design of an appropriate dispute resolution process, the establishment of a consumer advocacy council or the extension of an existing body to provide expert advocacy on behalf of consumers, options to protect consumers who are vulnerable due to their age, health, disability or financial position, an ability for a regulator to mandate service quality codes,  and the process for setting prices, including requirements for pricing transparency. So all of those things there that are outlined in what the ministers say will be in the legislation, and then in that paper, they all align exactly with the roles and functions that you might expect any standard economic regulator would play.  It's also worth mentioning that the economic regulator would be part of that wider regulatory group. So as you can see on your screen there, alongside Taumata Atawai and the regional councils.  So from that, it seems the economic regulator would primarily be looking to ensure those positive economic outcomes, while those other regulatory bodies may be more responsible for some of the other well-being outcomes, the environmental, social and cultural ones, although there's much overlap between all of those, yeah, those different areas. So one of the key things we wanna know more about is how they're all gonna work together and align their planning and their decision-making  And I guess the other main question we have is, as I'm sure everyone else does, is how do we ensure that that local voice is heard? So to bring us back to the purpose of this workshop, which is identifying what we support and where further detail or information or explanation will be useful, I'll just go through some starters for 10 for thinking about the economic regulator from a staff perspective.  So as staff, we're generally supportive of the potential functions of an economic regulator, as they've been described in the information that we have to date, that all those potential functions do seem to align well with the best practice.  We think that expanding the scope of the economic regulator beyond pricing is probably useful. And we know that that's something that seems to be under consideration because it's going to be talked about in that discussion paper under that topic of the ability for regulators to mandate service quality codes. So we think that's probably a good thing as it might help ensure that multiple well-beings are provided for and not just that financial economic well-being.  However, we know that Taumata Arawai will be involved in service quality too. So any overlap between those different regulators will need to be worked through. And that's where we think aligned strategic planning between the various stakeholders in the system will be key.  We think the economic regulator is likely to be national. So there won't be separate economic regulators for each individual water service entity. And we think that's probably right. It does align with how Scotland's seemingly successful system works. And in Australia, they seem to have the economic regulators at the state level. So that generally lines up with what's being proposed here if you compare things on a population level basis.  One thing we're keen to know more about is that potential consumer advocacy council. So firstly, who would be on that group? And could it be the same people that are involved in any of the other layers of the system?  And is there going to be one consumer advocacy council for each water service entity, or will that also be national? As staff, we think it's important that there's one consumer advocacy council for each water service entity, so four of them, because we think that could help provide for that local voice.  We'd also like to explore the idea of having an ombudsman play a role in this proposed system. We like the idea of it because it's a model that people are already familiar with and it operates well in other sectors. It also provides another tool for that consumer voice and the resolution of complaints. And it also provides for that fair, independent and quick process.  OK, another thing is that we'd like some certainty that the economic regulator would ensure that principle of growth pays for growth the same way that many other councils do, including ours. And two more things here.  We know that there's that statement of strategic and performance expectations to be drafted, and this is going to place a requirement on the board to report to the representative group. So a question we'd like to explore is whether that statement, the statement of strategic and performance expectations, could include a provision to formalise a link back to the local authorities, ideally each one individually with the water service entity.  And that link could also require consideration of LGA plans, such as annual plans and long-term plans, and even non-statutory plans like a spatial plan. So yeah, that's it from me at this stage. I'll hand back to you, Dawn.",

    "text": "Excellent. Thanks, Haven.  So the other thing that we've undertaken in the last couple of weeks is engagement with our community and offering the opportunity for feedback from our communities. So you'll recall that we have been directed not to consult, formally consult with our community because we don't have a proposal as such to take to our community, but we opened up through a Have Your Say page asking for feedback. So  As of this morning, we had 40 individual, well, over 40 individual pieces of feedback, but the themes are starting to emerge. Certainly centralization could allow, or the risk of privatization, I guess, being there and saying that the bigger is not always better and it comes with some risk.  The talk of much higher employment opportunities within the water services entity, the question being asked about where those people come from. We've got a sector under pressure already. Big one is the risk of loss of local control and decisions over our water and wastewater and stormwater assets.  and also questions around co-governance with iwi. And there seems to be, I guess, a lack of clarity in terms of that role of governance versus ownership emerging.  So certainly emerging from what Haven has shared with us and some key points that we will formulate after our discussion today to take forward to the LGNZ submission, the right level of representation should have much greater local government participation. Certainly the economic regulator needs to fulfil our wellbeing outcomes and not just the financial.  That structure of the consumer form and body needs to provide confidence to our community, but how will it be structured and the ombudsman?  In our workshop with the Taitua R\u0101 team a few weeks ago, they raised a concept that really resonated, I thought, in terms of how do we make sure if a water services entity is established, how do we make sure it's part of the team Waip\u0101 and how's that achieved? We're doing a lot of great work around developing up the Waip\u0101 community plan to deliver on our vision of building connected communities, delivering on our outcomes to our community,  But council is just one part of that. So other infrastructure providers need to be on board. And so any water services entity would have to play a critical role in that part. So how do we assure that they both have the capacity and the capability to be able to play their part?  We also need to ensure that the right mechanisms within legislation are maintained for alignment with our statutory documents, you know, and our long-term plan and our annual plan cycles to make sure that they're well connected. And how will the water services entity be alongside us in the development of those plans and, you know,  you know, in a meaningful way. And thinking about our current commitments to civil defence emergency management roles in our community, you know, that a water services entity will take away a large number of our staff who have previously made that commitment to that role.  Further, any reform could impact on our local social and economic well-being within our communities because our local suppliers are a key part of our supply chain at present. So how do we continue to deliver those services or would a services entity do that and still support that by local and local sustainability aspirations that we have?  At the moment, for our people, there is a confirmation that for staff primarily in waters that they will transfer to any new entity. But, you know, I think we would look for some greater certainty for those staff rather than just being for a set period. Thinking about the levels of service, you know, will that be in a customer charter? How is those commitments delivered to our community for certainty?  There is no talk of an efficiency dividend being delivered back to councils who own the assets. Is that something that might provide opportunities for local reinvestment? Cost harmonization through this process, that across the 22 councils, we've all got very different mechanisms for charging for services. How will that be resolved and any inequities addressed?  And as I've touched on earlier in terms of continuing that growth pays for growth, how will that be ensured into the future? So the other deep dive that we've taken into the financial analysis. So the DIA provided a model for that based on LTP information that was published. So Deborah from our finance team has  done the hard mahi and gone through those. So I'll hand over to Deborah to take you through what she's been able to identify from that information.",

    "text": "So we've had a look at some of the different ratios that was provided to us, being here with the level of debt, with and without reform, the additional debt capacity,  looking at what are debt to revenue ratios that you're more used to, the balance budget, whether we'd be worse off with the stranded overhead costs, which central government is talking about. And we've got a better off funding that's been indicated at 20.975 million as a total. So with this graph,  This is the graph that you're probably more used to seeing from the LTP. The solid blue line is our level of expected debt. The dashed blue line is our debt limit based on our ratio for the LTP, which was 250% of our total revenue. We've added to it our LGFA foundation covenant ratio, which is based on the 300% and it moves down to 285  as we get out to year 10. Now, this gives you an indication of the area that we're able to use as in purchase, sorry, as in take out more debt if we require. And that's the difference between the thick blue line and the dashed line. Now, if we then remove our water, all the water costs and the water revenue,  Dawn, can you put all three up at the same time? Thanks. We've get a new level of debt that we're expected and new limits that we have. So on the 30th of June 24, we expect to have the debt removed from our system. I know the takeover is first of July, but 30th of June is easier based on all these values.  And our level of debt is the LTP, less the internal loans for water, wastewater and stormwater, and the development contribution loans for the three waters. And that drops our debt significantly. So that dark line, dark brown line at the bottom is what our new level of debt would be estimated with reform going ahead. The dashed line in light brown is  based on our 250% ratio limit. So we do have a good level of limits between what our debt is expected and what more debt we could take out. And the dotted line is our level of debt based on the LGFA covenant. What is easier to see is whether we will actually get additional debt capacity for the fact that we would go through the reform.  The blue area is a headroom that we've already seen as per the LTP. And that's between our level of estimated debt and the debt limit based on the 250% ratio, 250% of revenue, I should say. So when we remove the water's debt, we get the brown area or the top of the brown area. Now, the area between the brown  and above the blue is the additional debt capacity that is available for other projects if we go with the reform based on the estimated values of our LTP. So the level of additional capacity starts at the 42 million in the year that we transfer, but within two years, our additional capacity is down to 6.6 million. And then we increase up to between 50 and 55 million  in the last few years of the LTP. And by year 10, we're at the same position as if we were just had no debt, sorry, no reform occurring at all. So though we indicate, yes, we've got some additional debt capacity coming through from the reform, it is not consistent across all years.  Now, this is a similar graph to what we have already seen, but it's based on our debt to total revenue. So instead of dollar terms, this is our percentage. So with the reform occurring, we actually remove our debt, and that drops down our debt by year 10 to be zero external debt. And that's because all our other debt has been repaid.  And we're still staying at a 250%, which is our dotted line. And I've shown the 300% down to 285 being the foundation covenant. So waters make up a large portion of our debt currently. Balanced budget is one area that they've indicated as well that people will be better off, councils will be better off without the three waters.  The blue lines that you see is the balanced debt, balanced budget ratio as per the LTP. Now, the bars should be above the 100% line that you see, the black line, but as part of the LTP, the elected members made an informed decision to prudently make use of reserves to fund the operating costs instead of relying solely on rates. So therefore, we have five bars that fall below the 100% during the 10 years.  That's the 21 year, the 24, 25, 26, and 27 years. Now, with the transfer of all the water assets, the water costs, revenue, and rates going to a new entity, we do have the red bars, which are basically slightly higher in all years, but only makes an impact on two years for us  where it goes above the line and therefore we will be better off. And that's for June 2024 and June 2027. Stranded overheads. The initial assessment of no worths off from central government is three million over the first two years post reform.  But when I've done the calculation of what the overheads that three waters currently have allocated to them, it's approximately 3.8 million per annum. While we've got the ability that some of these costs will no longer be required, we basically believe that there is a very high likely aspect that the stranded overheads, the sum of 3 million, will be very low compared to what  we actually are spending. So the sum being for no worse off will be low than what we require. I'll hand this back to Dawn.",

    "text": "Lovely, thanks Deborah.  So in our analysis there has been some areas where there are opportunities arising and we've just seen one in terms of that headroom for investment in a placemaking and some of those projects that will emerge from our spatial plan, our community plan.  And certainly the opportunity for looking at, you know, where we have shared services arrangements, where we have stranded overheads that may well provide an opportunity for us to work with with our neighbours. And  The, I guess, you know, I spoke earlier about the impacts of compliance requirements from Te Mata Atawai, you know, the impacts of those would be removed from a risk to council. There are the indicated lower costs of delivery of water services to our community.  there would be reduced procurement risks to council because at the scale that the larger entities are proposed, they'll be able to far better respond to market changes across the supply chain. And also that council would not be responsible if a  a non-council private water supplier was unable to meet the standards and asked the water services entity to take over that responsibility for supply.  Through this process, we've also identified that there are areas where work would need to be done through any transition process that we acknowledge that as well. The government have indicated that funding would be available to councils for some of these tasks. And so we have gone through and identified those and the need for that funding support.  So including our waters land holdings to look at what those are at the moment, in some cases, the dual use in terms of local purpose reserve and recreation reserve. So we would have to work through the process of what would transfer what haven't.  Staff engagement is something that we are very, very cognizant of the moment. You know, staff are feeling quite unsettled by this process. And so it's we want to make sure that people are supported as much as possible through this process.  through these times. We're very aware that the DIA are working equally on a no regrets basis around transition and developing up due diligence information requests so that once a direction is known, we're expecting those to arrive and we're expecting them to be even more significant than the WITS request for information at the end of last year.  They'll be asking questions around those charging regimes that we have in place at the moment, our workforce arrangements, our contracting requirements and arrangements. And also we're anticipating asset management.  As we spoke about earlier, asset management is probably a key area. Utilization of technology with a lot of those efficiency gains are going to emerge from. That they are one area I'm sure that from a national perspective, rather even than an entity B perspective, that there'll be some strong requirements and possibly an early adoption of some of those areas within the asset management field, particularly thinking about software and IT systems and the like.  So last slide, thinking about next steps. So as I say, the 30th of September is the deadline for us providing feedback back to LGNZ. And beyond that, we're not quite sure what next steps are, but certainly most recently, government was still indicating that in October, they would make the next decision.  There is a Hui plan for the 22nd of September that His Worship and myself will be attending across the Entity B councils. Because of COVID, there are restrictions on numbers who can attend that. But on the 28th of September at the council meeting, we'll bring a report to you that will be a summary of all of the issues and a copy of the feedback that we are planning on submitting on the 30th of September.  Key question, I guess, is that have we captured all of the concerns and issues that you would like taken back to LGNZ?",

    "text": "Yeah, I think in the last question, I had 14 points. I listed them and numbered them, and they were 14. Yeah, yeah. A couple of other things, though.  understand that by taking water services away from councils, we change the configuration or the way we do business. Now that has hidden economies of scope in it. And it was pointed out in the Castalia reports that we should understand what those economies of scope are. I noticed in the DIA material, they just dismiss it as insignificant.  But in some of the best practice examples that, you know, frameworks that I sent through to you and Haven, they say it's important to quantify them. And I'm wondering whether or not it might be possible at least to say that we want them quantified as an assistance in us making a decision. And I really love the terminology about the WSE being part of Team Waip\u0101  and that you mentioned capacity and capability that would be required to do that. Because I'm really worried that they'll just be too busy and not resourced enough to actually be really part of Team Waip\u0101. And I think it'd be helpful for us to be able to say what sort of things that we'd need them to be participating in maybe on a monthly or a quarterly basis or something. Do you understand the point I'm making? Yeah, to give them an idea of the level of commitment  that might be needed to participate adequately in these processes for our planning and placemaking in that. I like the customer charter, but what I'm worried about is that if we set it up, down the track it might be changed, and what we thought was gonna be able to be delivered through the customer charter actually can't be, or it doesn't have the level of influence, for instance,  if we're getting affordability issues or service issues or something, and we just can't get any traction with the WSE to do anything. So I don't know if there are any safeguards that we could have built into that. And then the last one would be where we'd be working in an environment where we've got small communities and large centres or cities, and how we could get that assurance that  our needs would be up there right with the Hamilton's and the Tauranga's and that sort of thing. This is something that came through in some of the webinars from the far north that they were saying, well, we've had a national roading set up and we just can't seem to get on the top of the list. I think we've been given an assurance, but whether or not that would actually eventuate, I don't know. So those are my main things.  Lovely, thanks, Clare. Thanks, Clare.",

    "text": "Yeah, thank you, Nadhim. Yeah, like Clare, I've got a concern that I can't see a number of the issues that I raised  in my survey actually identified in that list that you put on. And unfortunately there was no opportunity to take a copy of the numerous points that I made, which is a bit of a shame. But I think mostly you've mentioned that we've got concerns over governance representation, but I think the other concern which was mentioned elsewhere in the presentation  was the concern about ownership. And I see that that is a different consideration to the government stroke representation consideration. And I'm worried about what kind of ownership model that is going to be there and what kind of representation we've got in that ownership. Now, one assumes that it's going to be somehow developed on shares  from the level of assets that are put in by the individual TAs. But I'm not too sure what it is, and I am concerned about that ownership model.  Now, the other concern that I've got is the concern over priorities for investment and development of waters infrastructure. Now, whatever that new entity is, there's a limit, there must be some form of limit to the funding and resources that are available. So they're going to have to, in some way, establish the priorities  over the allocation of that resources. Now, currently, we're masters of our own destiny. We can determine where we're going to put our resources that we can get through our balance sheet and determine that they're going into, say, the future planning for WIPOW. We could lose that. Now, I know that there was a statement of intent, but again,  Who's gonna define that statement of intent? Is that going to be a statement that's defined by the owning TAs or the representative model, which will be 50% TA and 50% EWI? So who's going to determine where those priorities lie? I think I certainly mentioned that I've got the concern about the co-ownership model.  and the fact that we could have no representation at all on that representative group.  I mentioned that. And then the lack of community consultation, I think that was a big concern that I actually mentioned. So there were four that I can remember that aren't really reflected in that slide, that page that you had on the elected members' concerns. So if you could perhaps allow the opportunity for other  members to have their input as to what concerns perhaps theirs weren't mentioned. Can I just ask for a point of clarification on the stranded overheads? You mentioned that the determination by Central was that we had 3 million over two years. Your calculation was 3.8 per year.  So my interpretation of that is that over the two years, that's 7.6 million compared to the 3 million that's estimated. Am I correct in that interpretation?",

Certainly the $3.8 billion is the cost that's allocated to the waters activity at the moment, but that covers things like use of depots and those sorts of costs and that will actually go with the activity as well.  So we haven't delved into that. It's just at the moment on a fairly cursory sort of look, we're saying there's likely to be a gap. So the quantum of that gap is probably going to be less than that sum that we're saying, but we're saying that we do feel it's low. But to be fair, the period that we've had to do any analysis or to do that level of understanding is challenging. So it's been a fairly cursory view.",

So let's just say that that's the route that WIPA take. Is there a mechanism if the board, the entity board is not performing,  for the well-being or the goodness of the people of Waip\u0101, who we are elected to actually represent no one else, for whatever reasons, whether it's quality, cost, compliance, or control. And it's such that it's obviously detrimental to the growth or any of those areas I've just mentioned,  to Waip\u0101, what accountability has the board got and what is above the board? The ombudsman was mentioned, but if we're not happy with the governance structure of the board, what do the people of Waip\u0101 have to actually hold them to account apart from the cycle of putting new representatives on?

And I suppose from where I sit, being the legal head on me, and I think I've tried to enunciate it in previous  in previous workshops and meetings, we've had to discuss things that I really struggled to get off the base one around the whole notion of ownership. And in a legal sense, I guess, for me, that means you have a right to use, a right to enjoy and dispose of it, a right to control and make decisions around it and be capable, obviously, of deriving a return off it. And I guess this model,  kind of basically flies in the face of all of that in terms of ownership. And I just really struggle with it. I'm not comfortable with it. Primarily probably because of my belligerent women legal training, but I guess it kind of goes to the essence of some of the runs through a lot of the concerns that have been expressed around how, you know, what control and influence will we be able to exert over assets that were  acquired, I guess, and owned by our community. So that's a real fundamental one for me. And thank you, Deborah, for that financial analysis. It just doesn't look quite as compelling as what I guess we'd all been led to believe. So really, really good food for thought in terms of that headroom there, the joys of being able to focus on spending money on other areas,  doesn't look quite as rosy as potentially it looked at first glance.

I've listened to the conversations today, but one of the key issues I keep coming back to is that we're being asked to make decisions without data or even accurate analysis. We are being told that all of this is to be developed. And this actually worries me because good decisions are made by good, accurate information. And they are not getting accurate information. We're being told that this is being developed.  We look at the Scottish issue, and I will say something. Fine, Scottish water was quite well-designed. However, their wastewater is an absolute disaster. They still have wastewater at this point in time going into their estuaries. So these things are not being emphasised. We've got to have, to us, to make a decision, accurate information. And we need to know what our representation laws are going to be, what climate laws we're going to have,  what we're going to have to comply with, because we've got businesses in Te Amuru that rely on water to be able to produce their product. And if they have no continuity and no knowledge of what we are going to get, I feel, and what the charges are going to be, they won't be competitive. The final thing I'd like to say is that just remember in this 22 councils we deal with, we've got three or four big cities.

And  I suppose in terms of when you look at the problem that we're trying to resolve, and that's obviously improving water, drinking water standards and the environment. But the solution from the DIA seems to be just keep  the local government model going, but just make it bigger. And we're going, wrapping everybody up into Entity B into one organisation covering 22 councils, but there's no change in their focus. They're still just delivering water and sewerage and stormwater.  excuse me. So effectively, the solution is really just is scale is all they're focusing on rather than the problems that we've got. So  And then you start to ask yourself, well, we're going from 67 local bodies down to four. We're looking at price harmonization probably within each of those four entities.

So are we actually just reducing the number of areas down, but not actually solving the problem that we've got?  And I just think along the same lines as Lou is that we're not actually getting good information and designing a system that will resolve those problems. We're just amalgamating  into 22 down to one and creating a convoluted structure to try and deliver what the local bodies are doing at the present time. And I fully acknowledge that there are some local areas, territorial areas that are going to struggle because of their size and inability to fund the improvements that are going to be required. But  the solution of just amalgamation isn't necessarily the only option. And in the past, government subsidies and grants have certainly filled that gap. So I'm still really just struggling with the principles of centralization versus the democratic rights of local bodies or local areas to determine their own destinies. And  acknowledging that there might be some savings in scale, it doesn't actually acknowledge what the costs of getting those savings are to the local communities. So it's the general principles that really I struggle with. So it's just my comment for what it's worth. Claire.",

Like, I understand that procurement is going to be one of the big savings, you know, like being able to finance on a large scale and then getting, I presume, large scale contractors to do the procurement.  and that's based on the Scottish outcomes. But, you know, it was mentioned in the Castalia reports that you can't assume that we will be able to access those larger-scale savings, yeah, from a procurement point of view. And I think it was also touched on in the Farriers' Ware report, too, that that should be looked at closely. And what I did mention at a workshop is it'd be good to get a New Zealand example  where you've got a large scale procurement operation that has delivered the scale of savings that we're supposed to be able to achieve in the waters area. And you'd think that perhaps NZTA might be an example or even Watercare themselves. And was it possible to sort of reduce those unit costs to get the level of savings that are being sort of  forward yeah by this analysis yeah I mean that is a big gap I guess not because we seem to be relying on the Scottish model but you'd think that there'd be some examples here in New Zealand that we could use to give us some assurance",

Recently delivered a plant in a record time in terms of water treatment plant and for a cost that was significantly less than expected. So  So it's probably emerging, but I think there are some really great efficiencies being achieved from that, you know, very smart procurement people. The supply chain really benefits from a certainty of long-term work. And so that scale was something that that brings as well. So then it's a matter of balancing sort of that local suppliers and the big players to make sure that you've got long-term sustainability in the market.

In fact, the results of the survey are always reported in the annual report. But as councillors are aware,  Our ANGRA report has been delayed this year just to audit stability, to actually come and do the audit. They haven't been able to commit the resource, so this time around we're actually running a little bit ahead of the ANGRA report. But look, you've seen the survey results. They've been circulated in the last week or two.  So what this is about is George just basically working us through some of the high points. And I guess some of the concerns that at face value come out of those survey results. So without further ado, I'll hand over to George just to take you through a few slides.",

    "text": " Cool, thanks Ken. And just to say Hannah is also here and is available to answer questions at the end too. So as Ken said, you've obviously received the survey results, but I've just got five or six slides that I want to go through just to pick out some key points and messages. So if we could just keep questions to the end after I've done that would be great.  So as Ken said, I think this is the fifth year that we've done this format of the survey and it focuses not just on services and facilities, but it looks a lot at reputation, which includes things like leadership and trust and decision making etc.  And it's a piece of quantitative research, so there is a margin of error associated with it, and you'll see through the report where they do red and green to show you where there's actually been significant changes. And probably the other thing I do just want to say is it's quite shallow and broad, so it's meant to be broad stroke so that if there are areas that want to be examined more closely, they can be done so through other measures, other means.  And it's also just part of the LTP performance framework as Ken alluded to in regards to the annual report. This is just one part of our performance framework and we have lots of other other means to to indicate a more holistic performance picture. So if I just, I think it's really important to start off with context. So the surveys carried out four times over the year and the report that you see is a consolidated annual report.  And so just to set the scene, so obviously there were some challenging consultations and conversations occurring with the community over the second half of the year. There was also some sector wide discussions that were going on in regards to Three Waters RMA reforms.  and local government review. And just setting the context, there were trends in that second half where there were dips. So what is seen within the report is, I guess, somewhat aligned with what was happening in that second half of the year.  Just in regards to just pulling out some key findings to refer to. In the context that I've just outlined, it really is still a positive result. There were some significant dips in reputation measures, but again, just consider the context.  The reputation benchmark is still in a good range, and when we look at it benchmarked against our peers, we're still acceptable and we're still good. Likewise, the percentage of residents, so champions of council, remained quite consistent with last year and previous years.  And the majority of services and facilities did not dip and there were some increases in some areas. So really the significant dips that we're seeing were in the reputation measures, considering the context of the situation. And we can talk about that a little bit more in a subsequent slide.  I just wanted to touch on this. So the survey looks at a number of things, and there are three key levers that drive the overall performance score. And so they are value for money, reputation, services and facilities. And so where I've got those red circle on that slides,  That indicates how much influence those results have on the overall performance. So if I was to pull, for example, the reputation lever, it would significantly impact overall performance. If I pulled the services and facilities lever, it would have less impact on overall performance.  So this becomes important to understand, I guess, in the presentation that counsellors and the leadership team can use the information for, and it points us in certain directions. In regards to that reputation, it's 55%, so that is the one that is influencing the overall performance the most, and that's including three key things. It's around leadership, trust and perceptions of financial management.  Value for money has previously always been the highest lever, if you get what I mean. But it's still very important, but it seems to have dropped and the reputation lever seems to have increased.  And just looking at our peers, so you've received a benchmark report that is consistently being seen across the benchmark councils as well. So those dips in the reputation side of council. The benchmark report that you received include 11 district, four city, and one regional councils, and they're councils that use the same research provider and have the same methodology. Therefore, we can compare the results.  And I guess you can take comfort that other councils are experiencing similar challenges. So there are similar impacts on reputation profiles within that benchmark report. And Waipa can take comfort in the fact that they're sitting in the middle of the pack.  So we're not overly high, but we're certainly not low either amongst our peers. If you have a look at that engagement and consultation benchmark, probably against our peers has been impacted the most. And again, we refer back to the context at the time in terms of the challenging  conversations that were happening with the community. And actually, when you look at that benchmark report, we're perceived somewhat higher in some areas than those benchmark peers, for example, across some of the water supply and roading infrastructure measures. So that, I think, gives a level of comfort as well in terms of heading in the right direction.  And just before we get onto a discussion and questions around the results, I just wanted to say what they're actually used for. So they're used to inform decisions and communication, and I guess these results do validate to some extent the work programs and planned levels of service in the LTP. They don't indicate that  indicate that that program of work is not heading in the right direction. The other thing that we use the results for is monitoring the impact on community outcomes and levels of service of the work programs within the LTP. So this survey is a really important part of the LTP performance framework, and it also provides areas where Hannah's team can look to focus on, so around the strong communication engagement plans for high risk projects.  The other thing I did just want to touch on too was the fact that these results have really informed a couple of key things in the last little while. So we've just gone through a process of reviewing Council's top risks. And one of the things that has sort of emerged and is now on the top risk  within our top risks is around how we respond to customers in the community in regards to council decisions. And that risk directly links back to some of the results that can be seen in the survey and the impact, I guess, on the reputation.  So how do we manage the response around those council decisions? And it's also informed the development of an org KPI for this year, which is looking at more communication around council's brand and reputation. So previously, we've really focused on a value for money story, whereas this is quite a shift and it's looking more holistically around council's brand and reputation.  So that's probably just where I want to leave it and open it up for discussion. I do just want to add that  The councils that have this particular survey performed are also experiencing the same challenges and seeing the same trends. There are a couple of additional questions that are going to be added to the survey going forward, and they're about sentiment. So understanding in a broader sense what those residents are feeling in regards to quality of life in the area in general, just to help inform what those trends are doing over the next 12 months.  So I'll just leave it there and open up for discussion and questions.",

    "text": " Yeah, thanks, Nadine. You did an incredibly interesting survey, this. And I've noted all of your points about the comparative and benchmarking with other authorities that are using a similar survey. I suppose when I look at something like that, I try to look for trends over time. And it's really interesting.  And I'm not saying this out of criticism, but of reality. There's about 50 monitors within the survey. And you use the time series. And the time series is 2019, 2022 or 21. So basically a three year. And I've actually looked at the percentage movement from that 2009 year to the current year.  Now, to me, out of those 50 monitors, three went up, one there was no change, and 46 went down.  of those, the average was a 20% drop. Now, that doesn't indicate that there's something more at play there. There's another factor, because our district is so varied and so diverse, so many different people taking advantage of different services, that there's got to be an overall influence, which is actually meant that that monitor on average  and over all of those 50 monitors actually has reduced by such a large figure. Is this because of the COVID environment that we're in? I mean, as elected members, we've possibly not been able to get out amongst the community as much as we could.  the community haven't been able to take advantage of our services and facilities as much. We've possibly been a bit more closed on our discussions in terms of all of the issues that we've had to deal with, all that have been influenced by COVID. Now I'm not  kind of totally excuse all of the variation, but I'm just wondering, and especially when it's impacted so many other local authorities, where there is something more enveloping across the whole of the country that's caused that negative movement.",

I actually wondered whether or not as a reflection of us being willing to put ourselves out there with some things that ended up being pretty controversial, you know, like the streets for people and the Te Mutu Memorial Park and that sort of thing, and that it's a natural consequence that people that disagree with that or don't think it was handled well look at  that is a failing in leadership by council or councilors. And I'm a bit disappointed. I mean, that's my take on it, George. I mean, as you said, you can't really nail it down and say exactly what's contributing to it. But unfortunately, I mean, I feel that I'm pleased we did those things because, you know, that Streets for People thing, we need to be doing something in that space. And we were  you know, we were cautioned at the time that it's a big change and people struggle with it. And I don't know whether or not it could have been handled better. I mean, we have actually changed our processes now. I think we agreed during the LTP process or the deliberations that we'd really like a joint community council committee to be overseeing that sort of implementation work, which I think  is a really good step forward. Yes, I guess what I'm saying is it looks like we've copped it, but I'd be really disappointed if Council wasn't working in those spaces where it might be a challenge, because I mean, in a way, that's where we need to be working.",

    "text": " I sometimes wonder, when people contact me, and COVID had nothing, that just gave people more time to actually think about the way things are, and that we were at home, of course we were, and we answered our phone and talked it through. Then what happened is that to take their problem to some kind of an answer,  meant some cooperation between the councillor and the staff. And that didn't always\u2014it hadn't happened between the community person and the staff. In fact, it seemed to be a little bit of a discussion that  Was it taken seriously? And I think that that's been a bit of a criticism. I also ask, does the community know who exactly the councillors are and what it is that you're actually prepared to do and what kind of a reputation do you actually carry with them? And that's where I agree with Claire's comments and other councillors where perhaps we don't spend enough time out there in our community  listening to what it is that they're saying and that's where I'm very glad that our our community board that we can take them out with us and if they're at that low level of of consultation that they need something done  that they can actually get it done. So I just, you know, what frustrates me, and I put myself in the shoes of the community, it now takes so long to get the telephone answered when you phone into council. You can wait anything up to 10 to 20 minutes  to actually get an answer and that's on the days when they're probably very busy but the point is is that you can't get through you either give up and and this is what so this is what they tell me and one day I did try it and then to actually get the reply back now I suppose my question there comes from the length of time that it gets for um for the for the for our  our staff to actually take on board what it is that the community want to talk to them about. And they're usually organizations and, you know, once upon a time we had a rule that our staff would come back to the person who was making the comment within 24, within two days. Now, I hear so many stories of where  they don't get a response back. And I've kind of, so you could say, well, those probably only come from the few that that happens with, and I accept that. But the fact that it happens at all, and also coming from the community of Kihikihi, I have to say that lifting their, lifting who they were up to a level of Te Awamutu and Cambridge,  has taken a heck of a lot of doing and they still feel, generally, the Kihikihi people just sort of feel that we were a left out community and that was actually demonstrated very clearly by the Kihikihi Urban Development Plan being left off and the only one missing out of the long-term plan and now we've got to wait to get  some kind of input into that long-term plan. It'll be very interesting to see that when that plan is put to Council, exactly what they're going to do about it, given that a lot of the funding is now allocated and he can see that they're going to have to wait for a hell of a long time before any funding comes available to do what they want to do. And I, you know, yeah, I think what I'm trying to express is that  Sometimes we have to look at the way that we approach things, that we actually have the willingness to do things, and I actually sometimes get a little bit worried about the fact that some people are instantly labeled as troublemakers, or that, oh goodness, that person's so hard to deal with,  Well, of course they are, because they're going to be adamant about trying to get their problem solved. And so these are the, I wonder if the random people that they got on the phone actually were some of those people, and they had a very good reason to say what they said. Yeah, I suppose that's my social work approach to wanting to go a little bit deeper into what it is that people are saying.  But my big question is, of course, is does the community, have they actually met their representative on council? Is there enough being done out there in the public for the councillors, councillors to understand what it is that the public are asking for? When I was reading through that report, I thought, yeah, I can see it. So I hope I'm making sense, but that's how I see it. Thanks, Jim.",

And as the standards have increased in Kihiki along with everyone else, then the prices go up and all of a sudden we haven't got any affordable houses again. So, if you  have that standard and a high standard, which I certainly support, then it has an unintended consequence that the costs will go up. So there's challenges all around.

Yeah, I think at least on this side of the district, I think one of the drivers for reputational damage  for us as a council was definitely sort of at the height of that bridge debate, which was fairly public over this way. And I think just the lack of progress that a lot of the community felt was being made, either in identification of a corridor or in any sort of decision around that bridge.  that was communicated really well so I think we did take some flak around that and a lot of the people that were involved in that are heavily involved in our community and in our workspaces and in some of our bigger workspaces so it is important some of these big decisions that we do listen and we do and I know we have acted but just how visually we've done that and how often we've done it if I just look to  trying to communicate once and how many people might listen to that one communication out in our community, it's probably a very small percentage. So, and I know we've got the website and that sort of thing, but sometimes these big ticket items or really important piece of communication, maybe we just need to look at the multiple ways we can  communicate that out. And us as councillors having a bigger influence, maybe when we're going to some of these meetings, it might be for something else. But I guess, you know, always sort of pushing those big messages. But the comms team could maybe have a look at that also. But I know that that was probably around the point of time when the survey was done.

We've got to be, it's our responsibility to be out there and working for the community. But and like also Hazel said, it is really a joint.  You know, it's the councillors working with the staff and the community and everyone working together to get that answer out there and help the community with their problems or their issue or whatever they've got to address.

But there are no other comments on any of the others, which I'm sure that there must have been some.  And secondly, the comments on the value for money, the percentage that is mentioned on that page, is that the percentage of the total respondents, 432, or the percentage of the respondents who made a comment on comments about value for money?  because there would be a different interpretation.
