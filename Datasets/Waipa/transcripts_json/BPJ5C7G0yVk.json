Firstly, we're streaming live on YouTube, and people in the chambers, I wonder if you could make sure you press your buttons before you talk so that we can hear at this end. And Zoomers, can you please keep yourself muted until you talk as well? Otherwise, things get a bit chaotic.  So with that said, let's kick on. The first order of business, as is always, apologies, I'm not aware of there being any, so I'm quite comfortable for us to move on from there, in lieu of there being anybody missing. Is Roger with us? So perhaps we should just note his apologies for lateness in that instance. Can I have somebody who's happy to move in for me, Mike?  seconded Marcus all those in favour say aye.",

Yeah, there was a minor typographical error which has been fixed, but then there's no discussion on the point that I queried about the use of the $49,000 for district promotion, because I asked for an assurance that staff would be seeking to use that fund for  events and promotions across the whole district, not simply around like Lake Karapiro and like the Avanti Drome, which is where the facilities are for large events. And I just, and I did get that assurance from staff at the time. So I was asking whether or not that could be included just in the discussion part.",

    "text": "Hello. Hello, sorry we lost you for a second there. Technology, welcome, thank you. So we're to present our annual report for the 2019-2020 Waip\u0101 Community Facilities Trust annual report. This report will be covering over the topics of the non-financial report and the financial report.  if we can go to the first slide, if everyone's on the first slide. This is the total visitors across, obviously, only the event centre this year. We're substantially down to 195,000 visits  One more page, please. Thank you. 195 down. Obviously, that's due to COVID. And you can see on the right hand side the variation of about 37, almost 37 and a half thousand people down or a loss of 16 per cent. I'd like to highlight end of February, we were tracking at 9 per cent above the previous year. So COVID's hit us as an organisation pretty hard.  So, 166,000 pre-Covid till February 20. So, we're up about 13,000 on the previous year. So, just to get another, you know, a sense of what we're up to. So, we're up about 13,000 on the previous year. So, we're up about 13,000 on the previous year. So, we're up about 13,000 on the previous year.  projected at a visited number of two hundred and fifty three thousand around there, which would have been really good in a record for us. Next slide, one's just to the polls. Down again, we've got a record of about two hundred and fifty three thousand. We've got a record of about two hundred and fifty three thousand.  Down to almost 19,000 visits or 16.8 percent, almost 17 percent. We had a number of bookings in March that cancelled due to school swimming sports. We had a number of them cancelled with the high numbers and obviously the terms going in and school holidays were affected. Next page. If we look at pre-COVID, we're right on track there.  heading into our busy months in March and in school holidays. So, we're still up a little bit on the previous year, which was our busiest year ever. But that is what it is due to COVID. Next slide. The stadium numbers. We're down about 10,000 visits on last year.  We were just kicking into our winter season, which is normally, historically, the busiest terms of the year, the six months busier in the winter codes. And once we went into lockdown, Level 3 closure and then Level 2 was pretty much only high level sport was allowed. Obviously, the magic deal. So, the visitors were down. Pre-COVID on the next slide, which is February, we're up about 2,300  Visits were 10% and then these were the 10 significant bookings that we lost, not including our general mini ball and basketball netball, but some significant tournaments that we lost due to COVID, which is a bit disappointing. Next page, next slide. This is how our gym was tracking, or Club Waip\u0101. We were pretty much on par. We were tracking really well.  quite a bit ahead of the game. So, we're almost on par with last year. Membership dropped significantly. We lost about 107 members due to COVID. So, to get them back, it's been a bit of effort coming in with the team. And the next slide, and that's how we were tracking. So, we're up almost 7,000 visits on the next slide, or 20%. So,  Because we were so far ahead, it didn't affect the overall of the gym too much. We were almost on par. But the group fitness was up and gym membership was up. The team were working really hard on that. So, you know, it's just things that happen. Next slide.  We were given $20,000 in grant funding from Water Safety New Zealand to deliver to schools for the water safety and boat safety. So, we were given $20,000 in grant funding from Water Safety New Zealand to deliver to schools for the water safety and boat safety. We were given $20,000 in grant funding from Water Safety New Zealand to deliver to schools for the water safety and boat safety.  and learn to swim program, which was going really well. Then obviously, once again, COVID hit and had a bit of problem. So, we're still above the previous year at that stage for the total year, and that was before COVID hit. So, we're well on track to break numbers. Next slide. And as you can see, that's how we were tracking pre-COVID.  So, we're quite proud of that, especially the swimming lessons for the schools was going really well. The next one is the big slide, sorry. This is the big impact. We had 268 bookings cancelled in three months, which was about 11,700 lost revenue and projected of about 58,000 visits lost. And in this current year,  when I wrote this presentation, we had 168 bookings cancelled due to the second wave and we're getting cancellations as we speak, especially with Auckland have been in lockdown three. And so some of those competitors can't leave. So they've been cancelling and keeping the hygiene and the standards. We've got gym carnivals that we can't host because they just can't maintain the hygiene levels that are required and wiping down after use and  mats are pretty hard if they're not plastic and things like that so it's probably going to affect us for a while going forward and hopefully we get back to some normality if we get lifted to level one. Health and safety next slide. So generally overall we were a doubt on all last year which is a good thing except for our contaminations  While they've come down significantly over our history of being there, this year we seem to have a number of vomits more than our code browns. So, we don't know the reason for that, but we were on ballpark from last year. Previous years, we obviously dropped significantly with our new food policy and tried to stay on top of it.  But overall, most of them have dropped. Had a few trespass from last year. Seven lot of incidents with little kids or kids not behaving. Poor water quality. Next slide, sorry. Tracking quite well, you can see we're right above the 85. Average is 94. So we're tracking well above and there's a gap  obviously April, May and June. The good thing about COVID for us was we got a chance to do our maintenance period and do a really good clean. We did a lot of tiling and all our expansion joints in our pools, which had been, hadn't been done for a while. So that closure kind of helped us out getting on top of that, which was really good. Feedback.  generally on par. We had more compliments last year. I don't think COVID's helped us any.  with that and then as restrictions are still in place I think generally people's patience you know they want things to go back to normality and trying to keep restrictions on is tough to meet their needs in some aspects but generally pretty good and down on the stuff that really matters but disappointing to lose those compliments I guess not as good.  Next page, please. Capital renewals. So, ASB Stadium, the grandstand that everyone sits in, we've got new motors or drivers to do that. There was a significant cost around the 50k mark when we got all some new pumps for some of the pools.  and we upgraded the trust, invested in the new reception. If anyone's been there lately, you'll see a nice, more welcoming reception and more inviting. And we got new lane ropes and we also did a full renovation of our sauna. So, ripped it all out, new wood, a new heating unit and the heating unit's actually got a water feed to it now. So, one of our  issues we had before was because it's a really dry place and there was no moisture the wood would actually get really brittle and so become a fire hazard over the 20 years that it's been opened and so the new water feed leaves a little bit of moisture in the air that keeps the wood damp so hopefully with us being able to on a cycle roster we'll be able to maintain and keep that going so that seems to have good feedback even though it's closed under level two.  This is and I have to stipulate that these have not been fully audited, but virtually how we're tracking is of zero. So, the funding that we received for between the two years, obviously, the last quarter with covid, we didn't receive as much funding, which is obviously quite understandable.  We had capital renewal funding and then our funding, another trade, and then you can see the government wage subsidy that we received, which was a real help. So, overall income is down and expenditure was down as well. So, our difference was about one hundred and fifty one thousand that we made a deficit before tax or surplus, sorry, surplus before tax.  Okay.",

So, the next slide is the one I've produced or we've produced each year, and it seeks to, I guess, put things in some sort of  I guess, useful information in terms of cost to the ratepayer and what the facility might be providing itself. So, line number one there, the district council subsidy, which you saw on the previous page, was $940,000. That's the surplus we made for the year. So, the overall  by, if you like, the people of Waip\u0101, 793 and a half thousand, or 42 percent of our total revenue. So, the commercial activity of the trust, along with the government subsidy, produced 1.528 million, or 58 percent of the total.  per user visit cost was subsidised by the district council or the rate payers as $4.07, a little bit more than last year. And the commercial activity of the trust subsidised at $7.83. So the total cost per visitor average across the facility, just in Te Amutu, of course, Cambridge being closed, was $11.90.  $22,541 rateable units in WIPA. So the annual cost to the ratepayer on average, top right-hand number, $35.21. And the commercial activity of the trust produced $67.82. So overall cost per ratepayer, a total of $103.03.  $35 of which subsidised by the ratepayer. And then just across the bottom there, trying to sort of suggest what equity growth the trust may have produced. And the bottom right hand number, $41.50 of, shall we say, equity across the ratepayers  in the area for 2019-20 up from $35 a year before. So just a little snapshot of things that I think are interesting. Whether you do or not, I don't know. So happy to take some questions.",

And it's disappointing that all that progress that you had been made is now is on the downward side, but we can just hope that things improve going forward. I had two questions. The first one was, I noted that there are actually a big reduction in slips and falls.  And I wondered if you might be able to sort of shed some light on that. I know that you did some maintenance, you know, on those pool surrounds in Timutu a few years ago. Is that it or is it people just being more careful?",

And our previous way of cleaning it  and the old elbow and scrubbing brush and the hose didn't cut it. So we purchased  some machines at significant cost that would be scrubbed and do it. So, we have regular cleaning on the flooring with the machines and that's really made a big difference on the flooring. So, over the past year or so, we've been tracking the slip strips and falls due to that. Not from people running, we do running as well, but just normal walking where it was slippery, how other machines are going. So,  we'll be definitely getting those type of machines for the new Cambridge pool as well, sort of thing. So it's the machines that really help. They can lift the dirt. They've got big scrubbing brushes and walk behind and scoops the water up and the dirt up as you go. No, that's really great to hear.",

And we've just been lucky enough to get the third round of wage subsidy for the two weeks. So we've just been given that this week. Yes, we also got a small business, small business loan.

    "text": " So, when we originally heard it, we were told that if we could separate areas and have separate changing rooms and separate entry and exit points, we could have 100 each side. Then we went to our industry meetings and I asked the question, was this true if we could isolate those areas? And they said, no, if it's one centre, it's 100 across the centre.  Yesterday I spoke to somebody from Auckland who came down in our industry and they said they've been separating 100 either side. So we've got to take into account our partners like the cafe. We want them to operate as well. So, you know, and they've got an allocation of about 20. We put 40 in the pool with any one stage.  and that's including the swimmers and parents, but we try to restrict a lot of the parents. So, currently, the swimming lessons are you come and drop your kid in Simon or scan in your code, you wait in your car, the kid gets done, and then we escort the kids to their parents.  trying to reduce those numbers. Once they start bringing siblings and things, we restrict it. We've got no group fitness classes running at the moment. We are re-looking at that, though, to see if we can reduce the class size and spread them out. And then we've got the gym at any one stage and the stadium. So, 100 people comes up pretty quick.  It doesn't take long, especially at peak times. So it's trying to balance that out and be fair to everyone. If we got confirmation we could put 100 either side, that helps us out a lot. But we still got to try and keep the social distancing. And if we have too many people, it's so difficult to manage and then wipe down. You think of all the sports equipment, netball goals, basketballs,  seating, flooring between use, very difficult and time consuming for staff to maintain. So, restricting it is what we've done to be able to maintain some normality in service.",

    "text": " I'm good everyone. I'll just do this awkward screen sharing thing so we can see the image and hope that it all does what it's supposed to do. Hopefully we can see that.  So hello, everyone. Dr. Jeremy Maile here on behalf of Creative Waikato, the arts development organisation for the Waikato region, and I'm joined by my colleague, Des. Creative Waikato, for those who are unfamiliar, operates independently across the Waikato region to provide strategic direction and support for sustainable arts, culture and heritage development.  We work with funders, councils, artists and arts organisations to work collaboratively to ensure that the Waikato prospers with diverse and transformative creative activity. We're the navigators who lead the elevation of our region and collaborate to provide opportunities for cultural well-being.  Let me start by saying that I believe the arts are a vital aspect of the lives of individuals in their communities. Arts and culture can illuminate our inner lives and enrich our emotional world. The arts help us to define and express ourselves as well as to engage with each other in our communities. They are powerful levers for promoting positive social change.  The arts function as the conscience of our society. They show us that we make the world rather than simply inherit it. I've been fortunate myself to be actively involved in music, theater, and various other art forms for the majority of my life. Early on as a participatory activity through various music lessons, school and community drama groups, and watching a range of performances. And now more recently as a creator and enabler of various arts experiences, as well as in this role as an advocate for the arts as an essential service.  The arts are a coping mechanism for humanity and they are central to my daily life. One of the primary reasons we make both public and private investments in the arts is for the inherent value of culture. The arts can be life enhancing and entertaining whilst also helping us to define our own identities. They have social and educational benefits as well as various economic ones.  Art and creativity are fundamental to building a healthier society, and this view is widely supported. Here in Aotearoa, New Zealand, research from Creative New Zealand shows that a majority of people believe that the arts help improve society. They say that the arts are good for you, and the evidence states that arts contributes positively to our economy as well as our society. And it is through continued support and investment that many of our young people and emerging artists are able to get their start in this vital field.  Creativity can encourage civic engagement, build resiliency, and contribute to quality of life. More and more studies are highlighting the positive outcomes that art and creativity can have on community and well-being, and it is exciting for me as someone who's involved in the community.  to see various artists and arts groups creating opportunities for people to engage with arts on all levels and that there continues to be support for them from people who recognize that the value of art is well beyond the price tag and that engagement with art and art making processes is vital. Arts engagement offers various social benefits including being part of the treatment for mental health as well as encouraging self-confidence and self-esteem.  As part of the COVID response, we've seen an upsurge in creativity and engagement in the arts. Arts has served as a coping mechanism, a tool to come to terms with our situation, to find solace, to find connection, to find peace. Art is a powerful and transformative element that should be at the core of any recovery work, as well as a fundamental part of society.  Arts engagement has shown to increase teenagers' capacity to communicate and to learn, to relate to each other and to tolerate others, as well as making them more likely to vote. Increasingly, such benefits are presented not as happy byproducts of artistic activity, but as part of its very essence.  So what is the impact of access and investment in the arts in a community? There are countless benefits. The arts increase people's capacity for life, they enrich people's experiences, and they provide powerful applications outside of the artistic experience. Art testifies to the power of the human imagination.  the unique capacity we have to dream. Art tempts us to move beyond our perceived boundaries and limitations to explore a curious and creative new world of possibilities. And I'm convinced that if we have more people engaging with art, the world will continue to be a better place.  But in order for art in the community to thrive, it needs support. The investment you can make as a council can enable a broad range of things. And this investment means having spaces to present work, having people to help make work, having access to materials and technology, to craft work, and having a range of audiences in your own district.  to engage with this work. All of these things are vital to help keep a functioning and beneficial artistic culture alive. Through the arts, we're reminded of what more there is left to do in the world. So why are we here?  We're collectively dealing with a unique and traumatic period of unexpected change. We're in a time of recovery, and we need to take this moment to explore what opportunities are emerging and how we can activate them. What we're talking about is a continuation of the Waikato Arts Navigator. This is a framework developed by Creative Waikato that is available to all councils in the Waikato region. Its goal is to build a collective vision for arts and creative outcomes for all our communities.  The ultimate objective of the Waikato Arts Navigator is to have all councils in the region making decisions for arts at development with the following outcomes in mind. Creative prosperity, creative experiences, creative well-being, and creative excellence.  We know that the Navigator aligns itself with the long-term plan, and we find that arts-based methodologies can support the vision that you have as a council. We see that the arts and culture are part of the bigger societal ecosystem, one that brings cultural practices into spaces and places and develops outputs which lead to positive outcomes and clear benefits for community. You can see a map of that in your report.  We also know that an arts-informed lens is applicable to all elements of the work that you do. There is a way to explore how an arts-based understanding can be applied to the community and the way that we can collectively enable the establishment of a clear and engaging sense of identity, both within each district and ultimately for the broader Waikato.  In the earlier phases of the Waikato Arts Navigator, we completed some research in the community, examining strengths, capturing a picture of what exists and where the strengths are within your district. This work was originally developed in 2019. It provides a picture of where things sat pre-COVID and showed that there is an arts-aligned community within your district.  This is a community that can be supported and enabled to reach out more, to develop their own capability and to increase their engagement with the broader community. And these are some of the areas where the strengths lie.  In a recovery environment, there are going to be some issues, some challenges to address. Economic downturn, physical and mental health, and increasing inequality. But with this, there are also opportunities to see the call, to explore your own backyard, to buy local and to support local. And through arts activity, we can provide an extended process for that kind of engagement.  Arts can serve the community in a range of ways, and artists can be the first responders, and Creative Waikato is here to help. We have a pathway for you to work with us here around providing some strategic vision and project planning that can enable more of this work to happen within your community and by people in your district. The pathway, which is presented in more detail in the report, has us working together to explore opportunities and solutions, activating a process, and then collectively enjoying the outcomes.  The scope for this work is extremely flexible and scalable. It depends on the vision that you have, the scope of the outcomes you wish to enable, and the scale of the budget that can be applied to it. As part of this, we want to just take a little bit of time to outline some of the examples of this type of work that has happened elsewhere. And these are all examples that could definitely be made to happen within your part of the world. Des will talk a little bit about this.",

Now this particular example is the Yopishi Festival, which means let's do it in Japanese. So it was driven by a Japanese art collector who took a whole lot of artists back to her hometown in Ofunato, which is in the northeast of Japan.  So obviously it was devastated by the 2011 tsunami so she just wanted to look at art solutions as a way of bringing her community together. So this particular example is of a makeshift playground for children but they also had  Things like Dream Shopping Street where people could write handwritten notes and their dreams and wishes for the future. They could light lanterns, receive massages, listen to local stories and it was just a way of galvanising people together in quite a traumatic time.  This particular example is from Seattle. It's actually called Shun Pike. It invites a series of artists to show their works in empty storefronts. So it's a way of art really reaching out to passersby and bringing the community together as well. It encourages an arts ecology and also local entrepreneurship.",

    "text": " This was a post-COVID initiative to encourage more activity in city centres.  There's also opportunity for performance festivals. This could be multiple bands. It could be single performers. It could be buskers. You will have seen some of this taking place in your district through the Best Fest initiative, which we ran a few weeks ago, which was throughout the Waikato region, which had performers performing in the streets just to inspire and encourage community well-being. This is from a festival in Wellington.  We have the opportunity to create works that take over public spaces and these could be pop-up installations that can be really community focused and participatory and there are a range of examples of this that happened in Christchurch post-earthquake as well.  This is from a group in Santa Fe, which is a group called Meow Wolf, and they do immersive art installations. They take over empty buildings and commission artists to create work that becomes an artwork that you can move about inside. It's a huge business for them in terms of economic development and tourism. And there is plenty of talented artists within the region who can do this type of work.  This is an image from the Boone Street Art Festival. The Boone Street Art Festival in Hamilton was initially kind of started in response to the CBD being empty because shops had moved out to the base at the north end of Hamilton.  and so it was a way of reinvigorating what was going on in the city and that festival's been running for five years has done a number of walls and has increased the kind of vibrancy within Hamilton and this is the type of work that can certainly happen anywhere and this is an image from an installation like the Meow Wolf work that occurred in an empty  building in the CBD in Hamilton as well. This was a kind of pathway through that had six different zones with six different artists creating work.  So the arts inspire, challenge, and expand our minds. They engage our creativity and allow us to experience the world through someone else's reality. From education to wellbeing, to quality of life, the arts are crucial to our success, health, and happiness. Each generation has its own unique set of challenges, but it is through the arts that we learn compassion, curiosity, understanding, and critical thinking skills that enable us to address problems and to find solutions.  Successful recovery is about defining clearly, focusing locally, spending social capital, and creating compelling narratives. It is first and foremost about people and places, not processes and policies. The arts can serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.  the arts can be a catalyst to affect such change and through the Waikato Arts Navigator and the strategic support of Creative Waikato this can happen in your district as well. So we very much look forward to working with you to explore the possibilities of what arts can do in this time of recovery. Thank you.",

I've got some comments to make myself but let's just see if we have anybody else who'd like to ask you any questions or make some observations. Have I got anybody in the chambers who may have a comment? Nobody there. In Zoom land have we anybody  here, no? Okay, well, I'll launch ahead, you know, look, I'm really excited, particularly about some of the suggestions in terms of project examples you've raised around street art and murals, something that the Te Umat\u016b Community Board has been discussing for some time, and it's actually on our strategic priorities for 2020 to 2022 already. So look, lots of synergies, if you like, in terms of your thinking around place shaping and sense of  identity and self and the things that we are hoping as a community board to be able to facilitate the creation of and from a personal sense I've actually posted several posts on Facebook grapevine pages asking people what they feel is about looking at certain items and in particular the Jeremy's painting on wall mural on the side of the former or the museum there and people's response is nothing but positive and there is  there is nobody that finds, that I could elicit anyway, any negativity. So long as it's something that's invigorating and uplifting and has purpose and identifying, I think people would wholeheartedly support. So that really, really excites me. So many thanks for that. And I've got a couple of other comments around the work you've done in terms of the Waip\u0101 district profile. There were a couple of things, a dance company you missed,  Imperious Dance Company, have you dealt with, are you familiar with them? They're in Te Omutu, very successful.

The next step is we're going to develop a  a regional art strategy that aligns with the framework that we hope will be adopted by all councils so that we're all working towards the same goal. And then it's about working with you and those groups to uplift their strength, so enable them to do more work in their community, to find more funding, to connect with their community. So it's a little bit about us  working with you and them to uplift where those strengths are. Because Creative Waikato is not a funder, we are a strategic organisation that does capability building. We work with groups to kind of help to facilitate those connections. And so there are some opportunities like the Ng\u0101 Toi Arohi Fund, which is a Creative New Zealand fund that just opened yesterday, I think.  which is for arts in the region. So it's Creative New Zealand funding for arts projects that happen anywhere other than Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. And it's for projects of up to $150,000, providing that they have partnership funding from other organisations or councils.  So artists in the community can identify key priorities and work in partnership with groups within the district to apply for that funding.",

We did workshop it with you, I believe it might have been earlier this year. Seems like a long time ago. We've had a lot going on since then, you know, especially in terms of timeframes, not least because of COVID-19 and the impact that that's had sort of across the country.  So what we put before you today for approval to take to the community is the result of, actually, years of work, not just from Council staff, but also from Dave and his team at Boffa Miskell and also Tonkin and Taylor.  who we brought in to do the technical assessments that sit behind this draft village concept plan. And we've also engaged with Waka Kotahi, a New Zealand transport agency, representatives from the Ministry of Education. We've also met several times with the Ng\u0101 Hanap\u014duri community group. And there are some other key landowners there as well that we're also, you know, we have been engaging with on a regular basis before any of this sort of wider public engagement.  And sort of, I guess, the last point I'd like to make around engagement prior to this wider public engagement is certainly around iwi.  We have been to Ng\u0101iwi T\u014dp\u016b a few times, and they've also nominated a representative who I'll be meeting with this week, Haup\u0101ipuki, about this project as well, because we really want their input as partners in this project.

Prior to my first term, over six years ago now, the excitement was there at Ng\u0101 Hana P\u016bri to get going with this project.  and it was really from my recollection was based around option two which was a staggered intersection and that was  kicked into touch, I suppose, because of the cost. They're not affordable. But I see that that's not the option that's being favoured now. We're actually favouring a more expensive option. So I hope that when we get to the end of this consultation round, we've actually got a project that we're going to move ahead with, because it's certainly pretty embarrassing going to public meetings at Ng\u0101 Hinep\u016bri at the present time.  But the real question I have is what feedback have we had from the school? Because my understanding, and it's only anecdotal, is that it's full now. They're short of space. And this development is just going to increase the pressure on the school. And yet there's no provision for or capability to actually extend the size of the school grounds.",

They really love their school. It's a real focal point for that community, and they really want to see that school expanded. So that's why we've got the Ministry of Education involved, acknowledging that Council doesn't have jurisdiction over that property.  or any decisions that happen in that school. So we've been working with the ministry on that. Now, the messaging from the ministry has been that they expect the school to manage down the number of out-of-zone students that they have. And the ministry's preference would be, if there was going to be any expansion, is that it wouldn't actually move south and therefore require moving of that road reserve.  So it's a bit challenging. It's another one of the challenges we've faced in this project in terms of council's jurisdiction that we actually have is quite limited in this area. And we are limited in terms of what we can do in response to things such as the school expanding.",

And because the ministry haven't picked up on the fact that it is likely to need expansion of that school,  The only other option that we've got is the option five, which is an offset roundabout, which would create a bit of space, unless we go with the staggered intersection that we had originally. So I'm just a little bit nervous about us just accepting the ministry's view and trying to control school numbers there by keeping the out of zone kids out of the school. And I don't know if Mike's got a comment how easy that is to do.  but it's a popular school and there's a huge amount of development going on around there. And we're going to look real chumps at the end of the day if we give an option that actually hems that school in.",

I guess I am quite worried about it. So my understanding, and I'm really interested to hear from staff what the recent conversations are around this. So my history, if I recall correctly, that there was a willing landowner opposite the school who was happy  to work with council and provide land and things. Now that land has been sold. We have a new landowner now who has an entirely different plan. None of these plans is what I understand, none of these plans is what he is thinking about at all. He doesn't want a road there at all anymore.  So I guess my question is, where are those conversations at? Because I'd hate to be putting out a plan for public consultation that isn't even relative anymore, isn't even up to date. And that's what I'm kind of hearing and that we're actually behind the eight ball here. So sorry to put that, throw that on you, but I just heard that on Saturday.

We've, you know, let them know about the multi-criteria analysis, the outcome of that, you know, being aware that we didn't want to give them too much information until it had come through elected members.  And we do actually have a meeting scheduled with them for tomorrow afternoon. They have signalled that they have some different options to put on the table. And, look, last week we had some meetings internally and it was agreed that we would remain open to other options, you know, like, as you say, acknowledging that things have potentially moved on. It has been some years since this project was started.  and it is actually for that community. It is a difficult juggling act, though, isn't it, when you're working between sort of private interests?

We wanted to ensure that there was a robust process that was undertaken and that we had technical and council staff but also we had links in to the central government agencies and into that community group.  It's not our intention to go out with something that is predetermined. The purpose of engagement is to ensure that we go to the community and interested parties and listen to them, to hear their views. As Justine mentioned, we have a meeting with a landowner tomorrow and their representatives. We've had several meetings with them, but we haven't had  information shared with us, detailed information shared, so tomorrow provides the opportunity for them to put forward their current thinking.  and for them to further participate in that community engagement. We've also made it clear that we want central government agencies to be part of that.

    "text": "Yeah, look, it's just a comment, just a clarification around the comments there by Jim and Liz around the school and the sort of in-zone, out-of-zone.  Schools are zoned and that school will be zoned. And so you can take as many out of zone children as you wish as a school. And through that, you generate two things. You generate additional staffing.  So it doesn't matter if the children are in zone or out of zone. You attract additional revenue with every child. So again, it doesn't matter if the child is in zone or out of zone. However, what you do not attract is extra building space that is only attracted through children that are in zone. So I guess what the ministry will be saying is  is as the subdivisions fill up, you will manage your out-of-zone children out and there will come a point where you probably are owed buildings potentially. But realistically, the data that would be important to know how far away that is, is how many out-of-zone enrolments that school has compared with in-zone enrolments. And that will give you  in terms of current numbers, how much space there would be. And then the ministry would also, along with the board of trustees, determine how big that site capacity actually is for children. So getting those sort of figures together, you could sort of start ballparking with the ministry predictions of what a house generates in terms of primary school children.  So there's a little bit to it, but it's not rocket science. There's just a little bit to it. It's just a few questions and a few formulas that one would need to go through to look at real capacity of in-zone students.",

    "text": " Yes, thanks. Yeah, and I just like to echo Jim's and Liz's comments, you know, about how this community has really suffered with the various attempts to meet their aspirations and really wanting to get it right this time and avoiding sort of great disappointment for them. I just wanted to understand a bit more about the assumption that the school could expand into Reid Park.  because that seems to be the crux of the Ministry of Education's stance that the school doesn't need to expand south because there's heaps of space in Reid Park, which is to the west. And I don't know if the community's been...  I don't know if the community's been asked about whether or not they'd like to sacrifice the space that's in Reid Park, because I would imagine that the answer would be a flat no. And so, Justine, I hope that your project team is aware that that seems to be what the Ministry of Education's wanting, but I think that has to be made clear during the consultation to find out whether or not that would be acceptable to the community. I mean, that Reid Park was donated by a family that lost  a member of their family you know in in the i think it was world war ii i don't know but yeah it was world war ii yeah and i i just don't think that they would think that  Any part of that park would just be up for, you know, carving up and giving to the Ministry of Education, well selling I suppose, but even so, you know, you need to be sensitive to some of these things for the community. And I'm worried about the affordability of any option, given that the preferred option is $11 million.  And given that we're going to have about, well, between 400 and 600 lots that will be developed up to 2035, I mean, it's about $24,000 a hectare. I suppose that's sort of in the middle.  I understand that a lot of the sections have been sold already, so the ability to recover DCs might actually be really, really reduced already. I'm just concerned that we're taking a long time to do this, and we're missing opportunities, and it might become even more unaffordable. However, I do know that, I noted that the contingency behind the,  the figures for the cost of various options is 50% and I would have to just like to test that because I'm aware of some of the other projects that we get you know visibility on the contingency isn't 50% it's 30% or it's 20% why why is it 50% in this case because  um if it was possible to work with a lower contingency that actually might improve the affordability so so those are the three big big points I'd like to make thanks.",

I think Marty Reid is a member of that group.  and certainly was very strong in terms of utilisation of that space. We talked about possible options, including whether it was something that council could perhaps acquire. We also looked at land holding on the northern side of the school where the hall is and the ownership status of that. Unfortunately, council owns a very small portion of the car park.  Just in terms of that contingency that you refer to, Clare, so I'm aware that there has been a project business case developed for this through the 2021-31 LTP. And as part of the rigorous review work that has been recently undertaken, there has been quite a look at contingency sums. So that is something that is on our radar and we will be further engaging with elected members on that.",

Yes, I certainly agree that what I know about from the Ministry of Education, they're not the easiest to deal with, and they possibly don't want to talk at times, but I've only heard that they'd rather prefer to go up than expand. I think they had opportunities to develop this structure plan if they pushed it, but they've, up till now, shown no interest. I agree that the park would be a no-go zone, due to the historical reasons.  It does concern me that we spent a lot of time in the regitry years ago, putting N1, N2, N3 at an area of what's 102 hectares, I think, if I'm correct.  keep Ng\u0101ina pre-development on one side of the road, not because it was foreseen across the other side, the sort of hap\u014d side of the State Highway. So, we've kept it like that. There's going to be massive growth before 2050. That whole area could be filled up with houses. That's most probably the vision. So, we've got to get this right. The roundabout is most probably a good idea.  I don't think there's been any deaths now, but it's going to happen now. We've got two straight roads going straight through. So yeah, and one of my big regrets is that now the landowner has changed. We had quite a, it wasn't a complicated system to acquire a fair bit of that land at minimal cost to council. And I know the new landowner, from what I know of their business aspirations, I don't think that same deal would be on the table. So we're going to have to,  pay for it to achieve something that was achievable, you know, 10 years ago for minimal costs. But we've got to move on. I think whatever you may come up with, the entry landowners in the future, you have most probably a good idea if that road could be moved, but that's a major. I wish you good luck. And we have lost, from a historical point of view,  Mr Fox left the Prawnia Ward Committee because of the frustrations with how this progress was happening, especially in this little patch. Okay, I'm pleased that he's still running the community group because he's a good man to lead that. So I just hope this works out and there's been a lot of money spent on it. That's much to my detriment when I did bring it up that we started reinventing the wheel that a lot of this work had been done.  Yeah, I hope it does proceed, and I look forward to it if I live long enough. Thank you.",

So this is an information-only report at this stage, just to make you aware of this item that is on the Iwi Consultative Committee's agenda for tomorrow, with the expectation that it is going to come back to this committee in due course for your consideration. So I'll take my report as read. The two main issues that have been raised are, firstly, concerns as to whether the controls that are currently applied to Mount Kakapuku are appropriate.  but probably more importantly, whether the process that led to those controls back in 2015, and if not before, were appropriate. So, staff have taken a considerable amount of time to look at the options in this space. We obviously have some sympathy for these issues that are being raised. It's not as straightforward as we would  have liked in terms of working towards a resolution. Because these controls are applied by the dog control policy, the only real option we can see at this stage is a review of that policy where those controls sit. And at this point in time, that's not scheduled until 2025.  So before we look at going down the track to review the policy, we just want to ensure that there's a consensus that this change is justified, but more importantly, that we've identified any other areas of concern that may have been missed previously as well. So that's the main reason why we're referring it to the  the Iwi Consultative Committee to not only look at kekapuku specifically and whether that is a trigger for a policy review, but also if there are other areas of concern where controls either aren't appropriate or aren't in place at all, so that we can weigh up the considerations there. Because we do, on the other hand, have  other things to consider in terms of Council's obligations under the Dog Control Act. And being mindful that if we go down the path of a full review, it will open the door to any other opinions that the public may wish to present through that process. So, as I said, the matter's on the agenda tomorrow with a recommendation that that committee report back with its views around Kickapooka in particular, around the timeframe for the review of the policy  and with details on any other areas that may need to be incorporated into that process. So that's the quick summary. I'm happy to take any questions.",

I'm a little bit concerned that before we make any decisions, we really need to know  what the real issues are and what the implications are for the other reserves that we have across the district. And I can think of a number of other reserves that would equally be as culturally similar, I suppose. If you just look at Lake Nauroto, for argument's sake, again, dogs are allowed there on leaves, I believe. Yes.  And there are par sites and obviously culturally sensitive sites around that lake as well. But there will be other areas. So I think from a council perspective, we really need to know what the cultural ramifications are of dogs in these areas, because it's gonna create quite a stir if we prohibit dogs in these areas.  off a lot of the reserves that have maybe got some cultural, I suppose, history that we're potentially not aware of at the present time. So I think really that feedback from tomorrow's meeting is going to be pretty crucial. But from the correspondence and the discussions that I've had with the Kaupapa M\u0101ori committee,  But basically, they want it happening tomorrow, not in five years' time when that policy comes up for public review. So I think urgency is probably going to be one of the issues that comes out of tomorrow's feedback. So that's going to be an issue that we're going to have to deal with.  That's a lot bigger, I think, than just this one issue that we had identified at the present time. And I don't know, Porto, if you've got any comments on the issue of our dogs and cultural sites.",

So if you like that area that we're talking about has been farmed for many,  generations, I suppose, and now has been retired and formed part of the reserve. So the discussion really is definitely partnerships in terms of the Crown Reserve at the top, but is it a partnership or somebody that should be just consulted or group that should be consulted on that Pee Simple land?

    "text": " Yeah I guess watching this from a distance for a wee while, this is a really complicated matter and one where I feel that it's going to be a really difficult, the conversations are going to be difficult and I don't think we're going to see a consensus and we're going to have to make some hard decisions. So my only  I guess concern right now is that, and I'm really pleased to see this report because it's been festering away for quite a while. We follow the process, we do as much consultation and we take the time, just take the time, because I'm really worried that these, you know, those who want to see dogs removed entirely will feel that this process, you know, hasn't been given just cause. So I guess I'm just really want to be very careful and very cautious around the whole process.",

I'm not a dog owner, but I do know that there's not a lot of spaces that you can go, like around Lake Naroto or Kekapuku, that you can take your dog. That's interesting. So I think we need to have really good discussions about the use of these spaces and try and keep them open for people to use.",

So we have a recommendation there in our agenda on page 388, which is page two of Carl's report, just to receive his report there. Do I have somebody? Okay. Mike, you're happy to move? Andrew's happy to second. All those in favour, say aye. Aye. Against? Carried.  Fantastic. Thanks very much, Carl. And we look forward to hearing the outcome of the consultation committee tomorrow. Right. Now that moves us on to our 10th item, which comes under a resolution to exclude the public. So can I have somebody who is happy to move that for me? Marcus, do I have a seconder?  Roger. All those in favour say aye.",
