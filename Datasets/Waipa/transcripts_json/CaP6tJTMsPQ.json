    "text": "Yeah, yeah, so Bruce, this one I'll speak to. So, yeah, so look, yeah, the report is on your agenda, obviously, including some pretty coloured graphs at the back, an appendix one.  So, yeah, so I guess just a reminder, so we're doing this every year. In fact, this is the seventh one of these because the committee's been in existence for around about six years. And, of course, we did a baseline survey right at the start.  Yeah, the next page or two, I think it's, yeah, I guess this is the list that we keep adding to every year in terms of over the next couple of pages, in terms of the work programme that this committee's had since the beginning of its existence. And just a reminder there of what some of the key responsibilities of the committee are.  And, in fact, if you wanted a further reminder of that, the terms of reference are sitting in one of the appendixes. Now, I actually noticed, you know, when that came through that it's\u2014well, just today, I've just noticed it says draft on it. But, of course, that was not the draft. That was what was actually confirmed by the committee. So my apologies that that word draft has stayed on there.  But look, in terms of the actual survey results, I'm just looking at the observations just at the bottom of page 208. So look, I was really, really pleased when I saw those graphs, because particularly when you look at them visually, you can see that there's very much a tightening up of the result areas. There's not nearly as many outliers as what we've had in the past.  and, yeah, definitely a clear consolidation and shift of the results to the right. So that is absolutely evident from the vast majority of those graphs. And I guess, as we say at the bottom of page 208, that seems to reflect a positive impact the committee's had, and in terms of the narrowing of the results, you know, perhaps we'd  we'd be humble enough to suggest an increasing maturity in regard to the committee and the understanding of the role. Top of page 209,  Just commenting on that first bullet point down there, yeah, notice the Treasury management and insurance arrangements. Yeah, perhaps some of those scores appear to be a wee bit lower. Hopefully, in terms of the insurance, we may have started to address that with a very good presentation from Matthew this morning. But yeah, we will obviously be mindful of that.  The verbatim comments, so you can see that those are in the appendix and we've put them in raw as they came, so I would suggest a lot of those are pretty positive. But interesting, perhaps one of the  Well, one of the comments, if there was any common themes, yeah, there was one around establishing better connections between the committee and other councillors, and another one on a very similar theme in terms of greater support and risk management understanding for councillors outside of the committee. So, yeah, I guess that's chucking us a challenge.  in regard to, yeah, you know, there's, how many is there? Five councillors on board here, plus an independent chair, but obviously a number of other councillors who, yeah, perhaps it's a suggestion that they could come up to speed a little bit more, or certainly that we could, you know, we could communicate more in terms of what's happening in this space and increasing their understanding of risk.  Okay, so, look, I think that's pretty much what I was going to say. Happy to open it up to discussion. But, yeah, like I say, seems to be a good news story in terms of the results, but perhaps some comments there on the verbatim comments that we could ever think about.",

One option is that we accept what they might consider as a control risk.  But on the assumption that we accept it as valid, I think it is incumbent upon governance to monitor that those controls are actually put in place. Because after all, from an assurance perspective, part of our assurance is that we do have an appropriate suite of controls in place. So look, it is interesting. I think we did  Ken put everybody under a lot of pressure when, you know, the numbers blew out and you probably had to go on the rampage to at least find out where they were at and then come up with, I thought, I was at the last meeting of a very good  was a last meeting. A very good analysis as to where we were at with those to the point that we are today, where we could say, well, you know, essentially it's for the auditors to tick those off now, but we know we've finished them. So that was incredibly valuable exercise. So yeah, I think Clare,  I take on board your point, and I would have thought it was relatively core that when we know things need to be fixed, we monitor to see if they are.

So, yeah, so what we've seen recently and, in fact, what we've avoided for this one, when we come to my report on that very shortly, what we end up with is a whole lot of points still there. Staff believe that they've been addressed, but we are just waiting on the audit process to follow up and determine whether it can be cleared off.  So, yes, I know that causes a little bit of frustration to staff at times.

So, yes, when that goes up to Council at the end of the month, I would definitely be including the top 14 risk document. And in fact, actually, I would suggest the risk appetite statement as well.

And, you know, it's one which I just try and go with clearly where the Council has started the training and voted itself to be organised by. So it is a question of when we are a subset of the total Council, perhaps we should be more  deliberate in, for instance, exactly what you've done, what you've just said, Ken, which is agreeing that actually this is a paper that should go up in its entirety to council with it. One of those areas that we had in another committee was our quarterly report on health and safety, thinking about the due diligence obligations of councillors.  they should be seeing what we see if we are the primary receiver of that health and safety report. So that is something which I know with some of the other committees, we are thinking about being quite deliberate over what information should go up other than just the bold minutes.

So that's one point. But I think the other point this particular year is the fact that there's been quite a number of contentious issues that have taken a fair deal of councillors' time during the year. And maybe the fact that they haven't responded means that they've had a little bit of confidence in what we've been doing and they've allocated their time to the COVID consideration, the Maori ward, all of the other issues  we've had to face the capital budgeting allocation of projects. There's been a fair bit for the councillors to consider.

And I think it reflects the maturity  of the work that we're doing, and that's also reflected in the work that the the OAG has done recently on using Wipro's case study. Just to pick up on Claire's  query about the financial management policies. When I read the report, I reflected on the LTP, how volatile the current economic climate is, but also that seemed to be at odds with our assumptions as we come to understand them following the good work that we'd received from  Brad Olson and co. But equally, this was probably the most difficult LTP that I've ever been involved with, especially as we had to pull just about every single lever that we've got in order to get a balanced budget within the terms of the local government requirements, but also to get something that was  manageable for the ratepayers. So it was an incredibly difficult LTP, both from a forecasting and assumption perspective, the economic environment, which seemed to be going gangbusters at a time when our assumptions said that we wouldn't be. And altogether, it made quite a complex mix for people that really understand these policies to bring a balanced budget back before the council.",

Certainly would suggest, I mean, that would suggest there's some work that could be done, at least just now that we've got the LTP in place to just  I use that word again, it's almost as bad as direction travel, but workshop so that people understand what we're at.  Okay, look, I wonder if we, without taking it further, there are one or two things here. Obviously, Ken, there is that. Thank you, Claire, for pointing out the financial policy bit that was just spoken about, the management policies. That might be something particularly amongst your colleagues you want to focus on.  So, at the very least, as a somewhat simple suggestion, we probably are saying we should be more open to actually saying, hey, shouldn't this go as a full paper to Council so that we can try and provide that? I think we should be open to whether there are more things that we could do. Jim, I mean, your point might even be, I'm not actually recommending it necessarily that you would have a committee as the whole with the next trinium, but it may be something as you folk  in the rundown to the end of the Tronium. It's still got a year to go, hasn't it? But you know what I mean, is put away as a potential, have we got the right approach to the actual membership of the committee? But I'll leave that at the stage to your thinking. OK, can we just look at the recommendation then, please? A very helpful report can be received. I'll move that. Do I have a seconder, please?  Thank you, Claire. I'll put the motion. All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Those against? Carried. Thank you very much. Right, that's got us to lunch.  Right? Ken, we've got a very interesting paper from you, please, on our approach to deep dive rather than a deep dive, which might be a bit tiresome right at the moment. Yeah, so thanks for that, Bruce.",

I'm looking to create more structure around those discussions and create more consistency, I guess, across the discussions that we're having around the top risks. So in the report, there's really two things to focus on. One is the potential questions.  to be discussed or presented against at that deep dive discussion and two is the schedule of deep dives. Now the schedule has been discussed with the executive team and there are some elements in there that have been considered. So for example, risk 12 and 14, the timing of that has been considered based on  managing a risk earlier in the financial year rather than waiting at the end when it's, you know, managing it or reviewing the risk around it is going to be less effective. Dawn has advised for risk 10 and 11 that March would be a good time to have that discussion based around the activity that's happening in those areas. So there has been some thought in that regard to the order of them. So it's really those two points that just need to be considered by the group.",

This item came up really as a result of Ken and me having a chat, and it was sort of like,  What should we do this time? And I just sensed that actually it might be time for us just to relook at how we're going about it. So George, you have actually met the brief brilliantly from my perspective.  I do believe, this is really almost close to the previous item, we have wandered a wee bit, it's always post-lunch, but wandered a wee bit with our deep dives. And I have wondered whether, in fact, we need to just rework them. Clearly, for committees, deep dives generally are the right thing to be doing, but that we need to be a bit more exact. When we started it, the questions were pretty broad.  and we've got a range, whereas I think in my view and reading the paper, George, your six questions are right on the button and give each of these sessions much more direction  and also much more certainly both for the presenter and also for us in terms of thinking through exactly what we talked about in the earlier paper this morning, which actually looking at these deep dives, understanding the issue better and using it as a chance to understand whether our risk settings and our risk appetite  are where we want them to be. So I think that's good. Secondly, thank you for also explaining why you've got those risks in the order that you've got them, because actually it makes a ton of sense to me and I'm very happy to be guided by ELT on actually what is the order that we do them. I think the other thing, the third thing that is actually really important to me  is we do need to take the time that we should over deep dives, but then in sticking to the four corners of the six questions, it can't be quite the right thing, but the parameters of those in a discipline will help us in terms of our timing.  as well, as far as those risks are concerned. So overall, a very strong endorsement from me that actually this is the reworked way in which we should take the deep dives. Somebody put their hand up. Was that you, Claire? Oh, you have. Sorry, you got your hand up. So open. Yeah, that's right.",

And I felt that the ones  They've been programmed, they've been really relevant, actually. My only, you know, I've already raised about, I think it'd be good to have a discussion about the managing the response of the community to council decisions. And I'm hoping that that will happen in December, because I do think, I think it should be responded to earlier rather than leaving it later.  And I was thinking too about how much we enjoyed that guy from Bancorp come and talk about treasury policy, because treasury policy isn't a deep dive on this programme, but an opportunity to use that approach involving the entire council. I'm sure you'll recall that everyone that listened to him  just really got a lot out of it. And perhaps there are some of the other components of ARC's work that we could have a full presentation, you know, to the full council, because it's relevant to all the councillors really. You know, I'm kind of thinking insurance is probably another one and maybe financial sustainability too. Yeah.

This was something which I think we need to make certain we're happy about.  because actually, I always wrote against this, that's our authorising environment as a council and as governors.

So, look, what we've done, and this sort of echoes my comments earlier at the meeting, there are a large number of items.  where we believe that we've addressed the issue. We're waiting on the audit clearance, though. We reported absolutely fully on all of those at the last meeting and, in fact, congratulated Sarah on getting us to that point. There was only one item  at that point in June that we knew the work was on us rather than in order to clear it. And it was this one here that features on page 237  And look, what it is around is around network. It's an IT type item. It's about contractors having access to our networks and obviously making sure that when that access is no longer required, no longer a legitimate need for it.  that we can turn off that access. So, yeah, so Audit have raised this point. This was a point raised in our last year's interim audit, and it is an item that we are still looking at. You can see that there is a September 2021 update.  where we are looking at using a new system, actually, that we have just begun the scoping of, of implementation, a human resources and payroll system. We believe that there's merit in that becoming our central register of contractor accounts.  and then quite clearly IT would leverage off that in terms of whether a contractor was still doing significant enough work for WIPA that they needed to retain access to the system. So, look, I've got to admit that this one, particularly if we go down this path, human resources and payroll, where it's actually going to be some time in the coming,  Before we've got that system up and running, we use a totally different system at the moment. This one will probably remain outstanding for a while, but we're thinking that that is by far the best mechanism for us to use.",

So that accounts really for almost all of what was being forecasted.  in the most recent forecast last year. There was quite a lot of money, as council would be aware, that was deferred and carried forward related to growth. But just a list of the major projects, a lot of the more multi-year projects there.

So it's looking relatively good just from a cash flow point of view.

And again, one I can probably talk on when we look at my  my report in the next session, but I think there certainly are some real delays starting to be observed now, and you'll see them on the news in the building industry and that sort of thing. But even associated works for utility providers and time lags and the usual cycle activity that you would expect  to be able to plan on as part of carrying out project work. Those timelines are starting to lengthen out, and undoubtedly it's going to affect the, you know, particularly the construction phases of capital projects and lengthen them. Generally, I think there's no doubt about that.",

The difference between the current forecast and the year one LTP, some, I don't know, $26 million, is it essentially the carry forwards?  Yes, yes, that's right. OK, we're just adding to the total sum and it's the resourcing that we need. OK, that's good. Thank you. Is there any other questions for Peter at this stage on the overall performance of the state month in? Appreciate that we're starting on good discipline of having it here, Peter. Any other questions for Peter?  There being none, let's move to the resolution, please, which is that we receive Peter's report. I'll move that from the chair. Can I have a seconder, please? Thank you, Jim. All those in favour, please say, aye. Aye. Aye. Those against? It's carried. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Right. I think that might have actually got us to the end of that. And we're to item 17.  My machine just got on the blink. Can we move to the resolution, please, to exclude the public? Can you just, sorry, I'm going to have to turn my, I'm going to have to actually go in and go back out. So if you could just help me there, Jim, sorry. Thank you again. Yeah, I'm happy to second it.",
