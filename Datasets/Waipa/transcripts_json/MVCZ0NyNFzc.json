So I just want to take you through an update of the district plan work program. It is fairly full and fairly busy, and since we last met, there's a couple of updates just to bring to your attention. So I'm looking at page 17 of the agenda. So since we last met, I think the government released the National Policy Statement for Urban Development, and that has three mandatory plan changes that we have to do under that. So one is to remove all the minimum car parking requirements in the district plan.  Another one is to set housing bottom lines. So we see that as kind of minimum supply levels for housing in the district. And the third one is to do a plan change around intensification. So there's really a strong encouragement or national direction to encourage intensification around urban areas. And we have a program of work around that. The first that you'll see will be a plan change, which we're directed not to do any consultation on to remove the minimum car parking.  And we're looking at doing that in October. The next one on page 18. A little bit more, please, Tony, excluding the car parks. Sorry, what were you after some more of?",

So in our district plan and most district plans at the moment,  There are generally rules that say if you want to develop something on a site, you have to have a minimum number of car parks. And the national direction now is that we must take those rules out of plans. Part of the rationale behind that is it's kind of a bit of a mixed bag. Part of it is around freeing up some really highly valuable urban land for development rather than use of car parks.  Part of it is around encouraging and incentivizing people to get into different modes of transport. So public transport, cycling, alternatives to cars. And there will be some, you know, there'll be some impacts. It's not gonna happen. So when we put the notice in the plan and take the rules out, you won't see any immediate change. It's probably something that will come out as new developments roll through.  And there may be some increased pressure for parking on roads. If we get new developers or new developments who don't want to put on site car parking, we can't require them to anymore.",

So we have development contributions, which is what developers pay for future infrastructure. And then we have financial contributions, which is what land use and developers pay  for immediate impact, if that makes sense. The RMA was changed about seven or eight years ago to take those out under the national government, and the Labour government then repealed that change. So financial contributions are back in as of this year. In our district plan, we have Chapter 18, which means that we can impose financial contributions on resource consents that come through. And so what that allows us to do is put  the owners back on developers and applicants to help fund some of the council's infrastructure, if we can demonstrate their adverse effects. So this could be one real example where, and we can do that for offsite effects as well. It doesn't have to be related to the site. So our financial contributions could potentially allow us to require financial contributions for cycleways, if there's an impact on the road. So that's a really good question.",

    "text": "OK, so on to page 18, top of page 18. So Katarani will be well aware of this. So the government's also issued new national directions on September for national environmental standards and policy statements around freshwater management.  That primarily impacts the regional council. So Waikato Regional Council is, I guess, recipient of that to implement it. We've had a look at it and we don't think there's any direct impacts on Waipara District Council. There may be indirect ones whereby, for example, Waikato District Regional Council, if we are seeking discharge consents, tighten up some of the conditions around that. So that's something that we're still coming to grips with in terms of what it means. And we're talking with WRC colleagues around what they think it means.  There's two that the government has pushed back. So there's a National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity and there's a National Policy Statement for Highly Predicted Soils. Both of those have been deferred to around mid-2021, the Ministry have advised us. And the big one that you're probably all aware of is the RMA reform. So the Randerson report came out with some recommendations for quite extensive reform of the Resource Management Act.  The summary is all there on page 18, but it creates, if the recommendations go through, it would create three new acts. The RMA would be replaced by a Natural and Built Environments Act. The good news is, I guess, there'd be new environmental bottom lines. So across the country, we've seen various degrees of environmental management.  And so what would be established in the new Act if the recommendations went through would be hard bottom lines and the director of MFE talked about hard and tight bottom lines. So I think there's a real desire to actually put some bottom lines in. In terms of urban development, the intention there would be to do more planning up front and have less regulation through resource consent process. So we'd probably see better management of the natural resources and  simplified and streamlining of urban planning. There's a new Strategic Planning Act which would create mandatory spatial plans for the region, and we're actually well advanced in that here in the Waikato region with FutureProof. And there'll be a third new act called the Managed Retreat and Climate Change Adaption Act. And that would give councils some tools and set up a regime for better management of climate change  Mitigation as well as adaptation. And of interest to this group is also in the in the replacement to the RMA or actually separate. A recognition that there needs to be a better mechanism of iwi M\u0101ori involvement and decision making around planning. And so the recommendations set up a new national iwi advisory group.  to advise local government around iwi M\u0101ori perspectives, I guess, and increased participation. And the words that they use in the recommendation is mana whenua, so they've gone away from iwi authorities and they're starting to talk about mana whenua. So increased participation for mana whenua and RMA plans and spatial plans. So again, we're probably relatively well positioned in the Waikato and Waipa. Just look at this committee, for example, not all councils have committees like this.  and so we've probably got a bit of a lead on other councils around this, but we have some more tools that we'll be able to roll out if this all goes through. Talking to various colleagues and people and ministry officials, the feeling is that whichever party gets in after the elections will pick up the report and run with it. What we don't know is what recommendations they'll roll out and how fast they'll do it.  But everyone I've spoken to in the general consensus is. There's no desire to roll back and not do a reform, so it may happen quite quick, depend on the government appetite. They have talked about having the new acts in place in July 2022 as the recommendation, which is quite fast. But there will be a consultative process through that so.  I guess some anxiety around what it might look like, but probably some opportunities in there. And my thinking is quite an exciting time to be in this area, because there might be some really good outcomes that come out of this.",

The only thing that we do actually have in the plan at the moment is around rural water firefighting supply. And we are looking at reviewing that rule because there's some problems with it.  But we haven't extended the scope of that to include water storage in general. It hasn't really come up as a... I know we were at level 3 or level 4, I think it was last summer, which was the first time we went there.

So, you know, is there a resource concern? Is there any initiative from the council to help towards maybe someone wanting to do that? I guess looking in the future, I'm happy for whatever is coming up, I keep that topic on the table, but I'd like to bring the topic to the table about existing homes and whanau right now,  because we did a whole healthy homes situation a few years ago. We looked at warm homes, this, that, and all of that. We didn't look into the future about where the water sits. Now we are paying meter rates now, and it's not high, but the fact is to help some of our vulnerable people to be able to afford what they are going to do or what they have got, how can the council help them put in a tank?  you know, for things like the gardens or the lawns or washing their cars and all of that, that the good water supply that we're being paid for through the meter is not used willy-nilly on silly things like that. So I guess my first take is how can we help our owners today if someone wanted to put a tank in?  What's the\u2014 Look, Katarina, it is a big topic and certainly worthy of discussion.",

    "text": "And a couple of the points that you've touched on there, I suppose, are the environmental concerns and then there's the cost side of things and affordability.  And I suppose and certainly the council hasn't discussed that, but there's no so there's no formal policy on it, but there is nothing to stop somebody wishing to put in a rainwater tank in the urban centre if they wish. So, if you put the environmental issues to one side,  the absolute cheapest water you're ever going to get is through the public supply. So if you're going to put in a new tank and a pump, and then I suppose if you're going to try and use it for all of your activities in the house, then you've got to put some treatment capacity in there as well, because the new drinking water standards are going to say everybody's got to have a potable water supply.  So if you're not going to put in treatment, then all you can use it for is your gardens or flushing toilets, et cetera, which means a duplicate plumbing system. So there are  quite significant additional costs if you want to run a duplicate system on a normal residential property. And by far the cheapest option is to use the public supply. And if everybody invested anything that they were intending to spend on their own home into the public supply, there would be absolutely no need for rainwater tanks.  From an environmental perspective, there's obviously some opportunities there for, I suppose, saving water. And from an individual perspective, there's some savings, particularly over the winter period when it's raining quite consistently and your tank is always full.  In the summer, when there's a public supply, we have to design from a council point of view, that system to cope with everybody who wants to draw down water. And after a period of two or three weeks of no rain, everybody wants water from the main. So, all of our design work has to make sure that the pipes are big enough to supply the water that everybody wants in a summer period.  So, effectively, what happens is people use the water for, if you want to call it free, in the wet weather. Come the summer, when there's a demand for it, all of their tanks are dry and they want to take it out of the public system. So, there's increased costs then because we've got to supply surplus capacity over the winter. So, it's quite a complex issue. And realistically, if the rain  falls on the roof and gets discharged into the Waikato catchment without going through a rainwater tank. It's the same volume of water that ends up in the catchment, whether it goes into a tank first and then onto the gardens, then into the catchment, as if it just flows straight into the Waikato catchment.  So, it's not a simple, let's put in tanks, everybody will save a bit of water and it'll have an impact on the environment either. So, yeah, I think it's a topic that needs a lot of debate before we go trying to get people to put in rainwater tanks on every house. A lot of them can't be retrofitted. There's not enough space on the section. The sections are getting smaller. You know, it is a difficult situation.",

But it's a conversation that your table needs to look at going into the future.  for the simple reason is that they don't need to use good water for watering their goddamn garden or washing their concrete or their house or something like that, you know?

Now it's become a noun for a group of people who seem to be holding some notion of mana whenua rights. We've moved from tangata whenua  on to mana whenua. But the descriptor, the meaning of what it is that we're trying to discuss now is even lost amongst some of ourselves, because the field of understanding has moved. I don't have an answer to that as the relations advisor, because it means different things in different contexts. So I think  I'm very right to bring up that conversation and see how that's defined.

And so that's the list that we are thinking we will be in main contact with in terms of the plan change work that's coming through. Ng\u0101 Iwi Taup\u014d aren't on there, but we will engage with Ng\u0101 Iwi Taup\u014d as well as if they are one of those groups. So that's just in there to give you an indication of what thinking is around that.  So just a couple of updates. This is my last problem. The last update Jim around the plan change schedule itself on page 20 I'm on. So down the engagement column, so we've got all the plan changes on the left down the engagement column. Some of those time frames are subject to change a little bit just because of the workload and how things are panning out.  13, 15, and 16 are probably looking okay for the engagement we've got there. 17, we're still waiting for our engineers to come back with some further information on that. 18, beekeeping, that may be pushed out to October, just in terms of how that's tracking. And plan change 19, so that is rezoning of, it's a Hautapu industrial,  growth cell and part of it still remains in rural zoning. So we've got some consultants working on that and because of budget constraints and adjustments, we're getting that to a certain point and then holding on that and that will be deferred into the 2021 financial year. Papak\u0101inga, so we've got a heap of work that we're getting through and we're making some good progress on it. That's one of the next ones on our list to start scoping up.  and talking to whoever we need to talk to to start working that up into what do we do with this? What does it look like? And the last one down on the list there, the ND, which stands for National Direction, National Direction 1, that's around the minimum car parking. So that's where we don't have to consult.

An introductory leader's already gone out to our key contacts to say that we're doing this piece of work to make sure everyone's aware that we've got a plan change program. That'll be followed up by each of the individual plan changes. We might try and bundle those up to make it easier.  Once we get that feedback in, then we start drafting up the plan change and under the RMA we have to do a policy analysis which is under Section 32 of the Resource Management Act. Once we've got that, a draft plan change in Section 32, at that point we'll take it to our Strategic Planning and Policy Committee, give them a heads up,  Then we will take it back out to the iwi authorities again and say here's actually a draft that we'd like to notify. Do you have any feedback, any comments, anything you'd like to add into it? That feedback comes back in, then we finalise it and then the last action there is public notification.

So that's why I'm appearing before you today to present this report. So in opening, I'd just like to confirm that  The Strategic Planning and Policy Committee were made aware of this issue yesterday as well. So they are ready for any recommendations that may come from your committee going forward. So I'll take my report largely as read. Hopefully, it's provided a summary of the issues that have been raised with Council. And that's generally the question around whether the existing controls on Kakapuka and Maunga are appropriate.  But probably more importantly, whether the processes that led to those controls were correct or were followed and what we need to look at going forward to resolve this issue. So staff have taken quite an amount of time to explore the issues and the possible remedies that may exist in the space.  And where we've ended up is that the only real option is to look at Council's dog control policy, because that's where these controls come from. That's the source of where the dog prohibited, dog on lead areas come from. And at present, that policy isn't scheduled until 2025. So the committee, the Policy and Planning Committee will be looking for some direction on that timeframe and what may be needed through that process.  So if we go down that road, then the other part of it is that we want to make sure that we've captured any other sites that may be of concern or of interest as well. So we need to just be mindful that once the policy review starts, it's the full public consultation process that will open the door to everybody's ideas. We want to do so.  We want to do some work up front to make sure that any other areas are captured in this early stage. So I'm interested in some of Tony's comments there about how there's already a process of identifying some sites that may have interests or concerns, so we can have a look at that as well.  And the other aspect we have to consider is that we need to balance it with our statutory obligations under the Dial Control Act, as well as to why that policy is in place and what it requires Council to do and not to do. So that's really the quick summary. We want to resolve this matter going forward, but we just cannot identify any quick fix that's going to  to satisfy the concerns that have been raised. So obviously the process needs to start somewhere. So that's why we've brought this matter to this committee today. And yeah, be keen on your thoughts and feedback.",

Dogs can be in an area, but they have to be on a lead, or they can be in an area that can be free roaming with dogs or for leads. So basically what the law says is that if a council doesn't make an area prohibited to dogs and it doesn't make it free  off-lead area for dogs, then by default, it becomes an area that's dog-on-lead. So this particular piece of land has been dog-on-lead because neither of those other two options have been applied.

And I'm just thinking immediately about Kakipuku, Lake Nauroto, and yesterday we even had comments about Lake Te Kootu and the feeling about dogs in those places.  And so, Council, I suppose, made decisions without taking into account those cultural perspectives. And when you look at our dog control bylaw, there are dog prohibited areas for a lot of, for argument's sake, cemeteries.  Now, the public has said they don't want dogs in cemeteries, but nobody came back and referred through to the Urapara and things like that and other sites in some of these other areas. So, effectively, we've worked through a process and decided through public comment  where people can take their dogs and where they can't. And I suppose, realistically, the public, and there's a lot of people with dogs out there that want to take them for a walk. So when we open this up, we're going to get a lot of debate from people who say, yes, we want to take dogs in these areas.

I think we'd sent a letter to council informing them that we'd never ever been informed that it was going to be a recreation reserve.  And one of the things that we talked about way back then, 2009, was why couldn't it have been changed to a scenic reserve, the same as the one that DOC has. I think it's a scenic reserve, but to have the same classification as that, rather than as a recreation reserve. I mean, way back then, I think we've seen some stuff to Tainui, but we didn't really get any  replies around that. So we'll just leave that there. But this has been going for a few years now. I think we were first approached for some support from the Kakapuku Conservation Committee. They were concerned. The concern was that often people go up there with their dogs off the leash.  And then they don't stop there because they really want to get to the top. So they don't leave their dog tied up down below. They take their dogs up to the top, right to the top.

    "text": "Okay. So, yeah. Kia ora katoa. I'm Haven Walsh. I'm in the strategy team with council. I've been here about two years and I'm here to give a bit of an update on how council is looking to be a strategy led organisation.  and how that's primarily delivered through the long-term plan. So I'll just try and click through there. So yeah, we'll talk about those two things. And then if anybody's got any questions that they come up, I'm happy to try and address those at the end.  Normally, Kirsty Downey, my manager, who you may or may not have met previously, would lead this presentation with me. But today, well, unfortunately, she had other commitments that she couldn't get to. So I'll be the one taking us through this. So in terms of becoming a strategy-led organisation,  The council's developing the foundations so that it can work with its communities and elected members. And the council can lead with purpose and have a clear line of sight from what we do on a daily basis back to the vision or what we're trying to achieve as a council. So important to that is developing what we're calling an integrated strategic planning framework. So I'll get to that on the next slide, but it kind of just tries to articulate how  everything we do links back to delivering on that vision. The reason that we're doing this is because we're trying to, we've had a lot of changes go on in the district, and we want to be able to plan and provide for growth in those changes in a way that is collaborative, efficient, effective, and maybe take on a more facilitative role. So yeah, that all really starts with having a real clear vision and community outcomes, or  a vision for the district and the community outcomes in terms of what we're trying to achieve and how we're trying to shape the district. So what we've done is we've gone out through a bit of a process to work with our community and check in on that vision and community outcomes. I think it's fair to say that the current ones we've had for a while, I think it was originally developed about 12 years ago. And a lot of the strategies that inform the work we do, they were also developed about 10 years ago.  So we've kicked off a process to check in on that vision, check if it's still right, and then figure out the priorities for the district and redevelop the strategy so that when we work through our projects and come up with our ideas, we know they're aligned with what the community is seeking. And having that all in place will ensure that everything we're doing does give effect to the vision.  It's not intended that we're gonna achieve this all overnight. What we're doing is trying to lay the foundations so that over the next three or four years, we can deliver an LTP in 2024. That is what we're calling the transformational LTP. But we'll get to that a bit later in the presentation. So I did mention the integrated strategic planning framework to try and just show how all this links together.  So at the top there, you'll see the vision. So council's vision was at the top there, Waip\u0101 home of champions, building the future together. Then we've got the second layer down, the community outcomes. And then the third layer below that is the external strategic priorities. So those kind of set the council's strategic direction. The first two, the vision and the community outcomes are kind of longer term tenure.  the longer term 10-year visions that we're trying to achieve, and then the priority areas are what we're focusing on every three years. So we review those when we prepare each long-term plan. Below that is all the key strategies and plans. And then we've also got internal strategic priorities that are reviewed every year. And then  Below that are kind of the mechanisms that give effect to all that. So things like the long-term plan, the district plan, yeah, our JMAs, those kinds of things. All right, so in terms of the long-term plan, we already have one. This is our current one for 2018 to 2028. We're currently reviewing that to have a new one for 2021 to 2031. So although they're 10-year documents, they do have to get reviewed every three years.  So I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with this already, but I'll give a bit more detail about the long-term plan and what it is. So its purpose is simply to describe the community outcomes that council is looking to achieve, detail all the activities and services that we are providing to give effect to those community outcomes and visions. It seeks to give a long-term focus. So yeah, it's got all the projects that we're gonna be involved in for the next 10 years.  But it's also got longer term thinking in there in terms of the infrastructure strategy. So that kind of talks about how we're going to manage all the infrastructure throughout the district for at least the next 30 years. But some of that infrastructure is quite long lived. And if we look after it well, it could last in perpetuity. So it does try to take quite a long term focus.  And when it's prepared, it tries to provide for integrated decision-making. So this is when all the budget managers work together, figure out what projects we need to put in there to give effect to the vision, and look for ways that they can dovetail on each other so that there's a sort of efficiency. So if there's a project happening in a certain space, it would be good for, say, the roadie manager and the parks manager to both be across where that's happening and when,  and see if they can deliver it in more of an efficient way. And of course, the long-term plan is a key kind of document that gives accountability, that the community can use to see accountability from the council. So it says what we're going to do, and it gets checked in, and they can use that to see if council has actually done what it says it's going to do. So in terms of the planning cycle, I mentioned  Previously, the long-term plan gets reviewed every three years. In between that three-year cycle, there's an annual plan that's prepared. And if we're significantly deviating from what's in the long-term plan, then there'll be a consultation process. If there's not much changing, then there may not be a consultation process as part of those annual plans. And at the end of every year, there's an annual report that's audited. Yeah, so there's a bit of this long-term plan cycle.  Where are we at with our current LTP? So back in 2019, key staff met with elected members and agreed an approach for preparing the current LTP. It recognized that the current one is quite ambitious. There's a lot of work going on to try and account for all the growth, putting in core infrastructure, and it's quite a full LTP.  So the agreed approach was essentially to carry that over for the next three years as much as possible. Of course, there'll be new things coming in as they always do, but in essence, try and just carry over the current LTP as much as possible and try and set ourselves up to develop that transformational LTP in 2024. So with that in mind, we have agreed with elected members to maintain the current levels of service. So everything council does in terms of running its libraries,  looking after the roads and water. We've agreed to try and deliver the services at the same level. So they shouldn't be delivered to a higher level or a lower level, just continue with the current levels of service. We've engaged with the community on the vision, the community outcomes and those priorities. And I'll talk to that a bit more shortly. And we're also currently attending Hui with Mana Whenua throughout the district. Yeah.  So in terms of engaging with the community on the vision, the community outcomes and the strategic priorities, we've we've primarily done that through a series of neighborhood barbecues throughout the district. So there were there were six scheduled, but unfortunately,  Two of them got impacted by the COVID pandemic, and we couldn't have the one that was scheduled to happen at Ohaupo or the one for the balloons over Waipa event. But we did hand out thousands of sausages through those events and a lot of survey forms to try and garner the community's feedback on what their aspirations are for the district and what they want council to focus on in the coming years. And we've used that to reframe our vision, our community outcomes,  and our priorities so that we can set ourselves up to try and deliver those. So yeah, lots of great discussions at those barbecues, but we also did an online survey to try and contact more people outside of the barbecues, and we received feedback online from them. So yeah, we took all their responses, packaged it up, and used that to inform some decision-making.  And what did we hear on the vision? So in terms of the current vision for WIPA, Home of Champions, Building the Future Together. I hate it. Generally, what we found out was that the vast majority of people either liked it or loved it. So 28% of people loved it and 38% of people liked it. Yeah, just a small minority of people hated it at 4%.  So with that in mind, we had a pretty clear idea that we were on the right track with our vision. In terms of the community outcomes, the next layer down. So there's been amendment to the LGA, which has reintroduced well-being and the four well-being domains back into the act, being cultural, environmental, economic, and social well-being. And we've heard what that means for our communities.  we also heard back from our communities on what they would like us to focus on for the next sort of three years. So we got feedback, not just from those barbecues, but also we undertook some targeted stakeholder engagement. So in terms of the community feedback, the focus areas were building vibrant communities, promoting the use of te reo in our communities, attracting domestic and international visitors, and preparing for climate change.  And in terms of the more targeted stakeholder feedback, where we engage with groups directly, we heard from them that promoting connections and health via physical infrastructure was important, that sustainable resource use is important, developing a vision for culture and heritage in the district is important, and that retail and Main Street survival was important.  So that last one there just highlights the fact that that stakeholder engagement happened after the pandemic. So at the forefront of people's minds was the need to how we're going to get through this pandemic and recover economically. So we've taken all that feedback and tested it with our leadership team and our elected members. And where we've landed is not having wholesale changes to our vision or community outcomes,  but just some tweaks to try and clarify a few things. So I'll just run you through where we've got to now.  So now our current vision is Waipa, home of champions, building connected communities. So that kind of picks up on the fact that a lot of what we heard back was about building connections and being collaborative and taking more of a facilitative approach to try and deliver all of the things council needs to do. So we've tried to build that into our vision with the word connected there. In terms of the community outcomes, that next layer down,  We've kind of mirrored the Local Government Act, really, and we've got cultural champions, socially resilient, environmental champions, and economically progressive. And from the feedback we've got on our priority areas for the next three years, we've got creating vibrant communities, leading the recovery of Waip\u0101, nurturing and respecting our unique culture and heritage,  effectively planning and providing for growing communities and preparing for climate change. So, we should see those five areas come through when we prepare our current long-term plan. So, yeah, with that, we've reviewed division community outcomes and strategic priorities. These were formally adopted by council on August 25th, so just recently.  And now we're working with our executive team and elected members to prioritise the business cases that will go into the long-term plan in a way that's going to give effect to the vision, the community outcomes and those priorities. OK. And that will inform our draft LTP and our consultation document.  and we'll look to release that for audit in early 2020 after it formally gets approved by council in December. And then we'll undertake a formal consultation with the community also in early 2020. So, I've probably threw a lot of information at you there. So, I'm happy to open up for any questions and try and answer anything if you've got any questions.",

So all I'm making sure of is that that particular slogan is still vibrant and still  relevant to the people that we are coming in today. And this is for the long-term plan. So going forward, a lot of us who were there in that time is now giving way to a lot more different, a lot more other people, different people, younger people, M\u0101ori, blah, blah, blah. So whatever the slogan we're using for Waipaea needs to be multicultural in itself.  And if, for instance, I came into the town and looked at, oh, you're home of champions, and then I don't know what that means or who the champions were, where do I go to look at all of that? You know, find all of that. Who were those champions? Why are we saying that? So that's the core at all behind what I'm asking. I'm just looking at the wider picture. I don't say, I loved it when it came out, because it was really brilliant.  It did work for the time that the ladies and all of those people were champions. And it was well-deserved at that time. I'm not saying change it. I'm saying how vibrant, how reliant is it today going into the next future with the generation gaps you're having today? And where is that Maori perspective around that? This is a multicultural town. It's getting more multicultural every time you walk outside on the street.  When I first come here, I had to look really hard for other colors of people. So that's all I'm saying, Haven. We're trying to sell WIPA. And that's a good sell for me back from 20, 12 years ago. Going forward, where's the backup for those words?",

You just really wanted to pick up from the item at the last committee meeting.  around the COVID recovery and what we're doing there. So this is, I guess, been through Strategic Planning and Policy Committee now, and I guess the key elements that we are looking at as part of that recovery are the establishment of a $400,000 fund.  for recovery purposes. So social social purposes. Pointing of two community advisors, so that two advisors that will community.  We'll get deeply into the community networks and assist with getting groups to collaborate. Helping organizations just find resources, run fundraise.  And just generally collecting intelligence of what is happening in the community. We fully expect we're not seeing the worst of COVID's effects yet, so it'd be important just to keep that together and also to link with other agencies.  So those two positions are out. Just advertising, I think, has just commenced on those. And yeah, so also investing $120,000 into promotion, district promotion and events promotion as well. And that all comes from, that's not from ratepayer funding, it's from our arbitrage fund.  So just around the allocation of the $400,000 fund, expected to be in two tranches. First will be by application and open to charitable groups and social groups, marae, etc.  And the second round would be by invitation, and when community advisors get on board, they'll sort of be working across those organizations, identifying good projects that we might be able to utilize for the second round of that funding.  The funder will be allocated via a working group and at the moment with the membership we're looking at that is two councillors being Deputy Mayor and Chair of Strategic Planning and Policy.  Iwi Relations Advisor Shane, a manager of a community development fund, a community philanthropic fund, so probably someone from Trust Waikato. Two mana whenua reps and two community sector leaders.  So we've been looking for some feedback from the committee about appointment of those mana whenua groups. Sorry, just getting a bit of interference there. Yeah, so that's pretty in a nutshell. I don't know if you want to add anything to that Debbie.",

Thanks for the invitation. Obviously, my report has gone through, the quarterly report, and there's a lot in it. If I could just sort of touch on  The base of that report, it's at a national, regional and also local level. So we try to include everything in that quarterly report. Probably the two most\u2014or the most topical thing is obviously around COVID-19.  over the last quarter, well, nearly six months now. But there are a couple of other things I want to touch on before we get to that, that were quite significant for our area. So the first one is around the administrative, the renewing of our shared service agreement.  So that came up. That's, I guess, for civil defence emergency management, the shared service arrangement is between Waip\u0101, \u014cturohonga and Waitomo councils. So there's two of us that are employed with that, and we work across all three councils managing civil defence and emergency management.  So the other thing around, so that's the structure that we work across, just so there's some understanding around that. Just moving on to the events. Aside from COVID, probably the biggest event that we've had was earlier in the year was around the drought. And there were two parts to that.  So one of them was around, I guess, our town supply and the water shortages, and especially in Te Amutu. So that was the lack of water in the dam. And I guess we got to\u2014I think it was level four, which was the highest in the region. Luckily, I guess the rains came, and I guess that solved that problem.  But just as much, which people weren't really aware of aside from the town supply, was the tanked water supply to people, you know, which was obviously outside of council and outside of councils.  responsibility, but within civil defence and emergency management, that was significant in that we had vulnerable people out there that were very close to completely running out of water. And I guess the issue was around there was the ability to get water to them, but actually the trucking firms or the water supply people were overrun with demand and there was an inability to  to meet that demand over a very short period of time. So I think, I guess, the way forward around that is some of our messaging to those people on tank water supply around building some resilience, I guess, booking in and considering, you know, that we might have another drought next year or the year after is what does that look like? And then working with those water suppliers as well.  But that was quite a significant event. And actually, even through COVID, that remained up through other parts of the Waikato region, certainly Thames Coromandel area as well. Any questions around that before I sort of touch on COVID?  Okay, so COVID-19, obviously a national state of emergency. So the most, you know, you've just touched on it with recovery. So that was on the 25th of March. Our Western Waikato EOC was established the following day to manage, I guess,  There were kind of three parts to that. So that was, I guess, leading and coordinating the non-health consequences of COVID-19 across our Western Waikato area, supporting DHBs to deliver their health response and, I guess, providing some leadership and reassurance  to communities through making sure that the comms, the communication, the public notifications were getting through to all communities. So it was really a health-led event, certainly supported by civil defence. And obviously, where we came in as one of the arms of the welfare response was administering some of that funding, government funding, through to those vulnerable  people by supporting, I guess, food banks, iwi distribution centres, those sorts of things, and setting processes around that. So some things, I guess, we did quite well. There's been a full, I guess, review on it. There's always things that you can do better, and I guess  the meeting this morning. I mean, some of the review was around, certainly around, I guess, involvement of iwi and within our response there. And there were certain, certainly some learnings that we, you know, that we could learn from.  took from that. I thought our engagement with Iwi was good once we got going, but I certainly acknowledge that where we can, I guess, make some gains and improvements is for us to understand, you know, who the correct representative should be within our EOC, you know, not only in the response, but in readiness and at what level, you know, those people that are Iwi  that we're understanding that are putting through to build those relationships. In addition to that, yes, so falling out of that debrief, there's some good work. I think there's a workshop next week. I'm not sure some of you may be involved with that where I guess we start to look at those things. So those learnings out of how we manage COVID-19.  should we get a resurgence? We've already had one, I guess, and that's our preparation now is our planning around resurgence. Should we get something, you know, similar to the Auckland situation within one of our district council areas? And, you know, we're required to go into a regional lockdown very similar to what we saw in Auckland. So that's kind of where our planning is at and making sure that, I guess, we're working with iwi around that.  The rest of the report is given that they're kind of the things that jump out at me, Your Worship, Mr. Chair. So, I'm happy to take questions. Greg Morgan Thanks, Dave.",

There were some things that we would get asked. We would go, well, actually, we're not in that decision. That's not our decision to make. But again, I think we got better at that. Certainly the public information management was difficult, so we were pushing it out through our social media. But like I noted that as well, going as one of the improvements  is how do we actually get people to understand what we're doing and those important messages that are going out, not just the health messages, but certainly the information around where to go for, you know, to get help for vulnerable people.

The second thing is that one of the terrible things that I found in the Auckland situation was how little notice we got of the second one, and just this heightened confusion.  So communication is definitely one of the difficult things that would probably have to be lifted in terms of liaisoning and working with a whole lot of different groups. I think that's a fair point about who was developed. I mean, in our committee, many of them weren't used to working in the Waip\u0101 area. And so there was a little bit of  in action for a while. And also different groups were better resourced, you know, in terms of the iwi. There were some iwi that were post-treaty and they're in a far better resourcing space than those that are in the pre-treaty space. So there were things in our review that I noted that we probably need to keep working on is  reviewing and also coordinating and facilitating the different positions as they work on. And so that, although we pack it away now, as a school, and I'm talking in the school areas, we had to be able to revive those plans like overnight. And so there were, it's something just to keep in consideration for Te Aumuri. Should a whole lot of people suddenly fly in on a plane  in Hamilton and suddenly dump all the COVID issues on you, which is really what happened to us. And so, I guess what I'm saying is that these committees really have to stay active in terms of reviewing and being prepared for such an event again. Greg Morgan Thanks, Barney.",

    "text": " Yeah, just a tip of, and this is just more for information, and it's actually concerns what you've already heard. And I support what Debbie has just said. We held a New Zealand M\u0101ori Council conference as soon as lockdown was lifted. And one of the strongest voices that came out in it  was exactly about how Maori disconnected communities and outlying communities were disadvantaged. As close as Otahonga, for example,  were complaining about they were totally pushed aside because they weren't the appropriate people to speak with. And that's, I heard Debbie talk about that, saying exactly the same thing. And I'm pleased also to hear that you've received those, or you've realized those errors, and now are going to go forward in a different type of space.  But just for your information, let me make it clear that our people's first call is their local community, which in 99.9% of the time is their marae. If ever you need to get in touch with our people, call their marae and they will give you everyone.  instead of going through a process that was set up without consideration for those communities. Because this is going to happen again, and mistakes will be made again. But I think if you take the right community to be able to get to the people in need, you'll get there earlier rather than later. Because what we heard in the New Zealand M\u0101ori Council Conference was that by the time we got there, you're too late.  they had taken other steps that they could. And in some cases, they had gone right outside of their district, for example, from Tamarindu to Taupo, to get that very response that they weren't getting internally.  So I'll just give that for information so that you're aware of the community that were disadvantaged whilst some of those things have happened. Thank you.",

And that's not a position that we want to get into. But just a comment I'd like to make as well is that it's a two-way street, I suppose. And whilst obviously our civil defence organisation getting in touch with the Maraes is good,  then the marae should equally know how to get in touch with our civil defence organisation. So, and that's something that we potentially could work on. So, rather than us, I suppose, from a civil defence point of view, trying to push out to the marae, at least if they know how to contact us immediately, that would be helpful as well, I would think.

I think it was about 2013 when we last had a good look at those arrangements and quite a lot has changed in the interim.  joint management agreements, a lot of legislative change, treaty settlements, I guess changed expectations, co-management, all sorts of things in that mix now. So it's timely to have a really good look at what our current arrangements are. I think one of the key drivers for this is that really I think everyone is feeling the strain of all that extra.  extra communication and. Deliberation that's going on, you know, right across the spectrum. So you know, I think trust boards, mana whenua and council were all kind of experiencing that, and I think it's just it's about looking for a, you know, are there opportunities to improve the way we're partnering with iwi and mana whenua around  around all sorts of different issues. So just also noted there that, you know, Gaylene may want to chip in on this as well, but Ng\u0101ui T\u014dp\u016b have been, I guess, going through a similar sort of exercise, just started last month or so, looking at what, I guess, you know, almost like a strategic plan. Where is Ng\u0101ui T\u014dp\u016b going to as well? I think probably,  Again, if you want to comment, but what we're doing at the moment doesn't seem to be sustainable in the long term, so we need to be looking at how we can do things.  I guess more in partnership, but also, you know, can we work cleverer? What resource is going to be needed to achieve that? So I guess, you know, looking at funding as part of that equation, what, you know, what do we need to provide there?  So it's quite a big mix of issues and a lot of k\u014drero to go around that. We haven't scoped out exactly what this will mean in terms of hui and the like, but we will be trying to do that over the next month and get more of a picture on when we expect to be able to have those discussions.  So, but really I just wanted to put that on the table now just to flag that it is something that we do need to. We've been told to turn our minds to, so certainly Shane and I and Chuck will be scoping that up in the very near future.",

It's a new experience both for Waip\u0101 District Council  and also for iwi authorities and hapu that we begin to manifest that, I suppose, the treaty relationship at this level. And so it'll take a while, some new heads, some new thinking, and it's probably forging a way through that will look to satisfy both parties.  How will we do that? Well, it needs to be underpinned by communication and by the treaty relationship itself, those principles of partnership, et cetera. That's the way forward in this area. But it's a changing and dynamic field in which we're  roving at the moment. It's going to get exciting. And less of an issue, more of an opportunity. Yeah.",
