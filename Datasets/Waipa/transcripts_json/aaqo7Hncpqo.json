So I have those two apologies. We didn't have any more than that, did we, Jenny? No, just the two. Excellent. And moving on then to disclosures of members' interests. Roger threw his hand up there. So Roger, all those in favour say aye. Aye. Against, carried. Right, moving on to disclosure of members' interests. Do we have any? I don't believe we have any.  Conflicts today, nobody contacted me about that. Excellent. Fantastic. Late items, I'm not aware that there are any late items to be brought up today. So moving on then to the item on our agenda was confirmation of the order of the meeting. Order as I understand it, as it appears in the agenda, I have recommendation there.

Mike and second and Claire, all those in favor, say aye.  aye against carried okay so we'll move on to the confirmation of minutes there on page three as is our usual practice I'll just cite the numbers of the pages of the actual meeting minutes and if somebody has an issue with them they can just alert me to it so that's page four and five six and seven",

    "text": "Thank you, Chair. And good morning, everybody. This item is to change a resolution from December 2019's meeting of this committee.  You may recall that the committee resolved to recommend to council adoption of a new fire control bylaw. However, before we could actually bring this to council in December, we got some further legal advice that said that even though we were actually removing about 80% of the bylaw, it was actually an amended bylaw rather than a new bylaw.  is this sort of fine line between when an amendment becomes so big that it's actually a new bylaw. But it's quite important in this case because under the amendments in the Fire and Emergency New Zealand Act that was amending the Local Government Act in terms of consultation, we don't need to consult on this bylaw change if it is an amended bylaw.  but we do if it is a new bylaw. So in the circumstances at the moment, we probably have bigger issues to consult on than some amended clauses of a bylaw. So what we're asking for today is to revoke December's resolution and replacing it with a new resolution  that the committee recommends council adopt an amended fire control bylaw 2015. You've got in the appendices of the report what the amended bylaw will look like. So lots of clauses are showing as deleted. And in the second appendix, you can actually see what is proposed to be taken out because it's no longer part of council's jurisdiction.  Thank you, Chair. Happy to take questions.",

And they're not deleted from the table of contents, but in actual fact they have been deleted from the body. And I also queried the need for the definition of restricted fire areas. Like I think there's maps at the back that show permanently restricted fire areas for the urban areas or residential areas of the district.  But in actual fact, it only applies for getting permits, and now we don't need to get permits. So I think, I don't know if they need it anymore.",

    "text": " Good morning Madam Chair, morning Councillors, Your Worship. So this is an update report and probably from this point going forward we'd like to probably take this to the committee on a regular basis just because of a weak programme around plan changes which is fairly ambitious I suppose. So by way of update I'm looking at under item or paragraph three  We've got a district plan work program which comprises of five work streams. So we've got a plan changes, work stream, national planning standards, e-plan, national directions and legislative changes. I'll take the report as read but we'll just take you through a summary if that's okay. So we do have a suite of plan changes which we've  I guess, programmed as different types. So we've got seven do now plan changes, three do next, and at least two private. And just as an example of how the work or this particular work stream is quite agile, there's some updates since this report was written that I'll take you through. So under 3.1, we talk about two plan changes had already been started and underway. There's another two I'd like to add to that. So plan change 15, which is around permeable surfaces.  and plan change 16 which is technical improvements so those ones we're now considering as having been started. Plan change 14 so in the report we talked about notification 2020 slash 2021 as a result of a meeting with a landowner on Friday we're now looking at potentially notifying that one October 2021 so I haven't even had the chance to update our workstream program around that yet so this is an example of how we're quite agile around the space.  So I'll just take those other ones there as read. I'm happy to take questions later on any of those specific plan changes. The do next. So we've got some infill subdivision that we will be looking at. That's quite a big plan change on its own. And also that aligns with the National Planning Standard for Urban Development.  Rather than, well there's two issues around that, we don't have a resource at the moment to commence that, but also the risk of going ahead and doing that now would mean that we may end up with a plan change that we need to change later on once the NPS comes out. So we think it's prudent to hold off on that one. We do have a council plan change on a programme around M\u0101ori sites, significance in Papak\u0101inga. So again, quite a body of work around that and that's one that we'll be doing at a later stage.  And the third one is around rezoning, just rationalizing some zoning. The reason that's what I'll do next is because the time frame is a little bit uncertain around those, so we're waiting for other factors to, I guess, advise us and inform us when those might happen. National planning standards. So just a reminder that that's a government requirement where all district plans are reformatted into a consistent standard.  We do have a deadline around that of 2026. We've de-prioritised that at the moment because some of these plan changes we're quite keen to get up and away. So Julie's done a fair bit of work on that already, but that's kind of on hold at the moment. On the 3.3, the ePlan, so again as part of the National Planning Standards, we do have to have an interactive electronic district plan up and running by 2026.  So separately to this report we do have an e-solutions program of work which the council is rolling out, e-plan is part of that. So all going well, we anticipate hopefully that the budget will be confirmed for that through the annual plan and then we can start looking at procurement for an e-plan platform. National directions, there hasn't been a lot of activity with COVID around that nationally, however there's still a couple that we anticipate coming into force  In the next few months, we haven't had any updates from central government around that. So that's around biodiversity, urban development, highly productive soils. And each of those will probably require that we make changes to our plan, mandatory changes without going through a consultative process. And there may be some consequential changes there as well. Just finally, there are three legislative changes that will impact the work programme.  So the first one you may be familiar with is a bill that's progressing under urgency to fast-track some COVID projects around through resource consenting. So there'll be some criteria around there and the process as we understand it's a bill at the moment. The process as we understand it is any applicant with those kind of projects could apply to the Minister.  The Minister makes the determination and if he agrees that the candidates are fast-tracking then they would go through a process that may not even have a hearing. There may be no consultation. So it's quite a streamlined process and the Minister makes a decision around that. Council's involvement in that at the moment is minimal. So if there's an application in a particular area  then the minister can invite someone from the council to be part of that decision-making body and also the minister can invite some feedback from I guess council staff at a technical level but there's no mandate to do that so we'll see where that one ends up. I think Local Government New Zealand has put a submission in asking for a bit more involvement at a local level. There's two other legislative  activities underway so one is the bill to amend the RMA that's coming very close to enactment that reinstates parts that were previously repealed so there's there's no real impact on our business as usual it introduces a new fast track hearing process for freshwater plants which doesn't really affect us directly but it also strengthens enforcement powers so the Environmental Protection Agency will have more powers around enforcement than they haven't had previously  which is a good thing for us because it means if we're in a situation where we need to get some extra support around enforcement, we can shoulder tap the EPA to get some support around that. And the final one is a comprehensive overhaul of the RMA. Some intel from the ministry officials last week was that they're expecting still the technical advisory group to report back July on that, around the recommendations and then a cabinet paper will follow. So that's still on track.  So as you can see, quite an ambitious work program we've got there. Plan changes is our priority at the moment. We're confident we do have the budget and resource to manage that, but we'll need to keep quite a close eye on how that's tracking through the process. And happy to take questions.",

The question I have is not particularly related to those issues, but more that in Auckland, there's been a thing about water tanks or rainwater tanks, and that they are classified as a building, you know, under the unitary plan, and so people need resource consent. So what's the situation in Waipa if people wanted to put a tank in there? There are those sort of hurdles that people face here, aren't there?",

I don't think there's any impediments in our district plan for doing that but there's also no compulsion so we don't require people to do that.",

Luckily, with level four, we were still able to progress and we're working with archaeologists and Heritage New Zealand to get the necessary approvals to do the works. Rob Sinclair, our project manager, is working hard now and there'll be seeding in spring for those works. When we went to Ng\u0101i W\u012bt\u014dp\u016b at the end of last year to talk to them about the works, Harold Maniapoto raised that the creek name for the area  is actually T\u016brata rather than Rata T\u016b. And he pointed us in the direction of a written reference that's on the M\u0101ori Affairs website, which is quoted in the report. And following that, we went to Maniapoto Ki Te R\u0101ki's hui in February. And again, it was confirmed that the correct name, correct traditional name, is T\u016brata for the area. We followed up with DOC to confirm what would be the process we'd have to follow to change the name. And they confirmed  that it wouldn't need to be a formal reserves act process given that that name is a name just to identify a number of land parcels and not specifically a reserve name. And so we went to the Te Awamutu community board last month, they endorsed the name change and today we're seeking your approval to make that change. And so that will be for obviously some reserve signage on site, the council website, any information relating to the area.  and also letting our leases and other stakeholders who refer to the area to update them on the name change. So, happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Tina.",

For them, it was a landmark.  so okay it's not a historic thing there but that was how it stayed in the plan because they're going to remove those old sheds around it and tidy it all up but yeah so we're there you want to revisit that but the community very loudly told us  that they if it didn't if it wasn't causing any harm and it wasn't in anybody's way uh please leave it there fence it off and and so that kids can't go climbing up and when we officially get the park sorted out uh but that's the only reason it that it survived as community demand this might be due for another discussion because the community that i talked to don't actually see it as a significant thing and would much rather have",
