Hopefully we will migrate at some point back to chambers or a blended way of meeting into the future. But for now, this is the best we have. So I hope you're all safe and well.  So let's just kick off with our agenda there. Apologies, I believe we have everybody on deck. Graham indicated to me he may have to sneak off at some point during the meeting, which is fine. Marietta isn't here, but I don't have any apologies for her. So if we could perhaps, I'll happy to move Graham's apology in terms of his absence during the meeting, and Philip, you'll second that. All those in favour say aye.",

So perhaps on the demand side or initiatives  that council or central government can be getting underway to actually deliver some affordable housing. And I do appreciate what Phil said, actually, because it's a message that is filtering through quite strongly now, that the supply chain is in real trouble, and it's just gonna mean, yeah, materials are gonna get scarcer and therefore more expensive. I'm just feeling really impatient that some of us knew all along, actually, that it wasn't the supply that was the problem,  and still nothing's being done.

But  You know, we're going to have to go, as Kevin Honest keeps telling me, you're going to have to go up more than go out, and big sprawl.

I think one of the realities is, and it's not a nice reality, is that we live in an extremely desirable part of the country on extremely expensive land. And it is just a fact.

And unless you're going to change that, I really personally can't  I can't see developers dropping $100,000 or $150,000 or $200,000 on sections, because supply and demand is a basic principle of economics. And though it might be nice to hear, in this area, in Waipa, it is one of the most desirable places, proved by all the stats that we get through Informatrix, for people to want to come and live, work, play, and all the rest of it.  So I hear what people are saying, but I really think we have to be realistic, too, of what we are living in. And we are living in a place that people want to live.

I'm a bit disappointed that we haven't had more happening with the Housing Working Party because that would be the place to progress it really.

One of the work streams of that is to look at affordable housing for Waipa in conjunction with Hamilton City and Waikato District.  So that's underway at the moment. We've got David Mead, he's been working with the Queenstown Lakes District Council and advising nationally on that, doing the work for us. So he's preparing an issues and options document, which we expect to come out October, November, probably more October. That will give us a really good steer for what affordable housing means in the subregion, but also specifically in the Waip\u0101 district around both what's causing it,  What are some of the policy responses and specifically how can we apply inclusion and rezoning? I know that was of interest, so that's a piece of work stream that's underway at the moment. We'll be reporting back on that when that comes through. The other piece of work that you may not be aware of, so we're having direct discussions with developers. We've got a number of applications in at the moment in greenfields.  We've connected one developer with Kainga Ora, so they're talking offline around how they can find additional land in Waipa that the developer has not yet identified with Kainga Ora funding it, so they're working together. We've had four other developers, these are large scale ones coming from Queenstown, who are interested in the affordable housing discussion.  They're open and receptive to including affordable offering and part of the at-scale developments. The price points I'm talking about is around $650 to $700 to $750. When we spoke to the developer from Queenstown, he asked, is that just the land values? That was really interesting. We said, no, that's land and house.  So we took a bit of a double take with that one. So there's quite a lot of discussion happening. A lot of it with the developers is voluntary, so we are persuading them as often and as frequently as we can to come on board. But really, I think, as Philip said, it's back in their court because there's nothing we can mandate at the moment. So there was quite a lot of work, so I just thought I'd introduce that because it might be useful for you.",

But what they've done was absolutely brilliant. You would not have known that the affordable housing was any different, really, except that they never had a garage. There was a saving between one and 150,000 by not having a garage. There was parking on the street. There was very little land on the affordable housing because they were two stories. And I'm wondering whether we need to have a look  at some of those little issues like, you know, permeable, certain amount of permeable surface to cater for these things. But it looked like any other suburb, it didn't detract from the quality of the houses around there. And they had a system down there where I'm pretty sure the houses were in a trust so that the person didn't jump in and buy affordable house at 600 and then sell it for a million in so many years time. So there's some dollar things I think we need to look at to try and get that corrected.  Thanks.",

So we'll look at typology and the developers tell us that the way they can get affordable housing is just reduce the footprint. So your building costs about $3,000 a square metre for single storey, about three and a half thousand for double storey. And so what we're told from developers, experienced developers, is they can, you know, at a hundred square metres, 80 square metres, they can deliver.  an affordable house, provided they get the land supply at a cost that they can make it work for them. So I think there's enough tools already, and it comes down to what we're already, I guess, advising that the constraints we've got in the current district plan, we're looking at those a bit more positively under the National Policy Framework for Urban Development. So we're sending the signals that we're encouraging if people have got right urban design, smaller density. So that's one component.  Retention covenants is another component, so very, very good point, Graham, around under the Special Housing Act that Hamilton City did, I think they had around 10% in one of these special housing areas. The first buyers got the capital gain and they flipped it. Yeah, so what you'll see in the issues and options is a concept overseas that's quite common that's not really mature enough in New Zealand. It's called retention covenants.  Queenstown use that in their housing trust. And so what it means is in perpetuity, you're covenanted that any future purchases are locked in to either a cap kind of capital value or some kind of value retention that they don't just get the benefit and then flick it on. So that's part of what we're looking at as well. Great.",

I've listened to you now taking them, going up, and I agree with that, but to have hardly any lawn around the house. And I've just been saying goodbye to my neighbor on the back fence who shifted into an affordable home, house,  with no, very little, very little grass around it, but they can't stand it. They're nearly being driven mad by the kids, what to do with the kids when the mother's got all the housework to do. I just wonder who are we building these affordable homes for and is it a healthy way to go about it? I just, it's certainly from a young family point of view,  It seems to me that, and those kids spend a heck of a lot of time out playing on the street too. So I just, that's my comment.",

So it's certainly pleasing that the report has identified that we've got sufficient development capacity of the short, medium, long term. So that's great. And that's part of,  I guess an outcome of the way that we've planned here at Waip\u0101 in terms of identification of our growth areas, our 2050 growth areas, bringing forward some of our growth areas that were post-2035 earlier so that developers can actually undertake development earlier. And we've seen that happen in areas like T2, for example, where we've done the plan change and that's  that's created the opportunities to develop retirement village and sections. So, and we're working, as Tony was saying, we're working closely with developers and what their offerings are and their structure plans and their growth and their development requests. So, working closely with the developers and also PC13, where we're taking off the deferred status and bringing them into the residential areas. So, we're creating these mechanisms  to allow for these developers to develop. So that's great that we're getting a sufficient development capacity. Yes, certainly affordability is a real key issue and unsurprisingly identified in the report and across the regions. And as already mentioned, Tony, in particular, I talked about Kainga Ora. We're also working with M-HUD as well, Ministry of Housing, Urban Development, who owns big pieces of land, particularly in Cambridge North, that will provide perhaps an offering there as well.  and trying to create affordability. It's providing a range of tenure so that we do have the offering across our towns and across our district. And that's what part of PC 21 that Tony talks about. So that's that's really important. So I think this this report is really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important. I think it's really important.  is a really great report and allows us to really focus in on some of the key issues, something that Councillor Clare's picked up in relation to monitoring some of those key indicators. So that's just my observations. Thanks, Madam Chair.",

This question of a bylaw arises from the decision in Plan Change 18, basically saying that the provisions for beekeeping are not really appropriate in an effects-based district plan. So as an alternative, you could say that this is Plan B.  The question is, do we have a bylaw or not? We've got three options to either not have a bylaw at all, which really leaves us with no regulatory enforcement backup if these provisions still come out of the district plan. Second option is to develop a beekeeping bylaw. Or the third option, which we  are recommending to you as staff, that if we're going to make one bylaw on bees, why not include all the other animals and poultry keeping in residential areas and take those provisions out of the district plan at a later date? So I'm afraid the question really comes down to, is it a bylaw for bees or not for bees? Okay, thank you, Graham.",

It was just a question really, and it's going back a fair bit, but there used to be a whole lot of New Zealand standard bylaws that we could just pick up and adopt without going through too much expense and actually developing our own or,  pick up on one because they're pretty stock standard nuisances that they create across the country. And as I say, there used to be a whole suite of standard bylaws that councils could adopt without too much expense. So if we're going down the path, and I certainly support the recommendation to go for the third option, because it's surprising even  with the demand for sections, there's still sections in the residential area that are being used for grazing horses, aren't they Hazel? Well, it keeps the grass down. But look, it can cause a problem. So look, if we need a bylaw, don't let's spend too much time reinventing the wheel.",
