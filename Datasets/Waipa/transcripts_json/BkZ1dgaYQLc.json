So without further ado, I suppose we might as well start from the beginning and let's get going. Oh, sorry, actually, just one quick thing to try and get through everything. As I mentioned in an earlier email, we'll go around the board  with any comments, and then we will go back around with our amounts. Sally and Kieran are going to average those out and then record the totals. When we get to the end, we can see how we are with our balance. And then if we need to go back and tweak some of the amounts to get to where we want to go, we'll then do that. So is everybody happy with that process?  Yep, cool. Thank you. Righto, so our first application is from CECOS or the Cambridge Committee of Social Services and they were requesting $400 to purchase food vouchers to hand out to people. So seeing Lou's on my top left, I'll start with Lou. Any comments from you, Lou, in regard to that?",

They actually have a wh\u0101nau support worker, which is the funding that Richard was referring to, that council allocated them funding for under the recovery mechanism. But in my understanding, it could probably be utilised better. It's probably not been used in a manner that maximises benefit for people in the district. And I see from the application, their calls for counselling, when you look at their numbers, actually haven't increased. They've actually decreased since 2019.  It doesn't strike me that there's actually an increased need there, particularly in that COVID need space, which to my mind, with the way that the criteria is structured, should take precedence. Therefore, it doesn't. And for those reasons, I'm not interested in supporting them. Okay, thank you.",

And from what I understand, part funding won't help them right now where they're at.  and it's quite possible that they might get other assistance through council in another manner. They are the only ones providing this type of service, but that's very Cambridge focused. Everything is, the activities are focused around Cambridge. So it's a no from me. Okay, thank you. Phil?",

However, due to my association with the president of the organization, I can say that the guts of what they're doing is that they, and a number of bowling clubs throughout the country, have been, due to the chemicals that they've been putting into the ground, they are not environmentally friendly. So those that can afford it,  Those with assistance from outside there have been ripping up the grounds and putting artificial surfaces down. So that's the guts of what these guys are trying to do. They're a fairly small club, socially based, not overly competitive. So they've only got two greens there out in Kikikiki, which you'll see when you go into the Old Town Hall, below the clock tower. The issue that they've had, and I really feel for them, is that in terms of getting the  Getting the green removed to a place where the council and Environment Waikato will allow them to dispose of the soil and the material, which they take off the top here, is fraught with problems. So in terms of getting resource consent and getting soil tests done, these guys had two soil tests done. One of them was they provided their own soil test to say what was in the ground.  So, it cost them several thousand dollars to do that. Now, the council didn't accept that and asked them to go and get another one, which the council organised, but at cost to the club themselves. So, the spend upwards of $10,000 so far before they've even actually had the diggers on site. And these guys don't come to us for funding.

And that does work with all the users on the site, looks after the bookings and manages the bookings for the site and follow-ups, follows up with individual groups and  themselves and doing minor maintenance around the domain during that period of time. What has been funded through the LTP and a request that came from the user group was looking at developing a community hub on Kiiki domain. So we received funding for a feasibility study which I think is in year two or year three  of the LTP. And there was also a request of additional funding to have more of an administrator on site than on top of the caretaker. So that funding has also been supported to a certain extent, not the full amount that was requested, but that is post the community hub feasibility study that that would be implemented in terms of funding.  So at the moment, the person does, the caretaker is appointed by the care key domain user group and they work around the different clubs and doing maintenance on site for that funding. But obviously it's not funding for a full-time person that we support.",

This is a really significant,  what I always call a man's dream, you know, like it's amazing, but it's really big scale. So, you know, they're proposing putting a cycle way through approaching 26 to 28 odd landowners. They've got a significant wake of funding already, but my sense is that what they're seeking from us isn't gonna really make or break what they're wanting to do when they've got bigger pockets and larger fish to fry elsewhere. I mean, the drama we've had trying to put a cycle way through from bloody  this is like a 30-year plan in the making. It's a big deal, and it has a lot of merit potentially, but it's a big fish to fry. We're not going to change the outcome. And I suspect they might have some of that funding already air-tagged for that position they're seeking. OK.",

So I guess I kind of felt like I couldn't really, and they together sought a whole lot of money. There's a lot of money there.  so that they're all after collectively. So I sort of felt like it might be a little bit of a house of cards, if you like, unless we actually say right now, on principle, if we're going to support some of these groups, let's do the best we can rather than bit support all of them. So I guess that's, I don't know, it's not really the answer you're looking for, but yeah, do you see  Do you understand what I'm trying to say? If there's an idea in principle to support operational funding for local te omutu clubs that are either sporting or musical or what have you, or theatrics, I guess we kind of have to make a decision whether we pick one or two or none or whatever and fully back them and invite the others to apply next time rather than  part fund maybe all four of them and then they can't apply again next time. So this falls into the strategic kind of backing if people see it the same way I do in terms of them being local, looking for operational costs,  And people may not share my views in that respect. So you might be best to actually go around the room and see how other people see it. And maybe my thinking will become clearer. I'm not sure. But at the moment, yeah, that's kind of how I'm sitting.

I also noted that none of those organisations have very much money in the coffers to pay for these things and I do appreciate that we're not to prioritise operational expenses but I also feel that if we don't support these little guys and everyone's saying that the big funders are tightening up  that I think that we really need to look after them at this time and at least make some sort of contribution. And I'd hate to see any of them, you know, so just using the little theatre, for example, that if they don't get any funding, that they don't put on a show this year. You know, and that is the reality of it. And these things do help people  get back to normality and have just, you know, things to go and see and do without having to go to Hamilton or go to Cambridge for their activities.

I'm 100% trying to enable  them to continue being active and sporting and what have you, I'm absolutely 100% behind that. I find that's a really expensive amount. And I do wonder if maybe there's some benefit in having perhaps Gina, Gina Scott from Council, who's doing a bit of work around, particularly in the sporting community space. She has obvious strengths in that area. Maybe if she was able to help them in some way  form, you know, because it's a ridiculous amount of money. It's a ridiculous amount of money. And obviously it's not negotiable in terms of you can't pay croquet without it. But there's got to be another answer than them paying four grand every year for that service. And I appreciate that they're an ageing membership and it's getting beyond their  their abilities, and I totally respect that, and we'll do what we can to keep them all out there playing, but I just think there's got to be a better way to get this funded, that's all work through.

And I know I've sat there untouched for a long time, so I suspect that that's the money that's now been transferred from that account to this Rose Society. And I'm just a bit confused by their application in terms of their financial position, because they do suggest it sounds as though they're supposed to repay that, but why would you be repaying it to the pre-existing entity? It just doesn't make any sense to me. And I was hoping somebody would have been able to make that clearer for me, and I'm kind of none the wiser.",

However, looking at the application, although we've got a request for $9,000, I see they say, and bracketed together on their actual application, Te Umuru, Cambridge and Parongia, large amounts, but then they say, these are the amounts that relate specifically to each of the wards. However, we're asking for a total contribution of 5,000. So on that pro rata basis,  I worked out that they really, that meant that they were looking for 4,418 from us. And I guess I was kind of surprised that there were so many more people in the Te Umuru side than there were anywhere else, for starters. That blew my mind. The population is nearly half. Yeah, it just kind of felt weird, okay? That just did not feel right. And the other question I had was, well, who's paid for these up until now? And I guess I'm a real,  I'm a bit cold hearted, and that I kind of feel like they probably have to look at adopting a user pay system on account of meals. Because obviously I'm picking that falling at a shortfall, and they might have to ask people to start making contributions towards those meals. And I accept it's the last thing you want to do when you're going through worry about being fed, but it's part and parcel of being accommodated, is it not? Yeah.  And you would wonder...

So I'm wondering whether that probably, there's a bigger issue here and whether Gina or Corinne could go along and help them and talk more about, there might be bigger issues in play about the sustainability of them being in that property long-term, because that's a lot of money to come up with each week.

So it kind of came down to whether the community board wanted to be aligned with the rodeo. But with that said, they do say that what they're going to spend the money on will benefit other equestrian related sports.

I guess I looked at their application and they made it pretty clear that they've had a 50% increase of texts over lockdown. And I guess bearing that in mind with our criteria, which is COVID recovery and resilience, tick that box. Local, probably not, but then I've made some inquiries with people who work and quite involved in the space, and there's nothing to suggest that their data  that they have provided us doesn't actually bear out to be true in our side of the district. There's nothing about Te Umuru and Kehi-Kehi that suggests we'll be any sunnier than this. So I guess I'm comfortable with assisting these people, because I think there's nobody out there doing what they do. And yeah, I'm very happy with supporting them. Cool, Gary.",

And if we didn't offer them now, I might give them a chance to come back in April with a bit more data behind what they do and stuff.
