Does anybody else have any conflicts? No?  Great, we'll move on to item four of the agenda, late items. There being none, as far as I'm aware, we'll move on to item five, which is the confirmation of the order of meeting. Obviously just the one report, namely the annual plan hearings report. Can I have somebody move that that is the order? Andrew and Roger can second that. All in favour say aye. Aye. Against? Carried.  Fantastic. So moving on to the only item for today, which is, as I said, the annual plans hearings report, and we have Graham Pollard here to present that for us, kick us off. So I'll pass over to you, Graham.

    "text": "As the Chair has said, we now come to the hearing of submissions on the draft annual plan, 2020 to 2021.  For the sake of everyone who isn't quite as familiar with this as council staff and councillors may be, consultation opened on Monday the 23rd of March, which was three days before New Zealand went into COVID-19 Alert Level 4 and lockdown. Consultation continued and closed on Friday the 24th of April.  In total, we received 42 submissions. And in comparison, last year, in normal consultation circumstances, we had 43 submissions, one of which was later withdrawn. So I think we've done really quite well this time round, considering the circumstances.  The early submissions that we received tended to reflect concerns about the effects of COVID-19. Submitters tended to be concerned about levels of rates increases, payment plans for rates, rebates, that sort of thing. And aware of this and conscious of the effects on the community and the economy, staff were quickly looking at alternative options for budgets.  Some letters were received that were directed at all local authorities. The concerns they raised were all valid as submissions on the annual plans generally. These were generally concerned with budgets, rates increases, effects on businesses, especially those that could not trade during lockdown. And then after this initial phase of submissions, we had a pause.  then towards the end of the consultation period we received what you might say are the more traditional types of submissions. Things on council services, fees and charges, general comments and community funding requests. We've also had some that we're looking ahead of what WIPA might look like in the future.  And in total, 14 submitters asked to be heard. Two have since had to withdraw in terms of their presentation, but their submissions remain as relevant as before. So this afternoon, we will hear nine presentations. Tomorrow morning, we will hear three more. And those are submitters who could not attend today.  Now I've tried to group the presenters according to the likely subject of the presentations. So for instance, all the community funding requests are on the agenda for tomorrow. So for the benefit of anyone who is new to this, whether councillors or submitters, the task ahead of you councillors is to hear these presentations with an open mind,  And tomorrow, deliberate on those you've heard and all the submissions that you've read. I believe there is some additional presentation material that's been sent through to us and sent on to you as well. The presenters have been advised to aim for a maximum presentation length of five to six minutes. So this will allow time for your questions afterwards.  and obviously any extension of time to complete questions is at the discretion of the chair. All presenters obviously are appearing via Zoom. Hopefully everyone's in place when their time comes. I also ask you to be aware that some presenters may have other submitters with them watching in the same room.  Or there may be colleagues, a word for the submitters that anyone else in the room shouldn't be joining in the presentation. And of course, there may be others watching via the live stream. Some submitters may wish to stay in the meeting afterwards, in which case I have suggested that  They turn off the cameras and microphones, but that is not essential. So, there we go. Over to you, Chair, and hopefully we have a presenter in place, which should, by my agenda, be Jenny Williams. Chair, thank you.",

No, Jenny hasn't joined the meeting yet, sorry. Okay. We haven't heard anything further, unfortunately. Okay.  So we're nine past one right now. He's on the screen. We have Jenny Dacombs here.

    "text": "Just so my board members obviously won't know the change in time and I think Jocelyn Cooney was going to step on board and Tony G just in case there were any extra questions but I'm sure if there is anything I can answer it anyhow. Right so I presume everybody's received my  verbal, my written information, and I'm not going to go through that all over again. First of all, I'd like to say thank you to the council. I only started this role in February, but I do understand that we've been receiving money since 2015, if I'm not mistaken. So thank you for your support in the past. And I do understand that you're under a strict budget. So I'm sure you've got people asking you for money from all angles.  My main request is during COVID-19 I was seconded by civil defense and my sort of hours went from 25 to 50 or 60 hours a week.  It was very beneficial and as you've seen from my submission we managed to organize an amazing amount of volunteers from our area so hands on and hands and ears on the ground was fantastic and a very beneficial relationship lots of learning curves all around but  I think something that will last for many years to come and will only strengthen. Because of this, we have a very limited budget already, and with me only starting in February, I have volunteered a lot of my time for that process. Just can't sustain my salary for those extra hours, but maybe some consideration moving forward, because I sort of don't know where to get  any extra help in that regard. And I'm also officially the fundraiser, so funding as you're aware is a little bit depleted all over the place at the moment. So as it stands at the moment, I probably have a salary until November.  But I'm saying that I have Te Waka on board, I'm meeting with them, they're coming to help me and these endless people who've put up their hands to come and do a business strategy plan with me so I'm very confident that we'll be fine and I'm going to give it my best to get there but  Just moving forward, any additional funding would be most appreciated. As you'll all know from the newspaper, our numbers have just grown and grown. Sorry, I'm not shaky, it's just my something's coming across a bit weird. I don't know what it's sounding like to you.  Our numbers have grown during COVID-19, actually in a very beneficial way for us. We actually engaged with so many of the elderly who normally would be isolated and they've come onto the radar, onto the network. So moving forward, I think we gained about 460 members in a month.  which I still have to actually engage with quite a few of them obviously during COVID-19 I couldn't physically go and see people but a lot of them have registered and are now going to set up new groups in the neighborhood which is fantastic. The one thing I really would appreciate some help if possible is as I mentioned we have to put these new signs up  So they're really lovely, they're supported by the police. And this is our new logo, which has come out. So you might be aware of the previous ones with the yellow and blue, they're quite faded all over the place. I managed to put up about six of these before lockdown and the support to the new ones been absolutely fantastic. It's quite upbeat and funky and nationwide, these 67 areas that are now putting them up,  and it's being recognised as quite a significant support for neighbours, that we would be really happy if Waipou wanted to stick their logo down there. So as a sort of business partner moving forward, absolutely happy head office would be really supportive of that from Wellington as well, and would actually encourage all the other neighbourhood supports to work with their council in the same way.  I'm working very closely with the police at the moment, and Deb Thurgood has just put out a brochure, which unfortunately I couldn't get to you on time, but I can submit it later on. In this, her and I are really trying to clamp down on drug areas in Cambridge, and we're putting out beneficial flyers to members of the public about what comes from who,  But it's sort of what to look out for, who to contact, not to engage with anybody that you suspect may be cooking or anything like that. Out of the woodwork during COVID-19 came a lot of this. A lot of people came to light who might have just submerged into the public during normal times.  It's actually been quite a good thing as well that we are aware of a lot more people in the neighbourhood than we thought initially who were dealing. So Deb and I work very proactively now. I also only have 20 hours, 25 hours a week to spread myself quite far and wide with her, but I feel it's really beneficial for us at the moment to just try and  make those people aware that we are aware of them in the neighbourhoods and they're not just going to be left to carry on unnoticed so it's quite significant. Obviously working with our community patrollers as well who work very closely with the police.  and myself. They've also actually just been asked to stand down at the moment until I think we move to a safer level for them. Many of them are in their 70s. So also with them, a number of new people have come forward during COVID-19 wanting to assist them. So all in all, just making a far more safer, resilient Cambridge for everybody.  and one of my main projects moving forward this year is with the high school so the head boy and head girl and the executive committee have come forward to me and we identified a major need in  Most of the volunteers, unfortunately, were lions and those sort of places were over 70 and had to go into lockdown. So we had to source younger volunteers and a lot of them have come through, wonderful youth have come through, very keen to  buddy up with the elderly still during winter to do gardening, to just be supportive for them. A lot of the elderly are trying to do the online shopping, which has become a bit of a nightmare for them. So the youngsters within legal parameters will be assisting them with  working out how to do online grocery shopping, going over and over and over, if necessary, with a lot of patience and kindness so that they can feel more self-sufficient and just be better off in winter generally. So I don't know if I've taken up enough of your time. That covers the basics.",

    "text": " Yeah, good afternoon. My name's Pete McLaughlin. I'm Managing Director of Coxwell Surveys, a multi-discipline firm covering surveying, planning, and engineering. Our firm's been based in Cambridge for over 50 years. Most of our work is carried out in the Waip\u0101 district with a focus on Cambridge and the rural surrounds. We have clients ranging from mums and dads, rearranging titles on their family farms, to young couples undertaking their first subdivision of their own property in town.  We also deal with large developers responsible for Cambridge's premier subdivisions, such as Pukekura, St Kilda, and Norfolk Downs. The focus of our business is on quality outcomes, getting it done and getting it done right. We're not about taking the easiest option or shortcutting. We're big on transparency and understanding the detail. Once we understand it, it brings clarity, appreciation, which we can then pass on to our clients.  Key component of my submission was obtaining clarity around how the fees and charges have been calculated, directly in relation to consenting activities. In our submission, we challenged council to give us information on how the fees and charges were calculated. What were the costs of the labour, materials, overheads, capital, and how they go into making up the hourly rates. If you've read the council comments on  the submission, you'll see that they have not been answered. With generalised statements such as staff rates follow local government best practice, and they're in line with other councils charge rates. We did a bit of an analysis on the 2019-2020 year because that was the one we had the easiest comparison on because not everyone's at the same stage that Waip\u0101 is. In Waip\u0101 District Council was certainly  if not the most expensive, pretty much the second most expensive of the local councils. And we'd like to understand why a planner in Waip\u0101 is $182 an hour, and in Waikato they're $150 an hour, and in Thames they're $165 an hour, and in Hamilton City they're $175 an hour. So why is Waip\u0101 more expensive and why are we increasing again?  A similar story plays out in development engineering. Again, Waip\u0101 are more expensive and increasing. Again, I believe that Waip\u0101 engineers and planners have the same skill and qualifications as other councils, so why the different rates? This is why we were interested to know how the hourly rates are calculated, so we can understand why they are higher.  So if you want further facts and figures, refer to the submission. So late last year, we actually met with senior council planning staff to confirm whether there was anything that we could do to improve our applications and therefore processing time, because we'd been concerned with the amount of hours that was being charged and then invoiced to our clients. We were told at that time that our applications were of a high standard, and that is reinforced by the low number of further information  When COGS will receive any invoice from Council as the agent, we are obliged to look through it and determine whether it's appropriate, and then pass it on to our clients. We need to look at the detail, understand the detail, because ultimately those questions come back to us. We're not unreasonable.  But we do know what it takes to get the job done so that we're more than happy to raise questions when we feel charges are not in line with the complexity of the application. In conclusion, our main concerns lies with the lack of transparencies in WIPA's hourly rates in regards to processing of resource consent in comparison with other councils. And as I said, today, we've been unable to understand how these are calculated. The words provided in the staff comments and the submissions have not  increased our understanding. We're also unclear on how these rates are higher than most private practice professional firms are justified when there's no profit component in the council charging. Whilst the submission is focused on hourly rates, I'm more interested in what can be done in an hour. So if there's any ways that we can increase productivity, we're always happy to take on feedback. Thank you.",

    "text": "So, a couple of things have been raised.  The fees and charges have an underlying funding policy, which I guess is the breakdown of overheads versus direct costs. So in the review this year, we weren't asked to undertake a review of our funding policy that underlies the fees and charges. The review, like just about every annual review, looked at the current fees and charges and made an informed assessment on whether under the RMA they are still actual and reasonable.  and that's what we're allowed to recover under the RMA. So I guess the first point is it wasn't a comprehensive review of the funding policy that underlies the fees and charges. What I mean by that is what are the overheads? What are the direct costs? So that's probably the first point. So that's why the information that we couldn't provide wasn't needed in our view because it wasn't a review of the funding policy that underlies the fees and charges.  So if you take that as a first principle, we then went through all the fees and charges quite comprehensively. We ran a test through whether we thought they were actionable and reasonable, and we were aware of some challenges around fees and charges that have come through from different consultants and different developers through the year. So we took those into account. We did benchmark against councils, a number of like-for-like councils. I can't remember, sorry, Pete, which ones we actually looked at.  But we did do a benchmark against other councils and we came to the conclusion that we were pretty much on par. And in fact there was, in our view, justification for a slight review upwards. So I'd be interested to just know around that benchmark and I can figure it out probably offline if you want me to follow up on who we benchmarked against.  You made the comment that the fees and charges are higher than most private sector. That's not our assessment. Our assessment is that they meet the requirements of the Resource Management Act and also the Department of Internal Affairs, where the expectation is that public sector rates are discounted when benchmarked against private sector rates. So that's the underlying financial policy, again, that we didn't review.  but my understanding is our fees and charges do incorporate a discount factor when compared with the private sector. And of course, it's a, I guess, an exercise of averaging. So it really depends on which consultants and which regions and which areas you look at in terms of the benchmarking. So again, we haven't gone down that exercise because we weren't looking at the underlying principles around it.  We're working for efficiencies as well, and so Pete's right that we did have a meeting to look at how we can improve processes at our end as well. And what we've adopted is, I suppose, a continuous improvement process. We did have, the last six months or last eight months, we've had some staffing changes. So we've rebuilt the department and rebuilt the consent team. So we've had new staff come on board with new thinking.  And we are very keen to look at efficiencies and effectiveness around the system and processes and optimising those as well. It's as needed we do, so it's not a comprehensive overhaul of the system and processes because we don't believe they're fundamentally broken, but we are taking the opportunity to improve those so we can see efficiencies in that. And I acknowledge that they are generic comments, but again, just coming back to  it was a review of the existing fees and charges rather than a comprehensive review of the underlying financial policies underpinning.",

And I think also when you're talking about benchmarking of rates, I think it's probably a fair place to start is look at the consultants that you're employing and seeing where their rates are.  that should be a good indication for where you should start, and that's what we provided in the submission. But hey, I'm more than happy to take it on offline and chat about it. It's not the end of the world, and we're happy to engage and discuss more about it. The main concern we have, and it's not on our bigger developers, like this doesn't affect our bigger developers, it's on our two lot subdivisions, three lotters, it's at boundary relocations where costs can get away very, very quickly  people aren't keeping an eye on process. So someone wants to just do a minor boundary change and they use up all the subdivision consent deposit fee, and then they get another invoice, to me, is not really acceptable when we are trying to submit quality applications. We've got to try and look at process to do things better when the risks are low, but also satisfying all the things that Tony has to do on the background.  Happy now.",

So we are entitled to charge for every single hour of every single staff member, but often we do a judgment against that. And so I can say hand on heart that the fees that we are charging out aren't for recovery because we do apply  a reasonable test when the invoices go out. So I just wanted to make that point as well.",

When we apply for a water connection in an urban environment, I haven't got the numbers in front of me, the cost is quite a lot lower than what it is if you go in the rural environment. So it jumps from $400 to $700 just for the application processing fee. And what the response come back  was fine and it pretty much said that everything's on the Pukiremu scheme and no one really knows what's happening there, so that's why it takes the time, and I understand that.",

    "text": "Certainly can. Lovely.  The community board, the Cambridge community board, thanks the council for the opportunity to submit. And we are, I think, fairly happy with most of the responses we've had from the council regarding recommendations, except perhaps the library fees issue, which is a continuing one. And we are just wondering that maybe  getting rid of the library fees could be a good way of immediately reacting to economic conditions post COVID-19 to our community. So we'd just like to say that the policy of charging for all adult books gets many comments from both newcomers to the town and current residents, and it's a deterrent to many who would use our libraries.  Most libraries do have a rental collection, which is something that the Waipa libraries used to have. And in actual fact, I gather that now, just with the fees that are charged on adult books, we're making less money from the fee that goes across all adult borrowing than we did when we had a rental collection. So I think that maybe it is time to rethink this.  But mainly because also the adult borrowing has decreased. Children's and young adult borrowing has continued to increase and their books are free. But even then there is a problem because young adults, the ones, the high school students are only allowed to borrow two adult books. And a lot of them are using the library books to supplement the books they need for their subjects at school. And for some of them, you know,  got seven subjects and they can only borrow two books it becomes a bit of an issue. Well it's not so much that they can only borrow two books but they have to for free out of the adult collection. It's then they've got several subjects they want to get say five books out of the library they're having to pay that 50 cents for each book and for a teenager that can be a bit of a problem. So  Yeah and for some adults it is a problem. I have been told that we do have people who arrive at the library who literally cannot afford to pay the 50 cents even those with the community services card which gets a discount. They're actually weighing up two books 50 cents each or a dollar for a loaf of bread. This is distressing for the staff and as well as for the clients so I think we need to  it's the time that we should be thinking about some of our residents who, in these times where things are going to be a little more straightened, we should be able to do better than that. And if you, yeah, so I just think if we could relook at the speed charging, we're the only library that does. If we have a rental collection that covers those most recent  latest books that everybody wants, just as most libraries in this country do, we'd probably be better off. It would mean we've still got a large supply of books that could be borrowed for free, and I think we might find adult borrowing might go up. And it certainly did go up, particularly the e-books, which people can put onto their phones and all sorts of things over the COVID-19 lockdown. There was something else. Sorry.  So in the future, you know, books are going to be a luxury for a lot of people. So I think we really need to look at the importance of books for our communities. In 1949, UNESCO published a public library manifesto to establish the importance of libraries on the United Nations agenda. And I think it's a pretty important manifesto and one we should all be thinking about.  The library is a prerequisite to let citizens make use of their right to information and freedom of speech. Free access to information is necessary in a democratic society for open debate and creation of public opinion. And I think that's something that we perhaps should take note of. So that's our bit on why we would like to see the fees for adult books dropped. We're quite happy to have a special rental collection  as other libraries do, but this blanket 50 cents for all adult borrowing we think is unfair. And the fact that adult borrowing has dropped considerably since that fee was brought in. So I don't think we have anything else to say on that. If anyone has any questions, I'm happy to answer.",

So are you suggesting, I suppose we've got three choices, we reduce the level of service in the library,  we increase the rates to pay for it or we and your third option I suppose today was looking at a rental section of the library to try and generate that revenue so which is your preference?

I'm very lucky to live and work on our family farm, which is situated at the top of Mangakawa Hill. And as you will have read my submission, that relates to the issues that we have been having over several decades now in the Mangakawa Scenic Reserve.  Thank you very much for taking the time to read my submission and for listening to me today. I very much appreciate it. As you will have read, the Senate Reserve holds a very special place in the hearts of our family. Many of my friends and other family members have visited the Reserve on several occasions over the years, and I know that it is a very special place for many people in Cambridge. The three key points that I would like to reiterate relating to my submission, and I know it was lengthy,  around protection. Firstly, protection of the space itself, protecting others that wish to use the space and ensuring that it is safe for them to do so. Secondly, protection of a heritage space. Some of the buildings that are left in the Scenic Reserve are now 130 years old and they are constantly being damaged and desecrated. Thirdly, protection of the people that live there.  I will just share with you a personal comment, which is one of my earliest memories was waking up to the sound of loud hammering on the door and loud voices outside my family home when I was four. It turned out to be a group of drunk men who had crashed their car off the side of the grass in the reserve and who were asking my father to come up and pull out their car with his tractor. This is at three in the morning in a dark, cold, rainy winter night.  My father acquiesced because he felt that he was going to be subject to more trouble if he didn't meet the request and it would be fair to say that this was a very common occurrence throughout my childhood in the 70s and 80s and later in the 90s when I was much older. My father going up, starting a tractor and pulling out people that he felt would further vandalize our property if he didn't give in to their requests.  I've listed several pages of what we've encountered over only the last 18 months as people that live just below the reserve and it's fair to say that I'm very saddened to see this area so neglected and so unloved and I think it's time to review the access policy for it.  I'm not sure how many of you regularly visit the reserve, but I just went up there again this morning for a walk with my children before school and found that overnight, there had been people driving up beside the large concrete reservoirs, damaging the grass, damaging the ground, more graffiti on the buildings, more broken glass in front of our gates, and rubbish strewn everywhere. This is an everyday occurrence for us.  As Jenny from Neighbourhood Supporters stated, more and more people are troubled with drug use in our community. And in short, we feel that the space that we have to work within and live beside is a space where illicit behaviour will be ignored and condoned. I'd really like you to consider allocating some funds to closing the reserve during the hours of nightfall, which is when it appears to us that 90% of these problems and the difficulties that we're encountering take place.  Thank you for your time.",

I totally understand what you're saying. I take my family up there too. And over lockdown, it actually was shut down for a period of time. I think it was a car up there or something. I don't know if that's why it was shut down, but it was nice and quiet. And a gate like Waipuki, just an absolute no-brainer to keep the riffraff out of there  inappropriate times. It's also a risk when they do go up there early in the morning or evening, there's still some people cycling and walking. And these tend to be the people that just don't give a toss about anyone.

    "text": " Thank you, Susan. T\u0113n\u0101 koutou e t\u0113nei ahi ahi. I am Ange Holt, Chair of the T\u016bpuna Community Board and would like to speak to a couple of points on our submission. Firstly, I would like to reaffirm our support for council in regard to the changes needed in the annual plan due to the impact of COVID-19. Certainly don't envy your position on that one. In addition, I would like on behalf of the board to thank all the staff  for the awesome job they did helping to keep Waip\u0101 safe and informed alongside the Western District Civil Defence during lockdown. An important part of our submission is the George Street car park. Te Amuru Community Board has been working at getting improvements made to this area of town for at least three terms and we're pleased to have received in November 2019 a plan for some of the suggested improvements to be made  including a raised pedestrian walkway to the toilet to help slow the traffic and make it safe for those crossing on that little corner. This I understand needs further financial support from council and we would like to recommend its inclusion. How someone has not been seriously hurt just there is really good luck rather than good management as lots of cars do go around there at some speed.  Also like to see further funding allocated by the annual plan or into the LTP to sort this area out once and for all. There needs to be a footpath from McDonald's down to the warehouse and Tony and Angela Rowland are very open to assisting. We need angle parking and some directional arrows to get the traffic flowing in a logical manner. There are constantly near misses down there and all the shop owners will support this.  Last year, we did a small survey on Facebook and had considerable discussion with the community who are also keen to see this happen. As our population grows, the congestion and confusion in the space is only going to get worse if we don't do something about it. And I see there is 4.1 million in the LTP under project T9 for town centre parking. So can some of this being tagged for George Street, Carpark Precinct? Footpaths.  In addition to a submission, we'd love to see an improved way of being able to give the community some sort of timeline in regard to when a footpath is going to be repaired. As a community board member, it's really frustrating when we're told it's going to be done, and 18 months later down the track, that piece of footpath is still not repaired, and we have members of the community coming back to us saying, I thought you said it was going to be done. I understand it is a little tricky, but with today's management software,  I find it hard to believe that a solution isn't relatively simple to find. On the car parking front, I think that's a hot topic across both towns, Cambridge and Te Awamutu, and it is something that's continually raised with us by the community. The options we've included in our submission from us are based on feedback, and we're delighted to see that there will be marked spaces and time limits in the CBD areas.  I've seen a recent press article that stated that studies have shown there are enough parks, which is great. However, it doesn't actually address the perception and the reality that people cannot get a park due to them being frequently taken for longer periods of time by people who work in the CBD. We are a service town with a rural community who scoot in, do a job or two and scoot out. And we need some parking spaces to reflect this. We believe that if there were some 10 to 15  whoops, 10 to 15 minute park scattered along the street and at least some monitoring, then this would be a help. We also strongly recommend the use of the space in Churchill Street to provide some temporary parking for people working in the CBD. Visiting the event center and the hub, we believe this is an ideal midterm solution. And as long as it's promoted as such, the community is capable of recognizing this is not a permanent solution. Usually it is just a mess with piles of metal,  wood chip or even slabs of concrete piled down there. The town entrances, this is something that's been on the cards for many years and something community board has been advocating for at least three or possibly four terms. And it's time it got bumped up the ladder. And our community board would like to continue to be involved by working with the community to help bring their recommendations to the table. Community  sorry, the Te Muru Community Board are keen to work with council for the benefit of our community and help reduce some of your workload where we can be of assistance. I have a board made up of people who are really passionate about our community and want to get stuck in and just do stuff. We're really keen amongst other projects to support the environment through recycling initiatives, and we'll be putting forward a request in due course for permission to pursue these.  Over the past 12 months, we've seen some great improvements in communication from council, keeping us better informed and able to work more effectively. We have a wonderful governance team who do their best to keep us on task. And I would like to finish by thanking them for the excellent service that they provide. Thank you. Thank you, Ange.",

In my time it's come up a few times and Richard Hurrell in particular, it's been his baby and to the best of my knowledge there's provision for it in the long-term plan but things have been waylaid I suppose with waiting to see where we're going with the Te Arawai project. But our feeling, well more mine probably,  is that we are far enough down the path of wanting to go down this historical and cultural avenue as an identity for Te Awamutu, so can we start to proceed with this town entrances on the proviso that there's money there to be able to do it? Because it certainly creates a nice feeling for people coming into the town. If the Te Arawai project, fingers crossed, all goes ahead,  It certainly would be nice to have nice entrances, and it'd be welcoming for tourists, both domestic and international that are coming to our town, and to help create a sense of pride for the community as well. So I probably went around the circle bit there, Bruce, but basically it just keeps getting put off for various little reasons that enable it to get shunted back.",

    "text": "OK, so personally, I support all the items that the Te Aumutu Community Board have in their submission. I would like to use my time, though, to draw your attention to the problem we have with domestic violence and why it is so important that Council  do not delay any longer than absolutely necessary with their white ribbon accreditation. I will speak to the affordable housing item with Sue Goodridge from Kainga Aroha next as well. So fortunately, Waip\u0101 has not seen a significant rise in reported cases of family harm during level three and four of COVID-19. This does not mean we do not have a problem here. We were just lucky it did not spike.  In my role as wh\u0101nau resilience kaimahi, I've been asked, along with approximately 114 full-time equivalents around the country, to co-design programs and services with community and wh\u0101nau to create strong, resilient communities where wh\u0101nau live violence-free and to eliminate violence from the next generation. So why do you think government has decided to spend $15.4 million on preventing domestic violence and wh\u0101nau resilience?  because we still have these statistics. Police are called to a DV on average every four minutes. One in three women are sexually, physically, or emotionally harmed. One in four of these women are in the middle to high income socioeconomic bracket. They could be your friends or family. One in eight men are sexually or physically harmed. On average, 13 women, 10 men,  and nine children are killed every year. And that is a drop in the bucket as 80% of domestic violence goes unreported. If you prefer to think in terms of the economic cost like Donald Trump, then how does 4.1 to 7 billion per year sound? I'm not asking for your support. I'm making a plea for your support as this problem needs everyone on board.  community, businesses, councils, and councillors. We need to be open, transparent, and supportive, so those affected, both victims and perpetrators, feel safe and confident to seek the help they require. We need to change the attitude and behaviours of our communities, and one of the ways to do this is by having council and other profile organisations lead the way. Having white ribbon accreditation shows our community and other businesses  that our council take this issue seriously and is looking after their, sorry, I should say, are looking after their staff in the best manner possible. This in turn will encourage other businesses to step up and get accredited, or at the very least, make sure all their policies and contracts are in line with current legislation. Waipa businesses will be able to show compassion and understanding for their staff that are impacted by domestic violence. I acknowledge the willingness from staff to undertake  white ribbon accreditation and understand COVID turned up at about the time that they had planned to do the white ribbon training, so a delay is expected. I do, however, implore you not to drop the ball and keep putting it off. This is important and must be prioritised. Our LTP under Goal 4, Division and Outcomes for Social Responsibility, says WIPAR offers an excellent quality of life. It's not excellent if you live in constant fear.  Thank you.",

I would firstly like to congratulate Waipa District Council for maintaining their 130 pensioner housing units. And I suppose my question's more rounded now is to how can we do something to support low income families? And can council lobby for some of the social housing promised in this month's budget? I realise affordable housing is a big issue nationwide. And as we're entering a recession,  these issues are going to be even more difficult. We've got some challenging times ahead. I did look at some research and from the tenancy services website, I see that the current market rent for a three bedroom home in Tiamutu goes from 410 to 460 a week. And in Cambridge, the market rent is 460 to 530. And yes, I'm lucky to own my own home, but our family would struggle to pay 410 a week  And I'm not sure if in our circumstances, the bank would actually lend us money. I do see in 2019, Kainga Ora had 217 state houses in Waipa, and I'm not sure if this has increased or not. And from the Ministry of Social Development website, I saw that in March 20, the current weight for a state house nationally is over 16,000 people. With priority A is defined as at risk,  and that's over 14,000 people, or B, a serious housing need of almost 2,000. And from this wait list, in the wiper area, we've got 76 families looking for houses. 66 are priority A, which is the at-risk group, and 10 are in the serious need category. And even to get on this list, you have to stipulate three areas. So you can't guarantee to stay in the wiper area  So a big upheaval if you've got children settled in local schools and you've got to rebuild your own support networks. And I do see that the government or Kainga Ora are committed to 75% of the 8,000 houses that they're looking at and 25% other social providers. I'm just unsure who these other 25% are.  So many of our clients at Kainga Aroha are marginalised, low educational attainment, poor health, mental illness, low socioeconomic status. So to sum up, they're the first to be fired and the last to be hired. So can the council lobby for some of the 6,000 homes promised in this month's budget? Thank you.",

So that's fantastic to see. We would like to see this bumped up the priority list in terms of preparedness, I can't say the word, is that a word? For creating affordable housing,  that we work together to find innovative ways to solve this problem by knowing what resources are available for us to use, whether they be from central government, community-minded business opportunities, or creative ways to help our people buy their own home. We need to be ahead of the competition, so we are prioritised to accept, sorry, access opportunities as they arise. So for example, the 60,000 homes that Sue spoke of from Kainga Ora,  Then council needs to work with organisations in the community that can access the data we need to make informed decisions and be on the pulse to get the latest updates from government around this issue. It needs to be a co-design process with the community. The social responsibility goal in the LTP states utilising the knowledge and resources within Waip\u0101 for the benefit of the whole community. So let's see that in action and have Waip\u0101 Council show leadership and innovation  around creating affordable housing in Waipa. That's us.",

So, yeah, I want to be very clear. We're not asking for council to come up with money or expecting rate payers to start forking out lots of money to pay for it. I mean, that would be wonderful, but that's not the reality. But what we would like to see happen is that our council is prepared, that we're leading, and that we're trying to find ways of  creating affordable housing within our means and being ready to take those opportunities when they pop up rather than being the last cab off the block and missing them and find they all went to Matamata, Piako or Ruapehu because they're on the pulse and they're doing something about it and are ready to move when the opportunity's there.

We certainly don't get support from central government. They actively discourage Council, seems to me, to be getting into the social housing.  and retirement housing for that matter. And on top of that, and I know the cases that you're, I don't specifically, but I know cases that you're referring to actually exist in our community, but Waip\u0101,  I was going to say unfortunately, but I suppose we'd have to say fortunately, has got one of the lowest, if not the lowest, social deprivation indexes in the country. So when central government look at where they're going to put all of their social housing investments, they go to areas with a high social deprivation and WIPAR misses out. And so we're almost  the authors of our own misfortune when we've got such a, I suppose, a secure community that we live in, but that doesn't get around the specific cases. We've all got spots in the community and families that really need a lot of help. But in terms of looking at the overall government picture, we don't feature at all. A real challenge.",

    "text": "Thanks, Andrew.  I think that thanks can actually extend across the whole, from the whole committee, to be fair. You know, your passion for Te Umuru and its people is pretty evident in the way you both spoke. So, you know, particularly for people who are marginalized and might not have those voices or the wherewithal to find their way through that somewhat chaotic system that is the finding houses or finding jobs or finding help or support. So thanks very much for everything that you guys do. It's not gone unnoticed.  Thanks, Susan, and thank you to everyone for your time listening to us, and all the best with the rest of the submissions.",

So I guess we go back to our agenda.  And we have that recommendation there appearing on page five of our agenda, page of our bundle of documents, to receive that report from Graeme and to receive and consider paragraph B and then approve and then D, approve again.
