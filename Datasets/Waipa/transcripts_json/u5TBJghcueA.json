So, if everyone's happy, I'll accept Graham's apology. Can I have a mover and a seconder for that? Andrew and Bill, thank you very much. All those in favour?  It might be easier to wave than try and turn off the mute button. So, well, kia ora everyone. And look, a very warm welcome, Dominic and... Sorry about that. And Gabriel. I've got a...  notice came up on my screen, sorry about that. So look, with a couple of new members, is it appropriate to just quickly whip around the screen and introduce ourselves? I'm Jim Milchrist, Mayor of Waipa District, have been for eight and a little bit years, but I grew up around Waipa, did all my schooling at Te Aumutu College, and then went away to Wellington and Auckland for a while,  early in the mid-70s, I came back to work for Waip\u0101 County Council in those days. So, all my working career has been around this district and have a real close affinity for everything about Waip\u0101. So, yes, with that, if I go around my screen, is that the appropriate way? And  If it's not matching yours, I haven't, hopefully haven't missed anyone out. But Jim, your top left-hand corner of mine. Kia ora t\u0101tou.",

    "text": "Yeah, look, I echo Andrew's sentiments. I'd actually been pushing for this, for training of this nature or some form of assistance for probably the better part of what have been 18 months or so, I think, Kirsty, it had been about that length of time. And through various, for various reasons that had been put off or delayed or COVID obviously played a big role in that.  My motivation, I suppose, in asking for and pushing for that training was that it became pretty clear quite early on to me that there was a very large range of people's understandings of, firstly, the history, specifically in our area, which during our induction, I have to acknowledge Shane was amazing at trying to upscale and bring up to speed some of our members who were lacking in that space.  On a broader context, it was obvious to me that there were quite significant vacuums in understanding around the broader issues of the colonization of New Zealand and the history behind the treaty and what led to the treaty and what led after the treaty. And it was a really, as far as ground works, who were the outfit that presented to us, I thought it was a really, neutral's not quite the right word, but it was very,  It was very conversational, very blunt, but quite a sort of safe kind of environment to try and understand when you've got people who are quite well-versed at one end of the spectrum to those who really don't know, and dare I say it, don't possibly have too much interest of their own accord in the whole subject. So I thought it was a really, really valuable experience. And I guess from where I sit,  and it's become clear to me that there are kind of two parallel kind of questions or issues in play here. One is local government's jurisprudential kind of situation. It's legal obligations, you know, that bundle of obligations that we have there. Like, what does that look like? And I guess from an elected member's perspective, I don't really know. So I still want to have that clarified. So that's kind of one bundle over here. And then over here,  we've got this moral collection of obligations potentially, and that's related specifically to Waip\u0101 and connected to what happened here and the people that we live alongside, you know, and amongst. So I guess those are kind of, for me, two things that are still in play, and I'd like to hope that going forward we can not so much resolve those, because I don't think you can ever resolve those sorts of things,  but get a greater clarity on where we sit as an elected membership and what that looks like in practice for Waip\u0101. So that was kind of, that course was kind of the beginning of that process in my mind. And I think it was really valuable. It's a wee bit disappointed that not everybody could make it. We had a few people who were quite sick so couldn't, but I thought it was a really valuable experience and  I kind of, yeah, I've kept the links and hope it's still live so I can try and pull the occasional person I know and say, come look at this, come look at this. And yeah, some really cool interactive maps showing the loss of land in short timeframes and things like that. That's a really graphic way of trying to understand what happened. So yeah, well worth doing. Hope that kind of explains or addresses your questions, Bill. Sorry, I apologize, had to take an urgent phone call.  But that, to me, is the origin or the reason why we had that training. And as I say, I think for me, it starts with a bit of base learning, and we're going to have to build on that and look at what this looks like in Waip\u0101 for us going forward.",

    "text": "Thanks, Susan. Look, I concur with both Andrew and Susan there. It was, from my perspective, a good historical context, I suppose, in terms of the training.  And I suppose the issues really that I see that are pretty outstanding issues, not only for Waip\u0101, but probably for the country as a whole, is the issues about, and probably definitions, if you like, about co-governance and partnership arrangements, and just actually what does that mean. And I suppose I'm frustrated by the Crown  in setting new legislation and calling for consultation, co-governance, partnership, whatever you want in the different legislations that are imposed on local government without any real clear definition of what that means, how it's going to be funded, because the resources for both council and iwi are  I was going to say non-existent, but they're dependent on ratepayer base rather than a taxpayer base. So I suppose that, you know, the legislation that comes out, the RMA earlier on and the requirement to consult,  Then we get the Three Waters reform that we'll touch on a bit later. Probably the biggest shift in functions for local government, and we were cut off at the knees about consulting  with anyone, let alone iwi on that regard, told that we didn't know what the proposal was, therefore we couldn't consult. And then it becomes mandatory. And then we're set up with a  a structure that I think is going to cause a whole lot more confusion. So some clarity would be really helpful. And whether it's something that we could actively work on together to get back to government and say, look, you guys, it's no good having 67 local authorities around the country all trying to  to work out what the partnership arrangements are supposed to be, what the co-governance arrangements are supposed to be. Let's have some clarity and talk about it as a national issue rather than, as I say, a whole heap of councils putting their own flavour on it, which  may or may not be correct. So, I think it's definitely a, it was a good starting point, but as with the others, I think that it's just that a starting point and we need to move forward on it. Yeah. Well, so I don't know whether that helps.",

And there will always be a clash. It depends on the person who is delivering it what you're going to get.  Many people deliver that workshop different ways. Waikato Tainui will deliver the Treaty a different way and so will Maniapoto. They're similar. So if we're not understanding what you're trying to understand then we're always going to be at loggerheads.

So there was a limit on numbers.  but also there was quite a heavy component in terms of preparation that was required to be undertaken over quite a short period of time, followed by an interactive session online. And look, ideally, that would be in person, and we're keen to get back to in-person meetings. I think these conversations, training and conversations, are best done face-to-face.  In terms of what comes next, this whole conversation about training around tikanga and Te Tiriti, it needs to be further discussed with the internal staff team and strategic partnerships and the executive team. This is one of our core organisational values, so how we give effect to that.  but also then with elected members. And my understanding is Councillor O'Regan has raised the issue of treaty jurisprudence and for us to get a better understanding of that. So we need to look at what we can do to secure some definitive advice and get clarity on that.  The elected members, I expect, will want to have a conversation about their learnings and what that might look like for them as a collective. And I would expect that following that, there would then be some face-to-face conversations with Te Kanohi and perhaps wider. So look, we will come back in terms of the future training program, your worship you raised about,  We're going to have a M\u0101ori ward councillor. We may well have, you know, a different makeup of our council. We had quite a different induction programme at the commencement of this triennium, and we're keen to grow that with quite an emphasis on that.  on working with mana whenua and iwi as partners, better understanding our district and the significance, the cultural significance of this place that we are blessed to live in and to give service to. So we will come back, but certainly this has been a helpful feedback session. We will take on board your comments and come back. Thanks, Kirsty.",

    "text": " I know. But if I could also talk about, we engaged in Miriata Taurua to do a report with Ng\u0101i R\u016bt\u014dp\u016b and where we've been and where we're going to. But it did raise some things in there that I've actually forgotten, and Jim might remember them too. But the partnership that iwi has is the ICC is the partner. And the Ng\u0101i R\u016bt\u014dp\u016b is the administration of ICC. It's not the partner.  So we were engaged to, because there was not enough meetings in the ICC, Ng\u0101i T\u016bp\u016b was engaged, was established to do that. And that's where the consent notices came. But what we are trying to do is  We timetable the staff into our meetings so we're able to meet those, whatever the council is doing at that time. So we meet in during our Ng\u0101i Ritopu timeframes. But in doing that, there's a whole lot of other things you can't do. And sometimes it's the administration of Ng\u0101i Ritopu that gets missed because of the number of things that staff are doing within council that they bring to Ng\u0101i Ritopu.  like the environment strategy, the spatial planning, naming policies, they all take time. So we're actually trying to, we're doing it ourselves. We're going back to what we originally was there for, and that's administration of the ICC. But in doing that, it's really difficult to,  to do that now, because there's so much stuff that goes through the ICC, but it's not asking for import from iwi, they're just reports that are being delivered at the ICC. So actually the only thing that we should deal with at Ng\u0101ui T\u014dpia is the resource consent applications. Because if the agenda continues to go,  where the council is delivering all of its stuff on it, then there's no space for iwi. And the ICC is for iwi. It's for talking about iwi aspirations and where iwi is going, rather than what the council is doing.  So I'm not sure whether you understand what I'm getting at. If we can just kind of get that on some kind of understanding so we go forward together rather than not. You know, we're not the community deliverers. You can't come to ICC and deliver the community stuff to us.  Because Jim would have noticed that you can just about have a meeting or silence and you only have to listen to me. But because there's no impact to M\u0101ori on those agenda items. And so I just want to look at trying to make an agenda item in ICC that is more a partnership role between iwi and the council at that level.  because that's where the partnership is.",

So essentially, I've gotten the report that Taumata Aroha, which is our new water regulator, they became operational from November last year. And recently, they have released a series of drinking water compliance rules for consultation and that closed  end of February, start of March. So council have submitted on those. We're in agreement that the drinking water standards should be replaced, but not in their entirety. There's some technical details that we have submitted on. And similarly, the Ministry for the Environment have released a draft national environmental standard for sources of human drinking water. We also submitted on that, and I included a copy of council's submission for your reference.  as well. So again, we supported it, but not in its entirety. There's some technical points there that we sort of have highlighted to them. The other thing that's happening at a big national level, of course, is the three water reforms. Now, Jim, I'm happy to put this over to you as well, but in the report, I've put a bit of an update on where the timelines are at, just as an FYI, really. So I'm sure, Jim, if you wanted to speak to any of that now or at the end of my report, over to you.",

So we're looking on the re-consenting of that for a longer term solution, as well as a new wastewater treatment plant.  And so we've been working really closely with our kaitiaki members on the development of a Mataranga M\u0101ori framework and the execution of that, and also having some really awesome k\u014drero around site restoration and potential opportunities for native nurseries and that's within parts of the site that aren't going to be needed in the future.

    "text": " Thanks, Renee. Just following on from that, and we can take questions on.  on both Renee's and my quick update on what's happening. So Renee's certainly covered off what the, I suppose the Department of Internal Affairs has set in terms of a timeline for introducing the new four water entities across the country. As you'll be aware, WIPA is a partner in the  31, I think, now. It was 32, but Dunedin's been in and out of what's referred now to Communities for Local Democracy, which is nearly half of the councils across the country. And  it's about one and a half million of the population tied up in those council areas. And Auckland, if you take Auckland into account, it's well over two and a half, three million of our population, I suppose, uncomfortable with the four water entity model.  And that has nothing to do with the co-governance arrangements, because the Communities for Local Democracy, and I attended a meeting just on Monday this week, and I'll forward the information there where we made a presentation to Nanaia and  and the Green Party in terms of an alternative option moving forward. And I suppose the real concern for the councils around the country is that loss of control and being able to... Water and sewage and stormwater are such a key component of local communities and planning for their growth. And the concern is that  these massive water entities are going to be just about uncontrollable from a local community perspective. And if you take the Entity B, which is the one that Waip\u0101 would be involved in, that's the whole of the Waikato, Taranaki,  catchment, there's something like 20, there's 22 councils involved in that. And as I understand it, about 78 hapu. And how are they going to get that, I suppose, that local involvement with that scale of governance structure, I suppose, in terms of trying to plan for the future of the water infrastructure. So,  the main thrust and there's an alternative proposal that's been put forward to central government that still fully supports the need to obviously enforce the better drinking water and environmental standards. There's just absolutely no argument about the water regulator. We need to have  effective partnerships with mana whenua in co-designing the government structure and something that mana whenua are comfortable with rather than being involved in, as I say, something like 78 hapu in that region. So it's looking to alternative arrangements. We acknowledge that around the country, there are some councils that are really struggling to meet the standards.  And the suggestion being put forward is that, well, in the past, central government provided subsidies. And for Kihikihi, for example, is the most recent one around here. 50% of the cost of installing the sewage system for Kihiki was funded by a grant from central government. The other 50% came from  connected consumers, really, Te Amutu and Cambridge funded the other 50%, and then we pick up all the operating costs. Central Government has said that they don't see that they will be continuing to fund anything towards the Three Waters infrastructure. It's all going to have to be through charges. And  So the suggestion being made is that for those communities that because of their scale can't afford to actually put the infrastructure in place, then there would be a levy, a suggested levy on all existing consumers across the country. It would go into a fund that could be then allocated on a national basis on an absolute needs basis.  And just thinking locally, not for any other reason, I'm not picking on Kawhi for argument's sake, but water and sewage there is a real challenge for the Otahonga district. There should be some support from the country as a whole to actually get those systems up in place so that we're not  having septic tank effluent running out into the harbour and substandard water supplies. So we're looking at actually focusing the financial resources where they're actually needed rather than just across the country as a one size fits all.  So, look, I'm still fully supportive of the aims, obviously, of clean water and the improved environmental standards, but I think there's a better way of doing it, and so do nearly half of the councils around the country. So that's where we're coming from. And as I say, I'm more than happy to send out  the information I got on Monday. And it's, excuse me coughing, COVID. And it has a statement on iwi partnerships and just really wants to reiterate  that there is nothing in the proposals that we're putting forward that is designed to cut out mana whenua having an input into whatever structure is finally established. So that's a quick potted summary, but as I say, I'm happy to circulate that and the presentation that we gave to Nanaia with the 10 point plan on how we could move forward.  Gaylene, you have your hand up.",

    "text": "One, thank you, Jim. I'd look forward to reading that document. So the second thing is that I'll have a conversation with Norman and Julian.  They did the presentation on the stormwater to Ng\u0101i R\u016btopu, but actually, they should have included M\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori frameworks in their delivery, rather than just talking about it as a stormwater discharge consultation.  Especially when you're talking to a mana whenua group. I just just reading this report. I felt that a lot of the information that should have been given wasn't given. Because then Ngaru Topi would have picked it up ages ago and would have been able to be more informed about what is happening around that space.  Mataranga M\u0101ori frameworks is quite a discussion out there now. And what does that look like? I've probably been involved in a couple of them now. Because if you look at Te Ture Whai Mana,  What does that mean? What does that mean on a m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori basis? And I can guarantee you very few people will be able to give you a m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori view on Te Ture Whaimana. Rather they can give you what it is from a legislative view. Two, because this is a project that  I believe that mana whenua can work with council. Because one, it impacts us hugely. Anything to do with water impacts on us hugely. From a M\u0101ori view, it's just very different.  But how we do that together is we'll take a little bit of thought so that we can understand what our views are going forward, but not to be tarnished by what is already out there. My view is to have a view of the mana whenua that's on the ground where we come from now, rather than the peripherals matter  But not always do they matter. Because we have to talk about what is important to us on the ground, because we're the ones that look at it every day. And a lot of other people look at it from another view, from a governance view, which is very different to how we look at it. There are people next to rivers that can tell you what kind of plant grows there and what was there before.  But you couldn't get that always from a wider view. So what am I trying to get at? There are a lot of stuff in here, like you have kaitiaki members. What is that? You have a m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori framework. What is that? All of those have a concern to mana whenua because what is that? Nobody's discussed that with mana whenua.  And I could be barking up the wrong tree, but I can see it written on the paper, but I have no idea what that means. Which is pretty sad for a mana whenua group not to understand any of that.",

Is it easier to get the influences you're talking about in a more regional way?  structure than a massive, it's almost, well, it's in four, but it's almost a national structure. They'll be the four, just about the four biggest companies in New Zealand by the, well, not that they're gonna have a company structure, but in terms of business, they'll be one of the, they'll be about the four biggest businesses in the country. So how do we,  It's what I'm struggling with looking after the community. How are we going to have influence over what they do? And I just see it's just too big.

I've just, there's a statement in, I suppose, what the communities for local government are asking for is for the government to actually pause and stop rushing this change through, which is going to have,  long or far-reaching effects across the country for many generations to come. And once you scramble the egg, it's pretty hard to back up. So we don't really wanna get it wrong. But the statement that's been made in the compromise proposal, it's only fairly short and I'll just read it, but it's item three, which says, with respect to investment decision-making,  asset owners should actively seek to initiate authentic discussions with mana whenua at a local level that considers co-design and partnership arrangements that acknowledge and enable Te Tiriti-based pathways at a local and regional level. So that's what we're asking for, is for some time to develop those discussions. So look, as I say, I'm not sure whether we're going to have any success or not.

And so, you know, from a partnership perspective, Waikato Tainui is in one part and will cross two lines. I think it is two of the four.  And I suspect that that's true of others as well.

Hopefully we can take the report as read, subject to some feedback from the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee yesterday, which is relevant to the third paragraph on the second page of the report, and that's page 45 of your agenda.  Obviously, some concerns were raised by the committee yesterday regarding community engagement and some of the proposals. As a result of that, we think that we can still bring forward a report to Strategic Planning and Policy Committee on the 3rd of May, seeking to officially start a review of the policy and the bylaw. But because of the concerns of councillors yesterday,  yesterday, we actually want to have a longer period of engagement with the community before we actually formalise what those changes are going to look like. So rather than consultation in mid-May, we're suggesting probably a period of consultation with the wider community and with IWI.  And then on that feedback, we can develop firmer proposals for the committee to consider. On that timetable, the 28th of September adoption is looking more doubtful, but we can go into that in greater depth as we learn more from the community as to what needs to be done.  So Carl Tutte is here as well. He's the technical expert on this, but I just wanted to bring that potential timetabling change to your attention.",

This is our update on our district plan work programme and it involves discussions about the plan changes we're undertaking as well as national directions that we are involved with. So for those people new to the committee, Waipoua is working on putting its district plan online as an electronic version of the district plan.  It means that people will be able to go to a web page and be able to access the latest and most up-to-date version of the district plan. We're still ongoing with this. We're currently trying to work out how to migrate our GIS maps into the computer system that our e-plan provider is giving us. That's an ongoing work in progress at the moment.  Since our last meeting, the government has enacted the Resource Management, Enabling Housing and Other Matters Amendment Bill. In a nutshell, essentially, the bill requires us to insert medium-density residential standards into the residential zones within the urban area boundaries of Cambridge, Te Aumutu and Kihikihi.  These standards will allow people as a right to build three times three story housing on sections that comply and meet the standards. We are currently working on identifying what is called qualifying matters to see what residential areas we can exempt from the new medium density residential standards. And we are looking  at things like the flood hazard areas, designations, protected trees, character areas, and one matter we are looking at is Te Turuwhaimana and seeing if we can use the vision and strategy as the overarching document, resource management document for the Waikato to push back a little from the new intensification standards  as the more housing you put into a section, the more storm runoff you get and the potential for not bettering the health and wellbeing of the Waikato and Waipaea rivers. The only other updates there is on the plan change table, we are looking at getting a private consultant into progress plan change 23, which is the Papakainga.  plan change, it went on hold last year as one of the policy advisors who were dealing with it left WIPA. At the SPMP committee meeting yesterday, an undertaking was given by Wayne Allen, our group manager, to see if we could find funding to get an external consultant in to progress that plan change, which is a very important plan change that has just been  It's just been on hold for far too long.",

And the considerations, because it's, so what's happened here is we got this Plan Change 26, which Jo's talked about, which is the intensification of the residential zones. So that's one that was unannounced. It took all the councils by surprise. You have to do it. And what we're having to do is focus all our resources onto that because we've got a mandatory notification deadline of 20th of August. Good piece of work.  And so that's focused all our resources in there, and it's meant we've had to come off some of the other plan changes. That's the background. Going to executive tomorrow, the intention is, and we've done some ballpark cost estimates, the intention is if we can get some funding approved, probably from council's reserves, it has to come out of, then we'll look at getting a consultant on, as Jo said. So in terms of timing, probably if we got the funding approved,  we're probably looking at six weeks before we can get a consultant realistically engaged on board and briefed. We've got a very short window of opportunity, I suppose, to get a plan change prepared and up to our council before the elections break. So it's really tight. Realistically, what we're thinking is that we may end up having to push it out to maybe February 2023  just because of the election cycle, which takes our elected members out for two to three months, potentially. So we're working really hard. We'll work to try and get it up before they break, if we possibly can. If not, then it's likely to be pushed into next year.",

    "text": " Yeah, thank you, Jim. Totally agree with Gaylene around the silent files for the Waihutapu that we prepared for Waipa. And I think you'll find that those same conditions apply to those that the iwi authorities hold on our behalf as well. I know that all the ones we did for this area, we actually treated with that confidentiality.  So that doesn't mean say they can't be put on there, but you need to get permission from the donors or that information before you could put it on. I'll just give you that advice so that you're aware of their conditions around making public that information.  But what I wanted to talk about, Jim, was the public haunga. You know, we started this journey in 2018. We've got to wait till 2023 before we're finally able to do something. Now, I don't think council appreciates or is even aware that you're holding up something like 12 to 15 houses in projects that we have developed over the last three years.  And now we have to wait again. The process and the proposal itself for Papa Kong is quite simple, but you haven't even bothered to come and talk to us to show you how simple it can be. Because the problem that has been shown and all the examples that councils have put up are based on a context that's got nothing to do with the land that it's going to be built on.  And a simple fix, for example, for Waip\u0101 would be to say that papak\u0101inga on M\u0101ori-owned land is a permitted activity. That can happen tomorrow. And we need council to start thinking in our space for its purpose.  Papak\u0101inga is not about the laws of the country and the applications of council's proper purpose for land. It is about the better benefit of our land, M\u0101ori land, for M\u0101ori people. At the moment, that land is only fattening cows, for goodness sake. And we have looked at using it for a better purpose, especially in this housing shortage environment, to do a better purpose, to do a better benefit for our people.  Now, I'm really disappointed at the fact that we might have to wait till 2023 before I can actually get these houses built. I'm now at the stage in the design stage, for example, for the first of the group of houses. And the difficulty with these, that they don't have a, what would you call it, a marae association proximity.  under the current Papak\u0101inga, what we call a district plan, they have to be within a marae zone. Well, if the zone is only a couple hundred meters, you won't be getting any Papak\u0101inga. But if we extended that zone to, say, a radius of 10 kilometers around those marae,  you will have papak\u0101inga being able to be built for a better purpose for your community of ratepayers. So you need to sit down with us and talk about how we need to make this thing work for us, because papak\u0101inga is not a means to get on the property market.  It is only a means to get affordable housing for our mokopuna and our successors behind us after we've gone with the land that we own now. So I just wanted to put that down, Jim, so that we're clearly aware that we're getting tired of waiting. And you're putting people in worse and worse situation and worse and worse stress every time we have this thing deferred. And now this is the fourth time it has been deferred.  There's always something more important than papak\u0101inga. We can fix it for you. We can tell you how to do it, but you haven't even bothered to listen to what we say. Thank you, Jim.",

We have so the way of background on the 3rd of March we looked at and the scenarios and how those will need to be enriched  by, you know, aspirations. We've updated actually the scenario on the base of that. We had a few discussion of how we could take actually and push this forward. And one of the outcome of that was to split our evaluation framework, which will be used  to select either a preferred scenario or select an hybrid scenario which is a composition of those multiple items for the four different scenarios that I've outlined on the third page of my report.  So this is where we would look at assisting during the ZUI on the 21st of defining what attribute of the Maturanga M\u0101ori framework needs to be highlighted. So I would actually say this is a really important ZUI to have to help us  and really define how we actually select the scenario, how this spatial plan actually becomes a community spatial plan. So before we looked at writing what the future of WIPA can look like, this one is really about how do we pick and choose, what are the criteria, our basis,  for choosing that scenario. So that's what we will be doing on the 21st of April. So Tipinee, myself and another people within the project team are busy in the background trying to get that framework ready. We would be keen to send some documents ahead  of us, so hoping to have a 14th, which is, you know, the day before we all go on a wee break. So to have some documents sent out to all attendees for their review, so that on the 21st of April, we've got two ZUIs, one in the afternoon, one in the evening, and you can pick and choose which one. We will be actually repeating what we do in either of those two ZUIs.  so that we can actually define the evaluation framework, as I said, and then ZUI 4, following on that, will be about going through the assessment and really kind of starting scoring or discussing each of those attributes chosen on the 21st and how we, yeah, just selecting the scenario for ZUI 4.

It's really, as Vanessa said, and so the 21st will be important because the m\u0101tauranga is not something that I  taught up, you know, where you're the team taught up in a dark room. So it was kind of dark when we put it together, but it comes from the hui that we've had and your respective environmental management plans and key documents. So that's a summary of where that will be. So that's what the 21st is about, to say, have we landed OK here? And then following that will be the hui where the evaluation takes place alongside  of that multi-criteria analysis. I think that is an MCA analysis, which many of you have been part of in the past, just so you know.  We're expecting that there's going to be tensions between which scenario wins and which or part of scenario wins, both within each framework and across the frameworks. And that's the purpose of the evaluation framework. Just like here, let's take this for a spin and check it out. So mana whenua and iwi will be an important part of that discussion. You may be curious as to Te Taha M\u0101ori roto ng\u0101 k\u014drero nei.  And so we're very grateful that Shane has agreed to at least present an option or options of a reo name for the plan that will again come out for you. I mean, he tangata hum\u0101ria ia, so it'll be something that he'll put together and then we'll bring it out to you for your whakaaro as well.

    "text": "Oh, good. OK. So I thought I would start this morning by just running through some of the key dates for the elections coming up. So first one we've got there is the 21st of June. So that's the candidate information evening. We're going to be having that at Mighty River Domain. So we'll start promoting that shortly.  Nominations open on the 15th of July and they close at 12 noon sharp on the 12th of August. And we'll also start to be soon looking at running in conjunction with the Electoral Commission. There'll start to be a campaign nationwide to make sure people are on the roll. If people have moved, that they've got their most up-to-date address so that we can make sure that they get their voting papers.  and don't have to do a special vote. So that'll start happening as well soon. And we'll be starting with our communication campaign. So election day is 8th of October. We're hoping to have preliminary results announced in the afternoon and then declaration of final results sometime between the 13th and 19th of October.  So this will be the first year that we have a M\u0101ori ward. It'll be one M\u0101ori ward member over the entire Waip\u0101 district.  there is a method of calculation for number of M\u0101ori Ward members in the Local Electoral Act. And under that, we're only allowed entitled to one. So only those on the M\u0101ori electoral roll will be entitled to vote for the M\u0101ori Ward councillor. And so unfortunately, the next option to change roles is in,  potentially, likely 2023, potentially 2024. So that's not, if anyone's on the roll, that's not very helpful in terms of if they want to change over to the M\u0101ori roll to be able to vote for the M\u0101ori ward member for the local body elections. So unfortunately, that doesn't really  link up in terms of timing. New people that are joining the role, they obviously have the option to go on the M\u0101ori ward role if they want to, but there's not really many options at the moment for those already on that or not on that role who are enrolled in the general. So this is just a bit of a look at our  stats. We have got pretty good stats in terms of number enrolled across our district of those that are eligible. We're sitting at 93 percent. We have 2,487 on the M\u0101ori roll, so that'll give you an indication of how many people will be entitled to vote for that M\u0101ori ward member.  And we've got that 2837 not currently enrolled, so hopefully we'll be able to get some more of those on the roll before the roll closes.  So just a bit of information on M\u0101ori war candidates. So you don't need to be M\u0101ori. You are all on the M\u0101ori electoral roll or even live in Waip\u0101. So you just must be a New Zealand citizen on the electoral roll somewhere. And you will have to be nominated by two electors eligible to vote for the Waip\u0101 M\u0101ori roll. So it's someone that's on the M\u0101ori roll  or two people on the M\u0101ori roll in Waip\u0101 will need to nominate any M\u0101ori ward candidate. There's just a few restrictions about being a candidate that apply across the board. In relation to having contracts with council, over 25,000, there is a exemption process  with the Office of the Auditor-General. You can't be a council employee, but you could be a council employee at the time that you go through the process. And then if you were successful, you would need to resign and being subject to court orders under Section 31.  of the Protection of Property Rights Act that's in relation to an appointment of manager when you're not considered by the family court to be able to manage your own affairs that section.  We have a standard nomination form that needs to be completed, a $200 fee for putting in your nomination and candidates are also able to put in a picture and a candidate profile statement. The candidate profile statement  can't be more than 150 words. You are able to put one version in English and one in te reo, but they do have to be substantially the same in terms of their messaging, and they can be 150 words in English and 150 words in te reo.  So in terms of our communication campaign, as well as doing some promotion to make sure people are in the role, we will start encouraging candidates to stand and then we will have a separate part of our campaign when we're looking at encouraging people to vote.  We will be participating in the Local Government New Zealand What Makes You Tick campaign. That is a campaign that's been developed nationally with some national graphics and material and some of them that we can adapt locally. That messaging will also, part of the LGNZ campaign, also includes Te Reo messaging as well.  So what really one of the things I wanted to talk about today is  M\u0101ori participation in the local election. So we are keen to look at doing some targeted messaging for M\u0101ori ward candidates and voters. And we will be working with our strategic partnerships team to develop a list of platforms and contacts to make sure that we're trying to get our messaging out to the right places when it needs to go out there. But really keen to just hear from  You, if you've got any recommendations, either now or in the future, as to key contacts or platforms that you think we should be targeting with our messaging? Did anyone have any thoughts on that? Thanks, Jo.",

    "text": "Thanks, Haven.  Thank you, Mayor Jim. Thank you, Kirsty. OK, good afternoon, everyone. My name's Haven. I'm in the strategy team here, for those who I haven't met yet. So, yeah, the purpose of this report is just to provide that overview of the annual plan project and just to provide a bit of context up front. Every three years, you'll recall last year, we developed that long term plan, which is essentially a big financial document that outlines all the activities and services that council will do.  for the next 10 years and more, and also identifies the average rates increase over each of those 10 years. And in the years when we're not doing those long-term plans, we do annual plans, and this is the first of two of those to come.  Okay, so where are we at now? We have a draft annual plan. Council staff have reviewed all their budgets and landed with an average rates increase of 4.3%, which is really closely aligned to the long-term plan, which identified a proposed rates increase of 4.4%. So just slightly less than what that long-term plan document said.  Some of the key changes, though, from that long-term plan, there's a few of them. Just the main ones, though, are the Porongia-Naroto to Te Amatua cycleway has been pushed out by one financial year, and that's mainly to do with getting landowner agreements in place. So, staff are working to get those all across the line and then moving forward with developing that cycleway.  The other one that you might be aware of is recycling contamination. So we've had to put a little bit more budget in there to deal with some of the contamination issues we've had in those recycling bins around the district.  And then I guess the third key change is Waka Kotahi, who haven't been able to fund our urban mobility programme, which is setting up all those walkways and cycleways throughout Cambridge and Te Amutu. You might be aware that I've got a lot of big projects going on around the country. I think is it Transmission Gully has just opened. So a lot of those big projects may have gone over budget and it's meant that I've had to re-prioritise things. And that funding that was sitting there for our urban mobility programme  isn't there for the next three years, but we do anticipate it will come back in afterwards. Yeah, that's what we're working towards at the moment. The other one is just a few changes to timing and some of those capital projects. I think like this is a usual thing. So those growth cells, the main ones at the moment in the district are just outside of Cambridge there, as you drive out to Hamilton past St. Peter's, I believe. There's a lot of development going on and there's just adjustments to timing in those projects.  But yeah, based on those changes, we did an assessment against our significance and engagement policy, and we did determine that it would be prudent to go out and get a feeling from our community about what they thought about some of those changes.  So with that, we presented that draft annual plan and a consultation document to the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee last month, where they approved us to open up our consultation period, which is open right now. It went underway on the 18th of March, and it's open through to the 20th of April.  So a couple more weeks left of consultation. We've been going through a series of online events with different parts of our community that people can register to and attend. We've got a few more of those coming up over the next week or so. So if anyone's interested, jump in on those. It's good to hear from our elected members who present those. And yeah, essentially that's where we're at. So consultation will wrap up on the 20th of April.  I guess one thing to note is a lot of those meetings are online. We would have liked them to have been out and about in the community, but just our COVID protocols meant that it was  a prudent approach to do it online instead of getting out there too much face-to-face with people right now. The hearings, though, we'll see where we're at. If we're at a different stage, we might have those hearings back in the committee. So we're keeping air of where we're at with that. Otherwise, they will also be online.  Yeah, essentially that's where we're at. So unless Kirsty or Mayor Jim or anyone else has anything to add, happy to take any questions, do my best to answer them, just noting it's an organisational document and I might not have the context for everything in there. Thank you, Kirsty.",

So hence, even more so,  a desire to connect with the community through this consultation period.

And yeah, look, just knowing what's going to actually happen in the world, apart from the normal inflationary problems that we've got, but with this Ukraine-Russia war that's going on, it's going to have a major global impact. So we've just really got to be careful on what's happening internationally as well as nationally. So yeah, any comments or questions anyone has?  No? Okay. All right, it's a big document, but we're pretty much on track apart from those changes that we've, the significant changes that we've identified.

    "text": " Thanks, Jim. Just I thought that, you know, as Gaylene had said earlier, that this is the forum in which we we have our partnership discussions. And so I wanted to raise the issue of Ng\u0101 Roto. I have in a  in a wider iwi consultative forum. I have certainly made a submission in terms of the Apakura Runanga, but one of the, and I've put a few things in there and I just would be interested to get an update as to where we might be in terms of those matters, because I believe that there were submissions made on behalf of  a lot of people after what occurred at Wairoto or Ngaroto. And I was reading in the paper that Barbara Kruger had come to see you, Jim, and I think Gary, with a proposal to import some chemicals from South Africa and put those into the Roto. And there was a discussion there that said that  you know, iwi would need to be part of any decision-making in that regard. But, you know, my question is, when would we be part of that? Why it was that we weren't considered to be sitting at the table when that proposal occurred? And if, because there's, you know, another proposal, I think, that talks about a kayak and some zapping machine that can deal with the carp.  There's lots as people try to deal with what is a problem, not of our creation, and I'm talking our in terms of M\u0101ori. It wasn't us that drained those roto and caused this problem to be there in the first place. And the other query I had, and that might be a bit long winded,  and I see Brad and Hannah are both there, so kia ora to Brad and Hannah who have had this job and I know that the costs have blown out even in terms of looking after the dead tuna and the dead manu that came there and that's been done in a, if I could just acknowledge this and I'm getting off the point a bit Jim, but just acknowledge that that was done in a very culturally significant way  and I just wanted to acknowledge both Brad and Hannah's input into that, and Hilary's actually, into that. But the next one was the biggest way of protecting our w\u0101hi tapu, which it is for a lot of the mana whenua, is to stop the leaching that's occurring. And when the Conservation Board visited, the Waikato Conservation Board visited the site on  on Friday, I think it was, you know, they noted that, I think it's Finch Contracting, and I may be liable because we're online here, have a maze that they have right up to the boundary of the lake. Is there not something more that we can do to stop that agricultural contamination occurring?  in our wahi tapu.",

    "text": "Yeah, thanks, Bill. I'll hand over to Brad and Hannah maybe can talk about the, well, all of the issues that you've raised. But in terms of the contact that I had from Barbara Kuriger's office and the  salesperson, I suppose, for the chemical enzyme that they were proposing could be a solution to the problems we were having at Nauroto. I certainly met with them, as I meet with anyone who's got these ideas and  we've got to look for some solutions. But before we go effectively wasting your time, it's a little bit like the resource consenting applications, everybody that comes through my door,  I suppose, gets a fill to put on, is the proposition worthwhile considering in the first instance? And if so, then that kicks off the formal processes. And realistically, before wasting everybody's time, I wanted to know,  if that enzyme was likely to work and we needed some scientific background, and it transpires that there's not enough research being done in a natural environment, so it's not an option. The other issue that you raised about the  the canoe fish, it wasn't actually to kill the fish. My understanding was it was actually some sonar arrangement on a remotely controlled kayak that could actually determine where the fish were in the lake and what species they were. So whether they were eel or an exotic fish, but it wasn't,  a control method or anything else. So that issue wasn't going to impact on the fish life in the lake. But I'll hand over to Brad if he wants to make any other comment and Hannah on the lake. And in particular, that maize planting, I suppose, right up to the margin of their property.",

Just wanted to introduce myself because I haven't met a few of you before. I just wanted to make a comment. I think, as Bill pointed out, there's been lots of different people involved in this discussion today, and we certainly appreciate having worked alongside Ng\u0101ti Apakura in this response to the event over the summer.  To respond to some of your immediate queries, Bill, I think Mayor Jim has covered off that response. Partly, I think we, you know, we can't control different organisations coming to us with these novel solutions. And I guess the approach to date has been  We've provided a bit of an initial response to say, you know, thank you. You know, in the case of the Ergozyme proposal, we were able to ascertain that we didn't have enough scientific information to support what they were doing. We did invite them to share any further trial data that they might have in the future, but these would be considered alongside  other methods that might be used to improve water quality in the lake. I note that we do have our Reserve Management Plan process due to commence this year for the Ng\u0101 Roto Reserve Management Plan, and this will help to inform  our future management and restoration options. So once we get through that process, we can look back on some of these proposals that have been put forward that might be more novel alongside some of the more possibly scientifically backed in Maturanga M\u0101ori principles that might inform that future restoration. So certainly we weren't intending to go and make big decisions about what was to occur or not to occur.  without having input from Ng\u0101ti Apakura. However, we needed to provide an immediate response to this proposal, and we can come back to it at a later date. In terms of your question, Bill, about the finch land, for example, I guess this property alongside many others that adjoin the lake, we do identify that there's actions that could be taken to improve the situation, and we do need to continue  talking to those private landowners. And I'm hoping that some of those conversations too can happen alongside the Reserve Management Plan process when we can bring some of the issues to light. Sorry, I'm just seeing if there was one more query that you had. Sorry. But was there any other unanswered questions there?",

But I expressed concern about the tuna, the die-off on the tuna and the  The carp have come back in a significant way the other day when we were out there and they affect the ongoing life of our tuna there. So that's, you know, that was one of the things I was discussing. The possibility that we can get more water into the lake is one way of  that I'd like to see us explore, and that might have an effect upon the land around the lake. But what we heard the other day is that that process will, out of itself, bring about some carbon credits because, you know, Peat Lake and peat soils are key in terms of carbon and filtering of carbon into the environment. And I can't remember, there were three things  I think that those were at least two of the ones that the restoration or the continued restoration of our tuna in there. And the third one I had proposed was whether we had an opportunity to put poutai on the lake. And just going back to the fact that Apakura and others had  Island Par on that lake. And one of those Island Par, as I'm told in terms of Whakapapa, is now the reserve area and the area in which the sailing club is situated.",

    "text": " And I suppose leading on from that, and it's just not Ng\u0101 Roto, but it's all of our peak lakes have now had their water levels set in terms of a regional resource consent. And so, you know,  you know, in the past, the water levels were kept high in Ngaroto over the summer period and then drained out over the winter, which is the complete reverse of what happens naturally. But that has now been remedied in terms of setting the water level. People around that own property around the lake and finches have been mentioned here,  that if they continue to cultivate the peat soils around the lake, we'll only be able to do that for a short period of time because every time you cultivate the peat soil, they oxidize and shrink effectively.  So they will, in effect, be extending the size of Ng\u0101 Roto because the lake will actually flood onto their property. And that's what's happened on the inlet end, I suppose, of the lake where a large proportion of that dairy farm that adjoins the lake there is now pretty much unusable over the winter period because of the flooding that occurs there.  I've been involved personally over probably 30 years trying to improve the quality of the water in Lake Ngaroto and other peat lakes around the district. And Council's invested really heavily in  sorting out boundary issues, I suppose, doing boundary swaps to try and get the best esplanade or reserve around the lake that we can, fencing it off, planting it, and putting in silt traps and things like that. But there's still a huge amount of work that needs to be done. And you're right, Bill, it's nothing that iwi have done that,  made that water deteriorate, it's runoff from farming activities around the lake, whether it be direct from cow sheds or fertilizer or just stock runoff. So until we can control that, then chances of a notable improvement is probably pretty slim.  And I've dealt with all sorts of experts over the years that have come up with ideas, some of which I thought would work, but for various reasons, scientists said no, and from a cultural perspective may not have been appropriate, such as dredging the sediment, which is basically  farm effluent really at the bottom of the lake and topsoil that's run off because of the cultivation of those areas around the lake. But there are issues, practical and cultural, that dredging it may not have been an option, but it  looking at it and with my experience, it's going to be something radical that needs to be done if we're going to ever try and get that lake back to a reasonably environmentally sustainable system. But anyway, look, we're open to any suggestions and  Every, yeah, it's a public meeting, so every person that comes up with an idea, I'm more than interested to hear what they've got to say. And if there's a skerrick of a possibility in that option, then I'm more than happy to forward that through and consult, obviously, with mana whenua.  Marcus, I see you've got your hand up.",

The real plus is that, of course, the manu were there and they were herding them into a place and having a wonderful feed.

But in answer to that question, they are that small. You'd think that that would be the way you could do it. But I know that there's some key people that have studied carp and koi carp for some period of time.  I think one of the things that came up the other day is that we might not be able to do anything about it. And that just about brought tears to my eyes because I knew that they do affect our tuna.

And one of the ideas that was put forward by, and unfortunately he's now deceased, but it was Dr. Charles Mitchell, who was working on  research to bring back whitebait enanga into the Waikato catchment, but his theory was that the best way to control the  the exotic fish in there when they're small like that is to restock Nauroto with large tuna that will actually feed on them and eat them. But of course, at the moment, the water quality gets that bad that we end up killing off the predatory tuna that could take real advantage of all of those small  carp fry that are in the lake at the moment. So somehow we've got to get the water quality to a standard that tuna can survive in there, take the big ones out which can't be eaten or managed by the tuna and try and get a natural system going again.  but that relies on stopping that toxic algal bloom over the summer period because it just wipes out the tuna and obviously the eggs of those carp survive.",
