    "text": "Brilliant. And that also means, by the way, Andrew, I think at this stage when we break for public excluded, we will take a short break because I think I just need to confirm that the live streaming has stopped appropriately for all of us and we've got the right people in the room. So there we go.  Thank you. Thank you for that. Thank you for everybody tuning up. That's great. And particularly for staff as well. Is anybody suffering from Zoom fatigue? Don't put your hand up because we're about to go into a meeting. But if you are suffering from Zoom fatigue, a bit of  feeling for me as well, because it's amazing what the new normal is like as we go into these meetings. But it's also a blessing because we can actually get to see each other and keep things going in these extenuating circumstances. So, I guess, welcome. If this isn't the Audit and Risk Committee, we are in the wrong room and the wrong meeting, but I can assure you it is. And it is an extraordinary meeting.  And I appreciate, Ken, you making moves to enable this to happen. I think it is important that when we consider the committee's brief to have that overview of our planning, the key, well, they're all key items, but the particular items around the annual plan and the long term plan  do need our view now. So, I do appreciate the fact that you have facilitated that and that we spend an appropriate, perhaps not too long, but an appropriate time just kicking that through. So, I'm conscious also, members, that you have been living and breathing this annual plan.  So, what I would be keen for you to do this afternoon is just to use this as a chance to stand back or sit back and just reflect. There's no decisions to be made. It's not as if you've got to try and work out what the rate increase should be, although I think you're probably pretty well settled by the sounds of it.  it is the chance just to stand back or sit back, as I should be more correct, just to reflect, have we got it right? Have we got our risks managed? And I think that's the appropriate role of this committee. But having said that, I don't want to belittle the fact that  Leon. Welcome, Leon and Kat somewhere, I presume. Welcome along as well from our auditors. It's important that we hear from them to conclude the final missing piece, dare I say it, the fee piece, without being too direct. Leon, that was missing from the last time we met. And obviously, the stuff due to the items in public excluded are really, really important. So with those sorts of opening remarks and welcome,  Do I have any apologies for being able to stay the time? Because I think otherwise we're all here, aren't we? So there are no apologies to be sustained. Great. The matters are reasonably straightforward, but has anybody got a sense that their interests may cut across the matters we have at hand at all?  No, I don't think we've been informed, so that's fine. There are no late items that I have been aware of. Is there anything that you need to raise, Gary, either in public or excluded, that we're not aware of that you can't raise? No, nothing, Mr Chairman.  So the order will be, from my perspective, the order as we have it on the order paper. I'd like to move that we confirm that as the order. Could I have a seconder, please? Thank you, Roger. All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Those against? Carried. Thank you very much.  Right. So, here we go. So, confirmation of the minutes that we met last on the 9th of March in the Old World. It was a meeting which, as the minutes show, was substantially truncated because of the unavoidable loss of a quorum. But having said that, we're appreciative of reports and the work we got through.  Are there any matters of fact or accuracy for those of us that were present or even did any typos that we need to raise at this stage?",

Yeah, I've had to move because the man's here to mow my lawn, so my apology is probably not the best situation. Can you hear me now? Yeah, no, look, sadly we can't, or at least I can't, so I assume nobody else can. Yeah, you are very, very faint. Okay, bear with me, I'm going to move back.

    "text": "Apologies, why I moved was because the man is here to mow my lawns and I didn't want you to be interrupted by that noise, so that could disrupt. So I'll try and move quickly. So just in terms of where we're at, so Sarah Davies, the Manager of Finance, reported to this committee back on the 9th of March to provide an overview as to the key assumptions that underpin the 2018-28 LTP.  and how they needed to be updated in light of the development of the 2020-21 draft annual plan. So in reporting, Sarah spoke specifically to those key assumptions that were deemed to be of priority, and they related to growth, impact on rates, revaluation of non-current debt, borrowing and investment interest rates, changes in legislation, depreciation, and inflation.  I'm not proposing to go through and tell you what Sarah reported at that point. I'm assuming that you have read the reports from the 9th of March and for the meeting today. But as you're aware, we went out and publicly notified our draft annual plan on the 23rd of March, being the day that the Prime Minister announced we were moving into Alert Level 3. And obviously, we moved into Alert Level 4 two days later.  At that point, we didn't know the true impacts of COVID-19 on the New Zealand economy and or the global economy, but the impacts have been far-reaching. And to ensure that we better understood those, we engaged Brad Olsen from Infometrics to provide us with his expert economic advice as to the impacts, likely impacts, on the Waipara economy.  Attached to this report is the key pieces of advice that he has provided to Waip\u0101 District Council, being a general overview, having had a look at the LTP assumptions, and then providing advice as to the impacts on the Waip\u0101 economy specifically. That work has underpinned a comprehensive review undertaken by staff  to revisit our 19-20 and 20-21 budgets, looking at operating expenditure, capital expenditure, and the capital works programme, and also revenue. And so outlined in the report are the guiding principles that were worked on for elected members and approved by the executive team  to provide guidance to the budget managers in revisiting those budgets. Just one point to make that when we provided those, we were acting on the assumption that we would be in level four and that suspended capital works would not recommence this financial year. Obviously, we moved through alert levels quicker than anticipated.  and the timing for the reconnection of Capital Works was addressed as part of a further revisit of the Capital Works programme in more detail. That's referred to in the paper also. We had another look at the Capital Works programme, determining what was critical, what was priority, what had already been committed to by way of contract, and what was  able to be delivered and affordable for our communities. So I guess that gets us to the point that we're at now where I'd like to provide an update on those key assumptions that are now underpinning the work that we're doing in terms of revisiting the annual plan. And the point that has been earlier made with elected members is that this is a fast-moving environment.  there is a lot of uncertainty still in play here across our business and beyond. And so in all likelihood, whatever assumptions we adopt now are likely to be proven to be incorrect at a future point in time. It's acknowledged also that decisions made through the annual plan for 2020-21 could have a significant impact, particularly on year one of the 2021-31 long-term plan.  And so it's critical that we exercise caution and be prudent in terms of what we take forward and adopt later in June. So just in terms of now providing you, talking, walking you through those key assumptions, the first one that we identified as needing to be updated was growth impact on weight.  And this is a backward looking rather than a future focused measure. So what we're saying is that expected growth in rates is now 3.25% up 2.7 from the draft annual plan. This is not an assumed figure. It's a real figure. It's based on properties that have been entered into the rating system since the revaluation and which  quotable value has valued in the past two months. So there may be further properties that come on stream prior to the end of this financial year, but we've been conservative and have based the figure on what we know as it today. So then we move on to the next assumption being revaluation of non-current assets, and there's no change to what was provided back in March.  For borrowing and investment rates, this is one that has changed. So we have adjusted this from 2.5% in the draft annual plan to 1.5%, and that's based on advice from our Treasury advisor, Earl White of Bangkok Treasury Services Limited. With regard to changes in legislation, there is no change to the update provided on the 9th of March.  We assume there would be no changes in legislation other than those that had previously been signalled. So, for example, we are well aware of possible changes in the water services area and also in terms of RMA amendment. They are already on our radar. With regard to depreciation, there was no change to this assumption on how it was calculated for the draft annual plan.  there will be a small adjustment to the depreciation value due to the timing of capital projects. However, there has been no change to roading depreciation from the update provided in March. And in respect of inflation, that was removed from the draft annual plan as a means of reducing the impact on proposed rates increase. So therefore, there is no change to the update provided in March in respect of inflation.  for revenue, we are now forecasting a significant decline in non-rates revenue. And the assumption that we've relied on for revisiting the draft annual plan is an 18% decline in residential and non-residential construction. So that will apply in respect of building consents, resource consents, and also it's been applied in respect of development contributions.  This is based on advice provided to us by Infometrics. It is a conservative figure in that it relates to timing. So this is based on a March year end, and obviously the annual plan runs from 1st of July through to 30 June. So the advice from Infometrics is that if we were to adopt that July to June timing, in fact, that decline would drop back to something like 5%  Again, their advice was adopt a conservative approach and rely on that 18%. So in terms of, therefore, where to from here, we are continuing to have information provided to us by Infometrics that will be updated periodically. We are also sourcing information from alternative providers. So for example,  the advice and guidance coming out of the local government COVID-19 response unit, also Te Waka. So they have access to economic data provided to them through the economist engaged by Waikato Regional Council. And there is also, we've accessed data through the Solgham Community Wellbeing Data Service  and that is information that we have subscribed to to help inform the development of the long-term plan, but it will have relevance here in terms of the annual plan and the implementation of our work programmes moving forward. With regard to assessment to ensure compliance with the legislative requirements,  So, moving forward, we are required to assess compliance with the draft annual plan, the long term plan, the revenue and financing policy, and also our significance and engagement policy. And so the timing has been really tight. We're still working through the development of a revised annual plan.  but we are satisfied that where we're at currently, that we don't foresee a need to go back out to our community and further consult. But we are, I guess, gathering data, looking at detailed budgets across all activity areas of our business, and we will be taking independent legal advice if we identify a need to do so. I guess that just, we remain in a holding pattern and a watching brief there.  as we get more clarity around the figures. In terms of the process from here, so we are looking to, we have scheduled an extraordinary strategic planning and policy meeting for the 9th of June, and the purpose for that is to bring back a revised plan to elected members in a formal setting for them to provide feedback and for changes to be made ahead of adoption of the  annual plan on the 30th of June that's scheduled to be adopted by council to comply with the legislative requirements. We have scheduled hearings and deliberations for submissions on the annual plan. They will take place on the 26th and 27th of May. They will likely be held via Zoom. And we're just checking in with those submitters that wish to be heard  as to whether they are able to be available via Zoom. We've got 42 submissions. Of those, 12 wish to present, and of the eight of those that have been contacted, eight have confirmed that they are able to participate remotely via Zoom. So that's probably enough of an overview from me, but I'm very happy to respond to any questions from the committee. Thank you.",

You've probably heard a chunk of this, I think, even as late as this morning, if I've got that right, Ken. So this is just to be able to sit back from a risk perspective. Have we got a timetable that's credible?  And have we got our assumptions in the right area that you will feel comfortable gives you, say, a soft landing, the ability to make a decision in June, as Kirsty's outlined. Bear in mind, the last decision you have to make, my bit of advice, bit of a lecture, is you have to make certain the total plan is financially prudent, which is probably taking something of a  a slightly longer term view than just the immediate year. And that's the other thing that you've got to do. So come 30 years of June, have you got the best information and risks managed and are you prudent? And can you go ahead and make a decision would be the key things. So with that sort of opening comment, if there's any questions, I'll be really keen to hear what they might be or comments at this stage, please.

So, yeah, so look, I think we're in the situation where what we've shaped up is best information possible, but I think the other key to it, and this is something actually that the Chief Executive has had some engagement with our councillors on, is having a very good, you know, monitoring regime.  Yeah, we are certainly in a period of considerable uncertainty. So, yeah, so I know that Gary has been talking to the councillors about making sure that we have some really robust monitoring mechanisms in place so that we can be aware of anything that has changed unexpectedly. And we obviously will be able to be on to that on a timely basis to make the relevant adjustments.  So, yeah, and in fact, obviously, we would need to be doing that anyway, because, you know, very much the focus of the next year is obviously on our LTP document, which needs to be adopted by 30 June of next year.

And then, of course, is the issue of the Australian bubble and what that will do to our tourism economy. So there are so many unknowns. What we have done is we've taken a conservative approach. And to the extent that we might be wrong, we've also suggested to Council that they retain a significant  cash reserve so that when it comes in particular to year one of the next LTP, they've got a buffer in there to work with. And the other thing we've suggested is we've been struggling with how on earth we fund a recovery package. And the council has been working quite diligently  to make the best of its balance sheet by making money through arbitrage arrangements. And so there's about eight hundred ninety thousand dollars that council set aside from arbitrage. And we've had a chat to the council this morning and thought that  a really good opportunity exists for us to develop a robust recovery package that's in conjunction with the wider region and bring that back to the council for consideration as part of this annual plan package.

The question is, is there any reason you want to try and hold open, say, and it's not  other councils are not going into July, which, of course, is breaching the statutory date, but are going into July not because they necessarily want to hold open, but actually for them, the event of actually trying to deal with the expenditure reviews, the CapEx reviews, the assessments have become so difficult for them.

So, look, I love Brad Olson and his team at Informatrix. They're fantastic, and they tell a compelling story, but it's all high-level, you know, Mac pro-economics. And I'm really keen to get information source from WIPA businesses. Because, you know, then we will have a bit more  for knowledge, perhaps, of other people that are thinking about closing as well, because I'm really concerned about achieving, I suppose, a realistic annual plan that is affordable. And if you're just going on macroeconomic metrics, it's not necessarily going to reflect what is affordable for our district. And so I'm really keen that those other  sources like Te Waka and I thought Debbie mentioned, Debbie LaSalle mentioned that the Chamber of Commerce's were going to do some surveys of businesses as well. So it'd be really good to hear them because my understanding would be that they would be a key sector and that they're either going to shed staff and so create affordability issues for individual households  or they're the ones where we've got to make sure they take up the government assistance. Because what I've heard in the media is that they're not taking it up. And so that in itself could jeopardize a significant portion of our rating base. I'm also conscious that further down the track, or maybe at the end of the next 12 months, so still within our annual plan cycle,  we're going to have a lot of young people that probably aren't going to be able to get employment, you know, that are going to graduate at the end of the academic year. And I know that in other recessions, there's been a concerted effort locally to place those kids in work experience, internships, environmental projects, and that kind of  that would be a really good initiative for council to be seen to be doing. But it takes time to plan it. And it's also something where you collaborate with multi-stakeholders.

I think when we get to the end of the wage subsidy, which is what, three weeks time?

We hope that there's going to be some  injection to really kick starters back. And then, of course, there are those shovel readies that we've got in to the national agencies, whether or not any of those are going to affect us.

The question is, is that something that other ratepayers should fund, or is that something that, in terms of that sort of wealth redistribution, we look to central government to fund?

The other thing which is certainly being discussed, you will be well aware of, around the traps is actually a renewed reinvigorated disbonement.

So, we turned our attention to it in that context and also in regard to some of our water billings. So, water billings between now and the end of this financial year. So, yes, the council certainly have accommodated cash flow concerns. So, our focus was very much on  In fact, what we did do is we reduced the amount of penalty from the very much standard\u2014and standard right across the country, I believe\u201410 percent penalty. We dropped that down to 3 percent. We also put some other mechanisms in place that would allow ratepayers of both the fourth quarter rates instalment  as well as those water bills extended periods to pay. So we certainly weren't reducing the amount of the rates accounts or the water invoices, but we were certainly indicating that we were very open  to people having longer periods to pay. So, yeah, so that was put in place. Yeah, that only relates to those billings. So, yeah, so we do need to come back to Council at the same time as we adopt the annual plan with potential, yeah, rating penalty relief going forward into the new year. So, yeah, so certainly the intention of the team to do that.  In regard to your comment about payment arrangements or direct debit type arrangements, so look, Waip\u0101 already has very high take-up of direct debit arrangements.  My recollection, certainly the last time I looked at the stats, was that we're in the high 60% in terms of people who have chosen to pay their rates bills by direct debit. Now, in some cases, obviously, those are aligned to quarterly payments. I mean, obviously, it's at the discretion of the ratepayer themselves.  But often those arrangements are aligned to the quarter installments just so that people don't forget to pay them. They choose to take the direct debit option on that basis. But also in a large number of cases people have already chosen to run with monthly direct debits.  because, in fact, actually possibly even more frequently, you know, aligning it to perhaps a fortnightly pay, etc. Yeah, just to obviously make those much more bite-sized chunks. So people certainly have already, in fact, for quite some time have been taking advantage of those.

On that basis, we do have an opportunity to use a provision that's allowed for within our revenue and finance policy to slide a bit more  of the rate onto capital value and a bit less onto the uniform annual charge. So, we're going to model that and we're going to show that to the councillors. But equally, you know, we've heard this afternoon that, you know, the farmers are indeed having tough times. So, it's a model that we'll throw out for consideration during the annual plan hearings. Greg Morgan I appreciate that.",

I'd like to come back to that. Can I just have a couple of queries about the assumptions? I take it, I mean, firstly, what we're really saying is this coming year, 2021, benefits from the, you know, notwithstanding the last, the fourth quarter, the incredibly good growth you've  quarters of the year, which has been, Gary, I think, as you were saying before the meeting, astounding. So it's actually going to be the issue for the first year of the LTP. And I think you raised that, Kirsty, as being when the impact, if there's an impact on growth from the current position, is really going to take play. Right. I think that's essentially what we're saying. I think that's essentially what the metrics are saying.  Can I just ask a question about the assumption around borrowing in particular, Ken? We're a reasonably new borrower in terms of Treasury management. So, essentially, our total cost of borrowing, or perhaps we might say our weighted average cost of borrowing, can be assessed as relatively low.

So that's a, that's a fair point. Right. Look, I think, I think that's been a very good discussion. Thank you for that. Well done. Number two meeting for you guys this afternoon, today.  And it strikes me that we've probably discussed five things. One is actually people have used the word conservatism. I'd like to perhaps suggest we should rephrase that word and say we've tried to build realism into our annual plan. But note on top of that,  Gary, we've talked about the capacity for recovery package and I think that's, if I've got that right, you've talked about the tapping in on some of the value that you've created through arbitrage and the likes to deal with that. The shovel ready projects, which probably doesn't affect this  annual plan. But in some sense, we take as a broader package, we'll fit in. And we also talked about rates relief in Kenya, talked about how the rates department are very  happy and capable and flexible, dare I say it, in dealing with the individualized hardship of within the community, which makes a lot of sense. So, it does suggest to me that with the data\u2014oh, I'm sorry. And sorry, the other thing is the data that you've based your realism on and the fact that even between now and June, there is still some more stuff to come. And I think  You mentioned Steve Tripp from Te Waka and the work you're doing there, which meets a sense of wanting to make just, I guess, that double check, really, in some sense, that actually, you know, the local view. What I say as councillors, you should also work hard to know the local view as well, but that's been a wee bit trite. You're doing some decent work to also try and keep the local in your budget, not just the view of Informatrix, which I'm not running down.  Which leaves us then with the area that going into the new year, we need to make certain that that monitoring occurs generally. It's really important for a council law message as a governor.  But, Ken, I'd just like us to perhaps note that we should think how this committee as a risk committee plays its part. And I would just like to suggest that we think about the financial risks, maybe some stuff I'm looking at elsewhere, which would be useful, which might actually form a bit of a, at least for the coming year, I was about to say, a sidebar to our general risk reporting, which we should include as just a specific focus in terms of the  Sorry, that makes me ask one other point.

So, hopefully, that's reflected in the way Fitch ultimately report on this, Gary. So, I hope that's really helpful.  to sort of take a high level view of where we're at, I'd certainly feel comfortable. So, look, I'd like to then move to the recommendation, which is pretty simply that we receive the report. And, I mean, that seems like an injustice to some extent to the good work and the good report you've provided us, Kirsty. I'm sorry about that. But hopefully the  the nature of the conversation is one which shows you we've kicked the tyres on it and are pretty comfortable at this point as to where you've got the whole process to and the risks that are needed to be managed. So, I hope that's OK. So, look, I'd like to move that on back to the recommendation at section two.  that this paper from Kirsty be received. Could I have a seconder for that, please? I'll second it, Chris. Yes, Susan. I guess technically I should ask, is there any discussion on the resolution? But I think we've probably had a fair crack. Can I put that, please? All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Those against?  Thank you. That's great. Thank you for that. That's really superb.

And we just wanted to inform you or give you an update on that project and how it's been impacted by the pandemic and some of the decisions that have come from that. So it's all in the report. So I'll just provide a quick summary of the report and then perhaps open up for any questions and comments, discussion. So in terms of the LTP, I get the main impact, yes, is essentially those changes or potential  significant changes to the significant forecasting assumptions that underpin the LTP and how those might then flow on and impact our general approach to preparing the LTP.  which has been to carry on with our current one as far as practical with that extensive capital works program. There are other impacts that the pandemic has caused, including disruptions to the work environment, public spaces, and some of the capacity from key staff. However, as we're adjusting to working under these different alert levels, we're comfortable that those issues aren't getting too out of hand and we can  the main impacts are from the significant forecasting assumptions. So given that, the project governance group has endorsed a recommendation to be a bit more flexible as we prepare our LTP, especially regarding for the timeframes for some of the deliverables within the LTP project plan. That gives two main benefits for the council. Firstly, it gives us a lot more time to understand  the impacts from the pandemic on those significant forecasting assumptions. And it also has allowed staff to focus on other priority work, namely this current annual plan. So where to next in terms of the LTP project? Once the annual plan is completed, we will hone back into the LTP and we'll come back to elected members and check in on that overall approach to preparing the LTP.  And that discussion will be informed by the monitoring of those changes to the significant forecasting assumptions, the work from Infometrics, and some of the other data that people have touched on today, namely the SOLGAM data pack that we have access to, potentially some of the Te Waka  to work at environmental, sorry, economic data that we, survey data that we're gonna look at. And yeah, then have that discussion on our approach to the LTP. And then that will flow into re-looking at the external priorities and then deciding what projects go into the LTP and at what years. So yeah, we've still got those two risks, two very high risks in the LTP.  regarding key staff's availability and then delivery of the capital of the works in the LTP. But yeah, as the paper notes, we intend to move back to BAU and have staff focusing back on the LTP. And also from the work with the annual plan, we'll have more information about delivering that capital works programme. So yeah, I guess that's a quick overview of the paper.  So happy to open up for any commentary or discussion. Thank you.",

Some of those stats there project a population in 2050, which particularly for Cambridge has already been surpassed in 2018. So that's an indication that perhaps those strategic documents need to be reviewed prior to us looking at the activity plans for the LTP going forward. Now, I know that that's a big ask,  but there seems to be little point in having a strategic document that is not reflecting current projections and current needs and population trends.",

So, through the elected member induction, we identified and detailed for you the strategy work programme, which includes a review of the strategies  that we have in place. So, there are a number that were developed in 2009, 2010 that haven't been subsequently reviewed. So, we do have a programme in place to review those. In fact, we've commenced the review of the environment strategy we have on our radar to the commencement of the economic development strategy has also begun  and we have a radar to review the transport strategy that you refer to, Councillor Gordon, and also looking at developing a community strategy. With regard to the activity management plans, they are far progressed. There are a number of other strategies in place, such as our district growth strategy that informs our business cases and  and the activity management plans leading into the development of the long-term plan. So, the intention was, with the direction provided by the previous council and this current council, that we would maintain the current approach of the 2018-28 LTP, that we would commence the work revisiting with the community the vision and the community outcomes.  Once we had that feedback, it would help to then inform the redevelopment of our strategies, which would then ensure those strategies would drive the development of the next LTP, being the 2024-34 LTP, with very much a focus on building those Liverpool communities. So yes, there are some issues and some difficulties around timing. Unfortunately, it's not an ideal world that we live in and we haven't  well-progressed that redevelopment of those strategies as much as we would have liked to ahead of the development of the 2021-31 LGP and now we're responding to COVID-19. But I guess it's highlighted the need for us to be adaptive and flexible and partnering with adjoining local authorities and other agencies to ensure that we're consistent  in relying on the same strategic information.",

I just wanted to make a comment on on growth in particular as it relates to construction. I think the experience after the GFC was that  construction continued to be outwardly healthy for six months or so while the projects in hand were completed. It wasn't until that period. So, we are going to have, I would suggest, quite solid growth in the next six months in terms of households in particular. It's really consents that we need to be looking at  as soon as we're getting data coming through to see what's going to happen for the first quarter, first half of next year in terms of, you know, where our construction industry is going to be going.",

And so the Auditor-General letter outlined the review work that was being done on local government auditing, and that was around the perceived increased requirements on auditors  changes in growth within organisations, changes what need to be audited, as well as the competitive market for audit staff. So that was leading a perceived under-recovery of audit fees. However, due to the impacts of COVID-19, the Auditor-General has decided to hold our fees at a 1.5 per cent increase. So they've also advised that any cost for additional work that may need to be done  due to the impacts of COVID-19 will need to be recovered by the auditors, which will be in addition to the 1.5 percent and will be discussed with us in due course. So then, after that letter was received from the Auditor-General, we received the letter from Leon from Audit New Zealand outlining the audit proposal letter. This gave  the fee for the year end of 31st of June 2020, which was in line with the Auditor-General letter, a 1.5 percent increase. So,  but then didn't outline the years 2021 and 2022, and that was outlined in the letter as well. So we were happy with the budgeted audit hours. They're expected to increase from 815 to 957.

So, Cat and I really appreciate that we could attend this meeting. There were some really excellent discussions and very good work by management. Yeah, I must commend you on that.  Some of the things that as your external auditor like to hear was of course the conservative and prudent approach, that's music to an external auditor's ears, the realistic budget setting, re-evaluations and especially the improvement of asset data. We recognize the stress levels of all of you, councillors, management staff, to deliver essential services to residents. And I'm therefore really glad that John decided to cap the fees for this year.  and we don't have to add another level of stress of discussing an increase in fees. So that discussion we'll have next year, hopefully when things are a bit more normal.  Sarah touched on some of the areas that are the reasons for the increase in fees across all local authorities. And for me, the ones that I've seen over the last few years are, for instance, the changes in auditing standards, which include the Auditor General's expectation that we provide a quality audit.  So the amount of work that we need to do around revaluation, rates, grant revenue, has just, well, it increased quite a lot. I think it more than doubled in those specific areas. Then one other thing is, of course, the WIPO specific area, and that is growth. Although that makes the audit interesting, it does add quite a bit of risk to us.  And then lastly, one of the other ones that Sarah also touched on was audit staff and the availability of audit staff. I mentioned to Bruce yesterday, the day before, that my own daughter refused to work for us because she says she gets paid just enough or the same as my audit staff with much less risk. So we have less and less people coming into the auditing profession, making it a bit tougher to have staff available.  I'm happy to take questions now, but I want to touch on the impact on this year's audit just at some stage, Mr Chair, if you don't mind.",

And so for me, it was, you know, I'm still new to WIPA, but working through that last year, that's where I got to. As far as the impact of COVID-19 is concerned on the audit, we've been auditing from our little bubbles  for, well, even since we went into lockdown, the Hamilton and Tauranga offices actually went in one week earlier because some of our staff were exposed to someone who may have been possibly exposed to someone who may have been, yeah. So we take it rather seriously and we are very careful. And so we went into lockdown earlier and we had to work through areas that we can actually audit.  At the moment, things are actually going rather well. And as long as we all, I think for me, the main thing is this something I wanted to bring up a bit later.

    "text": " Yes, I was relating the story yesterday to Leon, which admittedly comes from the internal audit side, not the external audit side. But Leon and I were talking about an old colleague, Mark Maloney, at Auckland Council. He's the Chief Internal Auditor. And they have been able to carry out a full internal audit programme working remotely. So, New Normal has forced real changes onto the way in which auditors are able to work generally. So, it'll be interesting to see, Leon, how that goes.  Are there other questions or will I get back to my list of questions that Leon knows is probably going to come? Leon, look, I thank you for the absolute honesty of this letter. You realise, by the way, if I can just talk to you directly, I might not have read fully this letter when we spoke yesterday. So it actually answers a good number of my questions. But I would like to reflect. One thing I said to Leon is I'm  less inclined as a chair of an audit risk committee to have too much of a time on audit fees as long as I get a sense that we are getting a quality audit and getting good service. That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't negotiate fees.  But it does mean that I think we should have less stress over fees if there is good order, if there is good service going. It does suggest, by the way, Leon, that there is quite a mountain here when it looks like the fees that we'll want extra in the next year is in the order of around about $30,000.  And I'm not\u2014you know, that's for negotiation later stage. But I do appreciate that this letter is a good starting point in terms of transparency about where\u2014and let's depersonalise that the Auditor-General has said that he  at fees across the public sector. So, I'm not defending it, but I'm just saying thank you for being upfront that that is it. And if you need to understand what I'm saying there to my colleagues, look at the second paragraph under the fee, which says the estimated cost would be actually $182,000. I think it's inclusive GST, which is about $32,000 higher than our fee last year.  So it's a strong indication that actually when the Auditor-General says in his view that it is under recovery, that is actually at a reasonable hit. So the 1.5 percent seems like a gift horse at the moment, but it doesn't put off the fact that recently soon we'll have to have a serious discussion around the fee for next year.  I think it's helpful. One of the other things I've tried to\u2014Leon and I have talked about, and, Ken, you have sent me emails from me\u2014is about how do we front load the issues to make the audit reasonably capable of being done in the time and in the stress.  And actually, I appreciate your points here about why the hours are going up and obviously the fees going up as a result.  I just thought if I could ask you three questions in relationship to, I mean, it's partly extra hours, but it's actually also just understanding what you're doing. So yesterday you described to me the nature of the work you have to do for an asset revaluation, which can I say has changed substantially since I was an auditor. So can you just give us a sense, Leon, for the rest of the  Mitty, revaluations, I think, was the first item in your arrangements that are saying this is a key audit matter for us, but can you tell us what you actually have to do these days? Rough, you know, thumbnail sketch.",

    "text": "Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, it's something we don't always put in words, but it's interesting. About 10 years ago, when I was still auditing the Wairarapa Councils, we'll get a revaluation from a valuer, say thank you, put it on file, and that's it.  These days, you have to interrogate all his assumptions, look at his expertise and technical expertise, look at how assets are made up, the components, look at the component prices, look at the indices, and see if his assumptions are actually reasonable. So the amount of work, as I said earlier, really increased a lot by probably  well, at least doubled, if not more. And I don't think we ever kept up with it. So this, well, that's the example around revaluations.",

We're doing much more on rates as well and because of the court cases there were and so forth.  Non-financial performance reporting, same thing. They are just some extra complexities. One of the study things for me was the TIA measures and the colors.  So I've got an audit manager who's actually colorblind, so he can't audit that because he wouldn't know whether the colors are right and they have to be 100% right. That's right, yes, yes.",

And the one risk of growth is that you actually may not meet your levels of service.  which becomes a bit of a critical issue. And then, of course, normal expenditure, but also the capital expenditure to be able to cater for the growth. And I think capital expenditure is actually not that difficult, but then what are the future operating expenditure required for the new extra capital expenditure?

But if I leave you with my last question, or it might be that, in fact, Sarah has to answer it, but Section 7 has the assumptions relating to the audit fee, which is where, potentially, we can form\u2014I'm going to say fell, it's a bit drastic\u2014of the assumption, and there can be a request for extra  extra fees, which is still capable under the John Ryan solution.

After the recommendation of last year's audit, we have actually set up an annual report project group and we are running it in a little bit more of a project managed way. Now, I am aware that last year, obviously, we had a few issues because of the cloud transition right at the end.  of the financial year, and unfortunately, there were just things we couldn't produce at all, and then some we couldn't produce within the timeframes required. So, it was a bit pushed last year. I don't expect any issues this year from that perspective. And like I said, with the recommendation of audit, we have implemented that annual report project group, and I think that'll actually have a positive difference.",

And if it's feeding into the communication dynamic that you raised, Leon, that's even better. So thank you, Sarah, for that comfort. That's great.  So, look, I think it probably leaves it then to you to wrap up your final comments, Leon. Perhaps with my little request to think about actually how do we front load issues? How do we take the issues that could trip us up and have in the past like revaluations out of the end of year battle, if I can call it that, and have ourselves more clear on those bigger issues so that it is really a genuine case of you wrapping up and doing your testing that you need to do without  with minimum risk that we have issues that trip us up at year end.",

So we're coming in in June, or well, if I say come in, we might come in through the internet and not drive up. But so we plan to look at revaluations in June. I think it's early June. And that has been agreed between Sarah and Kat, I'm sure. I hope, I'm not lying.  But that was the plan. And that is the biggest thing for us to bring forward. If we can get that piece of work out of the way and we're all comfortable with that, that's a huge part of the final audit and that can go wrong.  at year end.",

    "text": " Yeah, that's really positive. So infrastructure assets were last review last year. So, and they'd be done every two years. So this year is just a fair value assessment. And if it doesn't trigger a valuation, that's great news. So we'll work through those and confirm that. And then the other one is land and buildings. But I think that's actually due this year for a reveal. Wasn't it done on Sunday? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. And that's the other one we'll try and do early this year. Sweet.  What I mentioned about COVID-19 is, of course, we will need to be agile, but there are some positives out of this. So we also charge you for disbursement, travel of our staff mostly, because we don't have too many stay over. And then, of course, we budgeted $2,000. Last year, it was over $3,000. So we charge them on a reasonable and actual basis.  Now, this year, we haven't been on site lately, and we're not even sure we're going to be on site in June. So at least some good news out of this is that the disbursements may be a bit lower. And we're also looking as an organization, do we actually need our staff to sit at the client site a whole week or do they need to be there two, three days a week?  that that reduces stress on both levels, and also focus our staff on, you need to get this done so that you can go to the client on Thursday and ask your specific questions. Well, if you can't send it via email. So those are things that are impacting us and how we're going to try and work a bit differently as well, and hopefully even more efficiently, because that's going to be critical in the future as well.  One bit of information that I think John, the Auditor General, has put out there is about priority audits. I don't see this impacting at the moment, but I have to raise the risk that there is a remote risk.  that you know if something if we don't have staff if we can't get supplementary staff from from other service providers or he can't get enough staff to do certain work he'll have to focus on the 52 billion being spent because that's what taxpayers are going to ask about he has to focus on on the controller function that the money is actually spent correctly as per the the the budgets for the government  He may have to focus on big audits like IRD, MSD, and he may decide that smaller audits will have to be pushed out. So this is just me raising a risk in an open, transparent way. I'm not saying it's going to happen.",

So you're all chocolate biscuits and morning tea, if that's the case.  Are there any other questions for Leon? I think we've had a pretty good go. Thank you for a very transparent letter, Leon. I do appreciate that. This is a recommendation that actually has a wee bit more to it than just receiving. And I just want us to very quickly look at it, because this is an area where we exercise a wee bit of work as a committee that's a bit beyond just receiving. So, obviously, we will receive the report. Again, thank you for both your report  Sarah and your letter, Leon. So, it is that we approve the proposed spend on the fee of $136,596, which does exclude disbursements in GST. And that is the amount which, if I've got it right, is the 1.5 percent up on the prior year's fee and is consistent with the Auditor-General's express intent.  And thirdly, we approve Jim signing the audit proposal letter. Reasonably straightforward, but as important, we have got the delegate authority to essentially commit quite a chunk of money to getting this out of the way. So, I'm quite comfortable as the chair to move this motion. Do I have a seconder?  Do I have a seconder? Sorry, Roger. Thank you. I was looking at the other end of the screen. There we go. My mistake. So thank you, Roger. You second. I think we had a pretty good discussion on this. So I'd like to put those three motions A through C. All those in favour, please say aye. Those against. Carried. There we are. That's strong information. We got you there, Leon. So thank you. And we do look forward to you working  and communicating well with Sarah and her team and vice versa as well. Sarah, again, thank you again for the good news that you've got a project group underway. We need to move reasonably fast on to the rest of the agenda. I'd like to suggest that if  to work just to make certain that we are all uncoupled and go on to PX. I'd like to suggest that we take a five minute break, if that's OK with everybody. So, look, I'd like to move again from Chair that for the reasons that are stated in the recommendation,  that the two items we have under public excluded be taken, indeed, in public excluded. And just for clarity, Leon and Kat, you're welcome, from my perspective, to remain for the meeting for that session. So, essentially, public excluded. Could I have a seconder for that, my recommendation, please? All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Those against? It's carried. It's quarter past, according to me.",
