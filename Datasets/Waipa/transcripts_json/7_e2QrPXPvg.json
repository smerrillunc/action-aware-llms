    "text": "Okay. This is just to back up the submission that we actually made. Just to talk about community boards. A community board is an elected body that works at a grassroots level.  in the specific geographic area that they represent, which is termed a community of interest. And the local government commission said that a community of interest is the area to which one feels a sense of belonging and to which one looks for social service and economic support. Geographic features and the roading network can affect the sense of belonging to an area. The community of interest can often be  by the access to the goods and services needed for everyday existence. So people like to know that there is someone or a body that they can come to for all sorts of reasons. And community boards, we work at a grassroots level in our specific geographic area. We have, in our meetings, we start with public forums. So we actually get  quite a few meetings where we will have one or two and sometimes even more people coming to ask a question or make a suggestion. And this is good, particularly when we get suggestions about things that people would like to see in our community. This also happens at the Lions Market once a month where Deputy Mayor Liz and I  try to attend and we get quite a lot of people will come and they will ask about, or make suggestions of things that the community boards could be doing. And we also at the start of, as I say, the forum we have, of the community board meeting, we have a forum. So anyone's welcome to attend and they usually work quite well. The other thing that we as community boards do that's quite important, we've just done this recently,  is to make decisions about applications that have been made for the community discretionary grants. And because we're locals, we have an understanding and knowledge of the groups actually making these applications. And I'm sure this does make a difference to how grants are made. I think if it was left to a wider body or a body that perhaps didn't have the knowledge of what goes on in our community,  it wouldn't be quite so successful. And the other thing that happens, all of our board members are known in the community. They're approached on a regular basis by the public asking questions or making suggestions about our area, which is  You know, one of the really good things, and quite often our board members will come back to the board and say, hey, somebody has suggested this, so this is really good. We also have board members who are representatives to the committees or boards of various community organisations, such as the Cambridge Museum, the Cambridge Community Social Services Committee, the Cambridge Tree Trust, the Arts Council, and others.  And these are really important for linking those groups with the community board and ultimately with what goes on at a higher level at the council. And I think this has been really appreciated by a lot of these groups. The board also takes the initiative in just some activities around the town. And in this current term, we've established  some new community vegetable gardens in some of our reserves with local residents acting as guardians. And these have been very, very successful. So far, we have three of them and we hope to have some more. And they're really helpful and people really enjoy being able to go and pick some fresh vegetables. No questions asked. It's great. We also do things like we've continued with our Christmas tree light project.  We run the ANZAC and Armistice Services in conjunction with the RSA. These are really big events in our town and I think it's appreciated by all the community that we actually do this. We also run a very popular little library which was in an old telephone box that had been donated to the town by the  old New Zealand post office when they decided they no longer needed a phone in it, but we've adapted it and we've looked after it. And that's a very popular thing that we do. And there's hardly a day goes by where at least one of our board members is not approached by a member of our community for some reason, be it a query or a suggestion. So as a board, we're the people on the ground for the  local authority. So we enjoy doing this. We think it's important. One of the other things we do that's really important and one of the reasons that I think that quite a lot of people in our community appreciate it because we often get suggestions is we run community board awards, which go to deserving members of our community. Already this year, we have done three of them.  These are always top secret events from the recipient. Somebody will suggest it and usually that are well known and respected in the community. And we have gone about and we have surprised them with an award. And it's usually a great event for them and their friends. Always happens at our board meeting and the award is made and the lucky recipient  and their friends and family will go off and they'll have a bit of a celebration somewhere. These are really great events. We enjoy it. And I'm not sure that the council, if it didn't have boards, would be doing these. And we have a list of people still that we want to award things to. So I think that's just one of the reasons. Those are just some of the reasons we think that community boards are important.",

Because I've just seen some of the submissions, you know, there are some that still don't see the value or don't see necessarily or know who community board members are.

When I went to community board conference, that that was an issue that was coming up, that not everybody knows that there is a community board.  I mean, it's the same goes that a lot of people don't know who their councillors are either if there's a council. So I'm not quite sure.

Yeah, I picked up what you said about community boards should represent the community of interest and access to the service or the service town, the hub. So my question to you is, currently we have the Maungatotori Ward.  which encompasses, you know, along with a bunch of other places, but Te Meroa, Mangakawa, Fencourt, Whitehall, Karapiro, Monavale, for instance, and also further up into the foothills. So by calling it Mangatochali, are we sort of disenfranchising a large part of the rural ward? And a suggestion was made that it could be called the Cambridge Rural Ward. Just any feedback on that.",

    "text": "Thank you.  M\u014drena koutou, your worship, the mayor, councillors, staff and members of the community watching. The majority of the Te Aumutu Community Board would like to highlight these main points in regard to the representation review. One, we support the reduction of councillors to maintain a level that is consistent with our Waip\u0101 population. The boundary changes to enable a fair spread of council have a say in what their ward is named. Two, we support the continuation of community boards because  It is a democratically elected board that advocates for the respective subdivisions, in our case, Te Awamutu, Kihikihi, and the rural subdivision requested a breakdown of. Community board is going to be even more valuable with the reduction of councillors, as they are going to have even less time to interact with the community powers to the community board. We do a lot of unrecognized work that the public and councillors do not see due to counter  community board having a very limited public profile, credit is not given appropriately. And until recently, we really reported to council outside of our annual reports. One councillor can do what is required for community board and some of our board prefer we went further and had no councillor representation.  C, we already have appropriately elected subdivision members to ensure fair representation of both. They should not be able to vote on matters that they get to make the final decision on at the council table. Principal Policy Advisor at Local Government New Zealand, Mike Reid, says in relation to community boards, their effectiveness depends on whether the council gives them any decision-making role. And so it really comes down to local context. Seriously,  and given the opportunity to have more responsibility and feedback directly to council. A seat at the council table with speaking rights could be a step in the right direction. So to sum up, are community boards relevant in 2021? Absolutely. They are for exactly the same reasons they were established. Te Awamutu, Kihikihi and Kekepuku need their own voice. Councillors are supposed to be advocating for Waip\u0101, not the individual ward.  We need to provide a mechanism to improve, I'm sorry, empower community engagement? Definitely. Regardless of all the fancy ways to communicate, people still want and relate best to having a person to speak to, someone who listens and does their very best to help them achieve. Impacts of COVID is our lack of connection with others, and connection is community board's key attribute. Does evidence show we are making a difference?  Through community board efforts, we have urban miners now operating in Te Awamutu, have removed a good deal of wattles from Kakapuku, conducted a rural tour. We address many issues that come to us via reports, getting footpaths mended, raise issues that otherwise fall on deaf ears, such as the George Street car park and Pollard Street lighting that we are still working on. Our achievements may not be huge, but they are many and mostly unseen.  Our council has not set anything for us to achieve other than to allocate the discretionary fund, which we conduct in a fully transparent manner, with the added benefit that we know of many of the organisations and what they do through our own networks. What we do is not easily measured by outcomes, benchmarks and KPIs, because our job is about connecting with people and community.  Are community boards meeting the ever more complex two-way communication needs of communities? Yes, via our public forum, direct networking with various community groups, the rural tour, we are increasing engagement on social media, particularly Facebook. We have key connections in our communities and we work at the grassroots. We do not need to be doing the council comms job by providing a full complement of communication channels.  That kind of duplication would be a waste of the ratepayers' money. More importantly, are community boards meeting residents' and ratepayer expectations? Most of the people who use community board services believe so and indicate accordingly. As an example, I am frequently being thanked by people for the articles in the papers. The fact that they do not complete your reviews and surveys does not mean they do not value and appreciate what we do as a community board. Value for money?  Yes, community board currently costs approximately $200,000 per year, of which members get approximately a quarter. However, despite the current total cost, that is the equivalent of $10 a year per rate payer in our subdivisions. Right now, with the many changes that are coming from government, with the reforms, the impact of COVID, and the changes in our council, we need some stability.  There are some possible alternatives to community boards. Let's explore these, test them, get feedback, rather than act in haste and throw the baby out with the bathwater. At this point in time, for the foreseeable future, community boards are a trusted and reliable mechanism that listen and support the needs of our respective communities. Kia ora, raua atu.",

It'd be actually nice to actually get a copy of what you've just read out because the submission sort of states some things but you put a lot more than just the submission into what you've said.  And I really do think it's time, and I'm really talking to council staff here as well, that we actually look at this seriously. I mean, there's a lot of good points brought up there and a lot of them that's not the first time I've been brought up. And I think on both sides of the swamp, so to speak, the community boards are open to change and open to change for the better. And I think it's really time that we sit down with the right people in the room.  including Gary, to see what these folks can do. If they're offering to do more, what can we get them to do? How can we maybe resource them? And as Liz pointed out, how can we help them actually lift their profile while doing that? So, I really would like a copy of that to go to all the councillors, and I think we should be bringing that back to a meeting. So, I'll lay that in your court there, Ken.",

    "text": "Yes, good morning, everybody, the mayor, the councillors, and anyone else that is there, community groups. Now, the Prangi Award Committee  Now, this committee was actually formed by the previous mayor, Alan Livingston. Now, Alan felt there was a need for this committee to be formed, and we have representatives from all the little rural communities that there are on this committee. Now, we've heard a lot this morning from the previous two, sorry, the previous two community board  chair people. And I'm sure they do a fantastic job. I'm not aware I've learnt more about what they do do this morning than what I knew before. But there is a cost to this. And, you know, we've heard the figure of $54,356. Now I can tell you, the Prongi Award Committee costs nothing.  Yes, we do have a council employee there taking the minutes, and we have two councillors there. And it's only just come in that we can now claim the mileage to attend the meeting. Apart from that, there is no cost at all. But we do not do the rural tours, that is a point of difference.  We do do the discretionary funds. We know our rural communities because we're representing those rural communities. Rural people know what happens in rural areas. And looking after the Porongi Award area is important to that committee with the decisions that we make. We hear a lot about what goes on with council. I don't think it would be too much different to how the community boards operate.  And if there is to be a review of the community boards, surely it has to be looked at as to those community boards actually becoming committees, like the Prangi Award Committee. We all volunteer our time. And as I say, we represent the people.  Council often shoulder tap people or we are asked for people in areas when we have someone who retires from the committee, they need to be replaced. So people are actually identified by people who know these people rather than an election for a community board member. So  We believe that the community boards, as they are, they do a good job, but if there is to be a review, we need to actually review also the Prongy Award Committee, because we're at the mercy of the mayor, the incoming mayor, and councillors as to whether this Prongy Award Committee will continue at their next election. So far, we've been lucky, but there's nothing to say  that if there is a change of councillors and mayor, that they may decide no. If there is some review and it is to be rolled out that community boards are for Te Amutu and Cambridge remain, should we be looking at a community board for Porongia? That way, our views and our representation  is actually guaranteed, whereas there's no guarantee with a committee. With the Prangi Award Committee, the proposal is that we only have one councillor rather than the two very efficient councillors that we have at present.  we feel is unfair. The rural areas actually are longer. There's a huge distance for people to cover. Rural people actually pay a lot of money in rates. You've got to go and find a lot of houses in town to get the same rateable value that you do from rural people.  I know that the numbers that each councillor actually has to work with of people living in an area needs to be averaged out to all the councillors. And if Kaipake was to remain in the Prongier Ward as it is at present, your figures would be  distorted. At the moment, the proposal is that the Pirongi Award actually has the highest numbers of residents per councillor than any other councillor in the proposal. You can have a plus or minus of 10% to the figure that you actually have said.  Looking at it, we only need 172 more people to actually go over the plus or minus, being the plus on top. And if we had Kaipake still in, as it is presently, there's more than 172 people living in Kaipake. Kaipake contributes a lot to the Prawni Award Committee, and we need  Kaipake in there. Kaipake has been, in the proposal, removed in order for the figures to balance. And if we had more people, and if we had a truer, my understanding is these figures, population figures, actually go back to the 2018 census. Now, that census was the census that was almost  Well, I'm not gonna say it, but it's the census that was the least correct census of all. And many of you will remember the controversy that was held over the figures that actually came out of that census. Has the council actually looked at the population growth in the schools?  I believe there's more than 172 people living in the Pirongi Ward area taking away kaipeking than what there was in 2018. We in the committee believe that we need two councillors. We have both councillors attend our meetings, which we meet in chambers at the council building.  This next coming year, the plan is that we will meet in different locations. So like the community boards, we can actually see what people are talking about when they bring it to the table. Different rural areas do have different issues, and it's good to actually go and see that area that they're talking about. And that is a plan that we've actually got.  And obviously, the people who live in those areas where those issues are will be invited to attend that meeting as well. When people think of a meeting in a council building, they think of it as a closed meeting. I know the meetings are open to the public, but the public don't generally attend.",

And we had our AGM recently, where we did have the privilege of having all three councillors, Claire St-Pierre, Bruce Thomas, and our Waikato representative, Councillor Noel Smith. Now, Koromatua is actually the very top end of Waipa, for those that don't know. And  we actually have a whole levy on all the rate payers, and they contribute to the council and the council reimburses that money. Now, the Wharewhare Community Hall is actually going to be built. And that means that we actually lose our Waikato councillor, Noel Smith, because the Waikato residents that are on the other side of the border, or Koromatoa Road,  are no longer going to contribute. So we lose a third of our income. So not only are we losing a third of our income, you're asking us with this proposal to only have one third of representation of councillors. Noel Smith goes because he goes with those people. You're asking us to only have one councillor  for Parongia. We have had issues at that hall and we have relied on both Bruce and Claire to assist us with those and point us in the right direction into helping with those issues that we've had. And it may just be a recommendation to actually talk to this person or I'll get that person to come back to you with it.  If you're asking that there only be one councillor, that one councillor in a rural area has a huge distance to cover, and how are they actually going to do it? I understand from other councils, including around New Zealand, which I can't talk of the South Island, but I can talk of the North Island, where these reviews have taken place, and yes, they have accepted  M\u0101ori wards, which is a fantastic thing to happen. But there hasn't been a loss in total of councillors. With Waip\u0101, you're asking that, well, not asking, there is going to be a M\u0101ori ward, but that's one extra councillor, but you're actually taking two councillors away.  One from Cambridge that was actually went in in the last, recently, so that's coming out. And then one from Pronghia to go. We have huge growth in the Pronghia Ward area.

So we're actually losing a councillor from Te Aumutu from Cambridge.  and from what is now going to be, or if the proposal is passed, now going to be the combined Kakapuku and Pirongia ward. So it's not exactly right that Pirongia is losing a councillor because Kakapuku-Pirongia combined is losing a councillor. It might be a bit of a fine point, but I just thought I'd make it.

So I think, Janet, what you're suggesting is that there'd probably be a rationalisation of which councillors would attend meetings like at Koramatua to just sort of spread, yeah. So, yeah, I just wanted to clarify that really, but I think it's just a logistics or a pragmatic approach to the large distances that would be needed to the councillors to go and meet at various communities and things like that.",

The AB technicians just walked in, so I've got that going on in the background. So that's all good. Yes, as Jackie said, I'm the Te Amuru branch chairman. So  sitting here with that hat on this morning. Before I start, I'd just like to thank Joe Greed. Joe came in and spoke to Te Mutu Whanau a couple of weeks ago, and that was just much appreciated. It really clarified a few things for our members, and it was well presented. So, I don't know if she's listening in, but just thanks for that, Joe. So, our submission is pretty straightforward, really, to be honest. It basically supports the proposal that council put up, that Joe put up anyway, just on reducing total council numbers.  We had some concern, I think, as Janet sort of pointed out initially, that, you know, it seemed to be reducing the rural wards and whatever. But once we sort of saw what she put up, that it seemed proportional and it wasn't unfairly affecting the rural wards. So we support less councils in total and which theoretically should reduce some costs, but it all seems to be a proportion to rural and urban. So we were in support of that.  And that was good. And also just like to sort of listening in this morning support what Sue and Ange have said just on the community boards and the strength of the community boards and the work that they do. And that probably lines up with the main part of our submission that we would we see that the Pirongi of the rural wards should mirror the councillors in that area. So two councillors in that area, two community board members and  elected so that we have that strong connection to community boards for, as they've pointed out, the strength and the value of that institution of what community boards do. So, yeah, we feel that that would be just a simple, less confusion about what's the community board committee and what's all that. People understand how they work well at the moment for the Kakapuka Ward and the Mangatatari Ward. So, just roll that out across the whole of council and just mirror the councillors.  So that's the guts of that submission there. Yeah, that's about it actually. So unless there's any questions.",

In my opinion, it is very important that the community board is truly independent and has the ability to challenge council on issues. Indeed, I recall reading an article a few years ago from former chair and current board member Gary Darbyshire,  where he stated that it was part of the community board's role to hold council accountable. This is the reason community boards are independent, having a committee structure, while sounds good in theory, has the key issue of not being independent and lacking teeth to take action. I, like many people, believe democracy is founded on checks and balances within the system. Without that check on power, we would end up without any ability for recourse.  For example, currently, it is still possible for the council to cease fluoridation. Fluoridation, for those that are unaware, is the addition of a hazardous waste product to the shared public water supply. Since the 90s, over 11 councils have used their democracy and taken the opportunity to end fluoridation. 11 councils took the opportunity to end fluoridation in the face of ridicule from the Ministry of Health. They stopped it despite the pressure they've received from the supposed experts.  I'm just going to interrupt you there.",

I'm here solely representing myself as an involved ratepayer, and I applaud the review, as it is of the Council, and appreciate the courage that it perhaps takes to go through this review. My personal preference is that  the community board in a similar manner. The current structure of both community boards and council, I think, was excellent for the 1980s and 1990s.  from then, but I just question with the changes in community, just how, if we may not be overrepresented both with community boards and council.  We are a relatively small population and we need to ask ourselves, what is the right size for elected representation? We also need to ask ourselves, what is the most appropriate structure going forward into the future? Is our current structure the right one?  and can we do that? Can we right size within government controls? I believe we are extremely well serviced with our various media and that is one of the most significant changes that we've had recently. So in addition  link, the Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Antelope. So we're extremely well serviced with all of those media.",
