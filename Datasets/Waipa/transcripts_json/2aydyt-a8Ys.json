And it's really valuable because it's all about, you know, what New Zealanders are doing. And the focus this year was really about the supply chain.  and how there's a new reporting framework coming out called the TCFD. I think it's the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures. And that's focused on the supply chain. And so all of those bigger corporates that are involved in that, they'll be looking at their portfolios and looking to reduce their emissions.  I will expect councils to be part of that group, actually, eventually. Yeah. But that could drive some really big changes. Yeah. And the other interesting thing was the emerging importance of biomass as an alternative way of generating electricity. Yeah. So which is going to mean forests become  much more important and seen as a source of energy for communities, really. And it doesn't have to be like the big logs or anything. It's more the scrap stuff, actually. Yeah, so that was quite interesting. And then the other thing I participated in was a climate action forum that was sort of facilitated by the regional council. And I think it was part of the Waikato plan, possibly. And again, it's just about, yeah, all those players within the Waikato,  and what their interests are. And it's a way for people to hook into stuff that is happening, sort of find allies and partners and yeah, yeah, like-minded people and yeah, get something, get some more going. I've been quite struck by the passion being shown by the younger people that are involved in that, like there's a school strike for climate change representation on there.  But generally, quite a broad range of stakeholders that are involved with that. So that's about me.",

But it actually seems that the Government is rewriting the Civil Defence Act, which it will present to us in a draft form on the 17th of January.

This is such an important infrastructure that I honestly think that we have to be well aware of it. And I've actually had some talks with other members and we will have to be aware of what they're asking us to do.

But anyway, there was the Zone 2 meeting a couple of months ago, and I've been to a couple of those now, and I really find them really beneficial, not only you building up a relationship with other fellow councillors and mayors and what have you,  CEs, but they're just really beneficial and you learn a lot from those. So I enjoy those opportunities. The Chamber had their employment webinar that Andrea Toiro hosted a few weeks ago. Another Chamber webinar was on hospitality and Jason Dawson presented on that. And we received his email yesterday of his new employment opportunity, which is great.  Also, morning tea with the Rest Haven residents yesterday. So I go around and see them every now and again and a few other rest homes around the place. I'm going to Bupa this week as well. St. Peter's School, the trust board have met with me a couple of times or have contacted me a couple of times with discussing potential bridge corridors on their land when that opportunity comes up.  Hopefully, that's not too far away, personally. The Carter's Flat webinar as well on the rezoning and then Perry Group, they contacted me a few weeks ago and did a presentation on their modular home project that they're looking at doing on Peak Road. And I think the housing  committee has seen that as well. And then lastly, the Ohaupo pedestrian crossing webinar, which Eric presented to some residents of Ohaupo and anyone else that wanted to listen to that webinar. So that's really, I mean, as we know, that's a really busy road, that incredibly busy road and going through one of our great little towns, villages or towns or whatever you'd like to call it.  settlements. So yeah, really, it's really exciting for them. So well done to them. Yep. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thanks, Phil. Was there any anyone else had anything?  OK, so look, from my perspective, I've been pretty heavily involved with what's now being called Communities for Local Democracy, and that's that grouping of, I think it might be 23 councils now, but definitely 22 in terms of the Three Waters reform, and obviously flow on concerns about the rapid changes, whether it be in  civil defence or housing intensification. We might as well not have bothered making a submission on the housing bill that came through and making submissions to the select committee. I think that's going to get pushed through regardless.  But I've got a meeting tomorrow in Wellington regarding the Three Waters, and the group has managed to arrange meetings with ACT and Greens and National, and we're still waiting for the Prime Minister to respond to the request to meet with her. So, I'm putting the case forward as we see it.  obviously change is necessary in certain parts of the country, but not one size fits all. And we've also got a meeting teed up with Castalia who critiqued  the earlier work done by DIA and were somewhat sceptical, I suppose, of the costing and the projected savings that were put forward. So we're looking to meet with them and also have a meeting tied up with Doug Martin, who's the chair of the DIA working party, that's to report back  to the DIA Minister Mahuta, I think around mid-February. And government has put up, as we all know, has paused the work on the Three Waters reform until that committee reports back to the Minister.  somewhat sceptical about the impact that they will have. It seems that they have already made up their minds. So we're fighting a rear guard action as it were, but I think it's still worthwhile pursuing points of view, looking to maintain ownership and control of those water assets. Obviously want to improve  water quality, drinking water quality and environmental outcomes, but not in the way that's being proposed. Claire, you've put your hand up.",

    "text": "A couple of comments there. Claire, I agree with your assessment, if in fact,  It is true that the decision was made months ago to mandate it. We need evidence of that before we start criticizing. It's certainly based on newspaper reports. You'd have to say that that's the case. And you would  wonder about the memorandum of understanding that local government entered into with the Department of Internal Affairs to act in good faith, if that is actually fact. So that needs to be determined. And Hazel, in terms of your comment,  One of the issues tomorrow is to actually launch the campaign, I suppose, from a publicity point of view. So we've all been\u2014all the mayors that are going down to Wellington have been asked to take their chains for a photo opportunity at Parliament. And so we will  kick that off tomorrow, and I can then send everybody out the draft consultation document. And the intention is to go as public as we can, put the facts out there as we see them, and try and debunk some of the myths, such as the number of people that are getting sick through drinking water throughout the country, just how bad the water supplies are. And when you look at them compared to  international standards, they feature really highly. So, there's a lot of myths out there, and we need to put the counter point of view. And I suppose councils were hamstrung to start with, because  government was saying we can't go out and consult with our public because we don't know what the proposition is. So everybody was sitting on their hands and expecting to still have the opt-out clause, and that was withdrawn effectively  a couple of weeks ago. So yes, look, it's ongoing. I still think it's worthwhile trying to pursue it. But as I say, at the moment, I suspect that it's going to be a fait accompli really, but we may be able to secure some changes.  The other issue that's been occupying me quite a bit during the month is the future proof hearings that we've had. And that was three days of hearings last week. And there's a significant push from developers around the major urban areas within the future proof.  three councils, I suppose, Hamilton City, Te Amuru and Cambridge, as far as we're concerned, and North and Pocono and Tikawhata and places like that, with really high demand for residential sections and massive areas of land being proposed to be turned into residential developments with  with, in my opinion, not too much forethought in terms of the whole community that's necessary when we build these communities. And going back to Claire's issues about climate change and trying to limit the carbon use, setting up  dormitory settlements away from work is not a wise move in the long term, because people have just got no option but to drive backwards and forwards to work because there's no or not significant public transport. So they're all issues that we'll need to debate, I suppose, in the new year. But certainly, there is a  and almost feeling like there's a gold rush to try and develop residential sections because of the price. So there'll be a lot of pressure there. So they're the main ones, and I've done a couple of videos for the Friends of Council instead of our normal Christmas do, which is a shame that we've had to cancel that, and a Christmas message for the council as well. So they'll be going out.  Well, the Friends of Council one has already gone out and the Christmas message will be just before Christmas 23rd or 24th. I'm not sure of the date. Gary might know, definitely. So that's probably the important points for my month.  let you know what happens in Wellington tomorrow and just what the feedback is on the three waters. So, if there was nothing else, we move to item six, which is the confirmation of the minutes meeting held on",

    "text": "Thank you. It's been a mixed year due to COVID-19.  Can everybody hear me? We've noticed, Sue. Yes, and Zoom meetings, while good under the circumstances, have not been ideal. The Cambridge Community Board looks forward to returning to regular meetings as restrictions are eased. In April this year, the Community Board was able to hold ANZAC services at the Town Hall, unlike last year. The two services were well attended, particularly the dawn service, although it was very cold and as there were a small number of people present,  that required some assistance due to the cold, we may need to give some thought as to how we prepare for next year's service. The services are organised by a joint committee of the Community Board and the Cambridge RSA. The RSA members are excellent at ensuring that correct military protocols are followed. We are also grateful to the Cambridge Brass Band for their attendance and musicianship.  Sadly this year it was the Armistice services that had to be cancelled, though wreaths were laid at the Cenotaph, the Memorial Park gates and the RSA section of the Hatapu Cemetery. On November 4th, wreaths were also laid on behalf of the RSA and the Cambridge Community Port and  board and its Lekinwa committee at the Lekinwa sculpture to mark the anniversary of the liberation of our sister city Lekinwa in France by the New Zealand Regiment in 1918. Messages were exchanged with Lekinwa on this occasion and also on Anzac Day. In December, our sister city in Japan, Pohoro, sent Christmas gifts to the members of our community board  including face masks, much appreciated, and photographs. Arrangements have been made to reciprocate these gifts this Christmas. This year, the New Zealand Sister Cities Conference was held at Te Papa in Wellington and attended by Graeme Webber, Alana Makai and myself. There was some good discussion on the value of these international links that were largely positive. The Sister Cities organisation has undergone a name change. It is now Global Cities.  On the local scene, the community board has been busy. This year, we have established pop-up community gardens. This is a project led by board member Elise Badger, and she has received good help from council staff as to locations of preparation. Currently, there are three neighborhood pop-up vegetable gardens. Two are on reserves in Leamington, and the newest is on a street verge in Cambridge. Each garden has local guardians keeping a watch on them  And these gardens are proving to be popular with residents who are able to source vegetables, herbs, and fruit from these gardens. There will be more as we find suitable sites. The board is grateful to the council reserves team for their assistance in this project.  Jo Colley Davies is our representative on the Cambridge Committee of Social Services, which is a particularly busy committee in this community. And she's been able to keep the board up to date with the work being done in the community for those needing welfare and other assistance. Currently, that particular committee is running its annual Christmas chair program, providing food, children's Christmas gifts, and other necessities for those facing hardship. Our little library,  The Empire Street phone box continues to be very popular. This year it got a new paint job, new shelving, and a mural to cover the back view of a shelf. We have a local resident who's willing to pay for another secondhand phone box. They're actually quite expensive, but they have offered. And we would like a suitable site in Leamington, please. Another of our connections with the community is our rural tour.  Over two Saturdays in May, our board members, Cambridge councillors, and two regional councillors undertook our rural tour. We met with communities at Whitehall, Temiro, Fencourt, Horohoro, Mangatatari, and Mauna Whale. Attendances by locals at these halls varied, but discussions were interesting. Horohoro Hall was undergoing renovations, and a month or so later, we were invited to their re-opening.  Temera Hall had had an upgrade last year in time for the anniversary of their neighbouring Temera Schools reunion. And it was great to see the renovations. Finkholt Hall is one of the closest to Cambridge. And one of the issues is they have a lot of through traffic despite not being a main road. But it's another well-kept hall that is the heart of its community. Kairangi Hall is not a council hall at all, but it's part of a settlement that began in the area many years ago.  and it serves a community that is very much a part of Waipa. The Kairangi people are concerned about the number of recreational cyclists that regularly pass through their district, but have no access to public toilets. So they tend to use one at the hall. So an interesting discussion was had as to how this could be remedied, because some of these cyclists are actually just using the roadside, not a good look. One suggestion was that a welcome to a Kairangi site  be placed on the roadside, welcome the cyclists and others, reminding them that the road was not the toilet or similar wording. I've also thought it would actually be quite good to have signs at quite close to local halls, just to welcome people to those particular districts like Horohoro, Mangatatari, Fencore, just so people know that there are little communities here.  At this hall at Kairangi, which has been maintained very well by the community, it was suggested that they could apply to the community board for funding for a project under our discretionary grants scheme. We visited the Mauna Vale Hall on the main road to Te Awamutu. There are a small number of residents in this area that care for the hall, but it seems that not many of the area's residents are involved. They tend to look through to Cambridge, I suspect, but it would be good to see some revitalization there.  The meeting at the Maungatatari Hall was very well attended, and there was a robust discussion on the community's opposition to the name given to the road leading to Waipoki Park, an indication that sometimes we all need to heed the words, he tangata, he tangata, he tangata. This year's community grants round was a good exercise for our board, as we learned a lot about many groups in our area that make a real difference to our community. However, we were not happy  that the decision should be made by way of a public meeting. This has not happened in previous years, and it certainly made us feel uncomfortable. We're happy to confirm a decision at a public open meeting, but it's the actual discussion of the  where the grant should go. It can be very difficult if someone knows something about an applicant that may be considered to be detrimental to their application, and they actually have to say this in a publicly observed meeting. It's not fair on the board or the applicant. The Cambridge Community Board has continued with its Cambridge Community Awards this year, and we were delighted to give one to our local photographer, Michael Jeans, who records much of everyday life in Cambridge.  as well as our special events. Michael, it was truly well deserving, as his photos are one of the most important records of our town. Christmas is almost with us, and due to COVID, various events have had to be cancelled. This included the Christmas parade, which the board had provided some sponsorship for. Along with some other organisations in the town, we worked with Destination Cambridge and the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce to provide a different Christmas programme.  which includes the shoe box floats, now displayed in many retail windows in the library, Christmas decorated letterboxes, so Santa could be sure to visit Cambridge as a first stop on the way from the North Pole. The community board also had a working bee to decorate some parts of the town with festive Christmas decorations, and they do look good. We are grateful to the sponsor of our Christmas lights program. We have a very big tree on Victoria Square covered in lights.  The sponsors are Waipou Networks, Better Electrical Cambridge, Grinters Funerals, Cambridge Lives and the Cambridge Cricket Club. It was good in the last week, too, to see the street banners supplied by Council added to our festive decorations. We look forward to 2022, hopefully without COVID.  and that we may once again enjoy life without restrictions and have a reduced number of Zoom meetings. Meetings around a table together does make for good discussion and good decisions for our community. Ng\u0101 mihi nui for the council's support for our board, particularly for the councillors, Graham and Alwyn, who sit on the board, our other Cambridge councillors, Roger, Mike, and Phil, and for the extra support we have from Deputy Mayor Liz.  The biggest thanks are to the members of the board, Joe, Elise, Alana, Jim, and also to our secretary, Karen. And thanks to Gary Knighton too, from the council staff who also attends our meetings. Thank you very much and Merry Christmas.",

    "text": "I just need to do a quick technical thing because all your beautiful pictures are right across where my words are, so I'll just scoot you across to the other side.  Alrighty. Morena, everyone, thank you for the opportunity to present the 2021 Te Aumuru Community Board Annual Report to you today. So, the year that's been. We started off with the Kiki Summer Stroll held in February in conjunction with an open day at the Police House and Temple Cottage. A big thank you to this group for their input and to Dee from the library for helping us promote the day.  It was a lovely day, enjoyed by those in attendance and enabled us to reconnect with the Kehekehe community. However, next year we hope to attend the ComSafe Community Day as that event actually attracted more people and will provide a better opportunity to connect with more locals. We also ran a successful greywater retention event. This was run by Jill Taylor earlier in the year, and it was to educate people about how to deal with their greywater. It was a great little event that we hope to run again,  The only hiccup was that no one knew council were running a similar event at the same time through the water education programme. So there was a little bit of a duplication there. Our e-waste, urban miners, through an introduction by Sally Fraser, we teed up the Te Aumutu Rotary to join forces with the Cambridge Rotary to bring urban miners to Te Aumutu to reduce our e-waste. This has been a great success with two trailer loads and on average $3,000 of recycling leaving every time.  Community Board is helping on the day and will provide some further financial support to ensure the ongoing success of this project. Project Battery, so that's a mock-up there. The recycling battery station, which has been a long time coming, but artwork is currently being printed and hopefully installed before Christmas at Pack'n'Save, if not just after. The DIY garage sale was planned to be run this year in conjunction with the Te Omutu Boxing Academy,  but it got skittled due to the lockdown. So we'll hopefully have another go at this next year. So I think we're on to third time lucky with that one. We got the rural tour back on. So for the first time in a long while, we had some really good conversations and got some great feedback. The communities, our rural communities were really grateful. We made the effort to go out and visit them and hear what they had to say.  And as a result of the tour, we've got involved with a number of things, but particularly the wattles on Kakapuku, so wattle pulling, which is helping with organizing volunteers to go to Kakapuku and help remove the brush wattles that have self-seeded and become a pest. This has had some setbacks due to COVID, but another pulling day is arranged for February the 12th, so we'd love to see you all there, so pop it on your calendar. It's also a very popular walking track, and with the numbers increasing due to  the Te Arawai app, we would also like to see an increased budget for the maintenance to ensure safety on the track and to minimise water damage to the maunga. In addition, we advocated for the Pollard Drive lights. So in September 2019, we had police come to us and discuss Operation Pekero, where police were implementing and identifying measures to minimise crime. An area that needed attention  was Pollard Drive as the lighting there was very poor. So we're delighted to see that there is now a plan in place and that work to rectify this will be undertaken in the next financial quarter. We've supported CCTV for Kihikihi for many years, having provided funding towards getting a camera out there. And at last, we're stoked to see that two cameras are going to be installed. We supported the Kihikihi residents and ratepayers with their plan for their LTP,  and the Police House Temple Cottage Committee to get funding for the annual administration costs from council. The Christmas street flags that are up now were funded by community board. And we also purchased the community board promotional flags as pictured there. However, if the representation review goes through, we've had a slight hiccup because we need to change it to Te Awamutu and Kihi Kihi. But never mind.  In addition, late last year, I had two full days in hearings defending Te Aumutu from yet another liquor store. A considerable amount of effort was spent on various submissions, particularly in relation to the Te Aumutu War Memorial Park, the long-term plan, and defending why we need a community board, which you did here. The other point of note is we are very sorry to lose board member Gary Derbyshire last month, and that the process to replace him is complicated, so community board  have chosen not to. That will be a real loss. Gary was an awesome board member. So hopefully everyone's gonna step up and they have some big boots to fill going forward. So going forward, boy races. So this was one of the things drawn to our attention during the rural tour, which we reported back and got the same response as the locals who were reporting incidents, that this is not a council matter,  but a police issue. So we've taken up the cause and worked alongside police and the locals to find there are in fact a number of things council can do and must do before someone is killed. The youth, Jill Taylor's been working on a programme for 2022. It'll be a free programme, three days a week and include lots of fun projects. Who are we, Te Awamutu? Working collectively with the Chamber, iwi and council to look at how community perceive Te Awamutu  from which we hope to recommend a brand that is supported by the people who live here. Street art. We want to get some local talent to liven up some blank walls around town, to reduce graffiti and create local pride. Our George Street car park. This has been on our radar for many years, like coming up nine. There have been some trees removed and cobbles laid through the center, which is great, but the safety aspects, including a safe walkway from McDonald's and crossings between the warehouse  and the toilet, which should be prioritised, had not been addressed. Interestingly, I was down there last Thursday, and to my surprise, the pedestrian crossing has been painted on the road. There's new directional signage and markings so you can see clearly and read what's there. The difference this made to the traffic was remarkable. It was slowing down, it was looking out for pedestrians, and stopping to let the kids cross the road. However,  No one told us this was happening, but it's great that it finally has. Issues and examples that need addressing. So I've run through these topics with Sue Milner, and by and large, she concurs. I could spend an hour on this, so it is very condensed and missing lots to fit into the 10 minutes or so we are allowed. I understand that the Finance and Corporate Committee have recommended a review of the community boards  with the intention to look at ways to improve how we work. So I want to take this opportunity to highlight some of our frustrations and that the parameters they set for the review include community board input. When we're informed of a project and how we're able to participate affects our ability to engage with the community, our contribution to the plan and the outcome. So for example, the annual plan, the long-term plan, we don't get to contribute to these plans. We do a submission like everyone else.  and despite speaking on behalf of the community, we are largely ignored. So things we know people care about never get a look in or take a very long time to progress like the George Street car park or new toilets for the stadium, even ones where people's lives are in danger like the Pollard Street lighting, where a young woman was actually raped in that dark street. The Memorial Park was another example, but due to a lack of time, I'm not going to elaborate now. So in our  thinking all plans for Te Aumutu, Kehekehi and Kakapuku should be coming to community board with enough time for us to engage with the respective communities, not almost at the end when we contribute a paragraph or two to a submission. Timeframes for seeking feedback for monthly decisions. The first we know of many items is in our monthly agenda. We have four days, including a weekend to canvas the community, so it generally does not happen.  This is not enough time and we often only have one perspective from which to make a decision. We need to know about what is planned for our area right from the get-go, along with the rationale to support or decline it. Credit, whenever we achieve anything, if it wasn't in my column in the paper, the public would hardly ever know about our involvement. We rarely get a press release about anything we do. We manage the discretionary funding, which is council money,  but community board decide who gets what, and we do the mahi. We don't have a link from our page on the website, despite asking for one. When the press release is done, all comments come from council staff, not community board, and there is barely a mention of our involvement. Then, because recipients think it is council, we get minimal acknowledgement. And I also would like to just quickly pop in there that I do support Sue in regard to the discussion around the funding of the discretionary fund,  It is really hard to do that in a completely public space, that discussion. Don't mind making the final decision, but it would be nice to go back to the way we used to and be able to do that on our own. In addition, the way we're presented is often negative. So two examples recently of this are the information presented in the community board versus committee workshop.  It included stats in that workshop slideshow that reflected community boards poorly. This was based on 69 people responding to a survey as supporting evidence for why we should do away with community boards. Or the press release regarding the resident survey prior to the representation review. Council services and facilities ranked high, reputation dips. Sorry, you did not dip, you crashed.  But we did not see only one out of five think council do a good job, quoted in the article. But we did see community boards singled out with the statement, two in five do not know what community boards do. This was actually 41%. So what about this almost 60% that do know what we do? Considering how much press there is for council compared to community boards, we are not doing too badly. And putting the statement the other way,  three in five do know what community board do would reflect that. Incidentally, I welcome the feedback and it shows we need to find a way to do better. Like the example I previously gave regarding George Street car park, we don't get told a lot of things. If we miss a press release, then we often have no idea. And it includes things like key staff changes. Debbie LaSalle, Charlotte Fitzpatrick is two recent examples of people who lived and we were never informed.  We're also told regularly that councillors don't know what we're doing. So why is this? Between the two boards, we have four councillors on our boards. Should they not be in time for them to raise community board members? From our side, they appear to support community board initiatives. Community board can be better utilised as a conduit between local community and council. And to do so, our input must be valued as meaningful feedback from our community  that we can be involved and given the time to do so, so that we can be taken seriously and we don't have to be a squeaky wheel for nearly nine years to get something our community has told us is important. So I'd like to finish by saying a big thank you to all council staff who do reports, attend our meetings and work behind the scenes to help us achieve our goals. A special thanks to Joe, Sally and Kieran  who do an amazing job in supporting the Te Aumutu Community Board with day-to-day business. A special mention for Sally Fraser, who is always so helpful and supportive with the e-waste projects. To councillors who support us and to you all for listening today, finally, last but not least, to the Te Aumutu Community Board members, Lou Brown, Susan O'Regan, Jill Taylor, Richard Hurrell, Kane Titchener, and the recently resigned Gary Durbyshire, for their tireless efforts to support  the Kakapuku and Te Awamutu communities. So wishing you all a Meri Kiri Himete, safe and happy holidays, along with a well-deserved break with family and friends. Kia ora.",

And the real big one is that we address our public places by law, in particular clause 29, which by giving it a bit more teeth, by adding specific places to the schedule, that will enable police to not just go and waive a wet bus ticket at the boy races, but to be actually able to impound cars.  which will hurt, and police believe that that would be the best course of action.",

So yesterday was the first day of our facilities, the library, museum, halls, et cetera, using vaccination passes, and that went well. A few grumbles from members of the public, but most were happy. The library's about to start a click and collect service,  for those that are vaccinated. They announced it yesterday and already have people that have put in orders. The COVID policy for mandating all staff to have the vaccine, consultation closed yesterday and a meeting is about to commence.  to look at the feedback and work through a recommendation to Gary. And Hazel, you'll be interested in this. The community librarians, we've set up a way where if someone can prove that they are double vaccinated through the little purple card, the community librarians will help them produce their  vaccine pass because we're aware that there are still members of the community that have been having difficulty in getting those. So we've put a little bit of an exception process in place so that can continue. Are there any questions or anything you want to add, Ken?",

And, yeah, Andrea, the Assistant Auditor-General was very complimentary in terms of the progress we've made, and indicated there were some areas, both in the report and verbally at the meeting,  Yeah, we could work for continuous improvement. So we've noted those matters and we'll progress those. But, yeah, I just thought that one was worthy of comment as well. Actually, the other one that is potentially worthy of comment as well is the KPMG internal audit report.  that we've given you the report and appendix for, that was into project management and governance.

And just to say what I'll do is in the Friday mail out, I'll give you a bit more detail about the recommendations of the select committee where it's got to currently. Okay, so going back to the report, the report is simply asking you to retrospectively approve a submission that was signed off by  Mayor Jim, on your behalf, using delegated authority. And this was done last month. As Mayor Jim mentioned earlier in the meeting, there's a whole wave of stuff that government are pushing through. And this is one of them that's come with no prior consultation, very little opportunity to even get a submission together. It was done a bit like a bullet train passing through, to be honest.  We managed to launch the submission last month on the 16th, and the hearings were on the 20th. We appeared before the Select Committee on the 23rd, so it was done at speed. The Select Committee made the report back to Parliament on the 3rd of December with their recommendations, and that's what I'll give you an update on. But just in summary, where they've landed in terms of hearing all the submitters and all the people who  either for it or against it or seeking amendments to it. And one of the things we had a very strong issue with is that it was talking about applying to cities, but here we were with two towns and it looked like we were in, but it wasn't clear. And they have clarified it. And what they've said is it's Hamilton, greater Hamilton, and  It includes us in terms of the way they've amended the definition. So it looks like we're definitely going to be in, that it will apply to us. And then just in terms of the actual standards, the medium density standards, they have made tweaks in response to submissions. They've also tidied up some of the linkages to other processes that need to happen.  that are required by the National Policy Statement for Urban Development. So there've been a number of kind of technical improvements that they've made. I'll go into that in more detail, but I'm happy to have any questions in the meantime.",

And it'll be through that plan change that we, through submission process, that we actually tie down where it applies, how it applies exactly.

Through the worship, through his worship, just as the council will understand, it's been quite fluid this year with the impacts that COVID's had on what both of these organisations have been allowed to do and also the effects on other areas in terms of Mystery Creek and the Cart Club, both picking up events that were originally scheduled to be in other places. So there have been quite a number of changes to this calendar prior to the one that's in front of you now.  And just carrying on with that theme, as you may have seen in the media in the last week or so, there's a plan to move the Soundsplash Festival, which has historically been held in Raglan, out to Mystery Creek for the weekend of the 21st to 23rd of January. So that's a change that's not in the calendar in front of you and hasn't been considered as part of the report. But if you have a look at the summary table on, I think it's page 159 of your agenda,  You'll see that adding those three days to the Mystery Creek events days or the day-night activity days still leaves Mystery Creek within the permitted number of events and even leaves some capacity for others. So the district plan does allow, even after the calendar is approved, for changes to be made.  provided we get 30 days notice and they're still complying with those overall requirements. So we're just working through now with Mr. Creek and the organisers of that event to review their noise management plan, special licences, et cetera, just to confirm that that's where they're going to sit. At this late stage, they don't sort of have much of a choice. They need to comply with these rules because there's very unlikely to be an ability to seek a resource consent for anything outside of those rules.  It's just one change to be aware of that will be processed in the next week or so. But otherwise, you're happy to take any questions if there are any.",

With the four-month report, so we're talking as at 31st of October.  The operating surplus was sitting at $36 million compared to a budget of $39.7 million. Our operating income was at 27% and the expenditure was at 30% of the full year forecast, which is just below the anticipated 33%.  The other thing I'd like to just point out is the capital expenditure was $212 million compared to a budget of $183.7 million.  And if you just go down to page 173 of that report, it shows you in the graph there, we've just got a bit in there that at the time of preparing this report, further forecast changes are being determined and will likely bring the forecast down to around 159 million. So that's,  the annual plan that's been worked on, which will impact this year's forecast. I'll take any questions around the four-month report now, if you like.",

Do you take that 0.58 over  is a 12-month average, or is it just over the period of the report? Because I'm sure that we've got really strong growth, and I thought it must be a 12-month average, because I would have thought it'd be much closer to the 2.93, and I'm just wondering how best to report it so that we've got an idea of the growth.

So, yeah, Councillor, it's where we're at currently, year to date, in terms of increased capital value for the district from new development and increasing rateable properties.  Now, there is quite significant lag factor in this. As you've observed, growth is quite rampant in the district. There is a lot of growth around us. In fact, you can see that actually when you look at the resource consents and some of the fees income in this very report. So certainly no shortage of growth.  However, before we can recognise that increase in capital value, we do need quotable value to actually put a value on those building improvements, etc. And sometimes there is a delay in them actually doing that work and us actually capturing it in our system.  So look, it's not unusual for us to be relatively low on the scale at this point of the year, but the crucial date is 30 June next year. That's when we have to have achieved the 2.93% to be certain of the additional rates income, and at this stage I'm still confident that that is very much achievable, despite the fact that we're currently showing just 0.58%.

I believe that there was an undertaking that any debt would be repaid as part of the asset transfer process. But look, I just suggest that it is too early days to really know the answer to that at this stage. However, the other thing that I would say is that in regard to the internal borrowing against any reserves,  Look, this Council does have relatively low debt. It has considerable ability to, you know, to actually borrow further. So, yes, look, it's not, I don't think it's of undue concern at this stage.  but obviously when the way becomes clearer in terms of what's going to happen in terms of water reform and what balances will be repaid, et cetera, that is something that we'll definitely be working through at the time.

They only pay rates on the land value.

Look, I guess it's, I mean, yeah, as you've acknowledged, that is based on the legislation, the legislative framework, yeah, but basically it requires Council to set its rates just once a year. We set the rates for the entire financial year, and then we bill those in four instalments, but the rates are actually set as of 1st of July, essentially.  Yeah, I mean, you know, potentially, yeah, potentially we could, yeah, we could, you know, take a remit through LGNZ, et cetera. Yeah, I guess I'd be a little bit dubious in terms of how successful that would be.

Yeah, so look, we try to get the LTP to be the best estimate possible, and we added an annual plan there, the annual plan to be the best estimate possible based on the information we've got. But look, it is difficult to get those budgets exactly right. Things do change, and particularly in the capital expenditure space. Yeah, thanks for that.",

Through you, Mr Mayor, and I'm not too sure if you'd be able to answer this because it will be the operators, but the operating expenditure on the two pools, not just the new Cambridge pool, it's not quite achieving the revenue, but their expenses, not only in the  October report, but in the November report as well, are showing to be quite ahead of the split budget that should be at this time. Is there any reason, and it's both both Te Awamotu and Cambridge pools, any reason that you know of that they're having a challenge on their expenditure levels?",

No, no, the target would be yes or no, you know, or fully compliant, you know, like, and they all got red marks against them, but I think something's gone wrong with the reporting system. And it's the same with the call-out times, which, you know, the target is 6,000, it's actually reported as 154 hours, which is also wrong.

So, yeah, so I am struggling to answer the question of why that's talking about four months. I mean, this is a four-month report. Whether we were sort of, you know, looking at compliance for, you know, on a month-by-month basis, and whether this is, you know, suggesting for the first two of those that we were compliant for three of the four months.  I'm not too sure, but yeah, but just bear in mind, my only observation here is just bear in mind that this is a new set of reporting measures that you may not have seen in the past before.",

But not a great deal of difference between those numbers.
