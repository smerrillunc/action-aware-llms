    "text": "Are you able to hear me? Yes. Yes, okay. Apparently there was a couple of questions that you wanted  answers to. I believe one of them was about the capitation fee that we pay.  I can answer that. As a District Rose Society, we are affiliated to the New Zealand Rose Society based in Palmerston North. Out of our subscription of $30 is a capitation fee of $25, which entitles our members to the Rose Cultural Handbook.  You see that? And the Rose Annual, which is quite a substantial book. You see that? And the Rose Review Book, which the New Zealand Rose Society  produce and any other rose information that is required. Plus it also entitles members to show their roses at district rose shows throughout New Zealand. The capitation fee has to be paid in advance based on the previous year's membership. It is payable in April  Therefore, we need to make sure we have enough funds in hand to cover this, as although the current membership is then due, it does not all come in on time.  From the $5 left out of the $30 subscription, we have to run our monthly meetings. Expenses from that include the room rental, gifts for our guest speakers, some raffles, and monthly newsletter, printing and postage costs, and supper. In December, we have a small Christmas function.  The quote provided to you for our proposed show is based on what we have received as quotes for items we need to purchase, hire and advertising and engraving of the trophies that we have to hand out. Plus there will be other expenses  as we are starting from scratch. Any assistance towards our first show as a new society would be much appreciated. Thank you for listening. Have you any questions?",

So I'm on the committee, I'm not a rose grower but all the ladies that are on the committee are except for me and I came on board to help with the marketing and promotion and I believe the same as the other ladies that Rosetown needs a rose show. The last rose show was in 2014.  been nothing since then, in 2015 it disbanded and the current members at that time, of which there are only a few, all closed down and when Diana returned to Te Amutu and decided we needed a Rose Show and a Rose Society,  her and the other ladies went around trying to find all the old collateral and unfortunately most of it has disappeared. Here's Diana now and if she can hear I'll let Diana take over. Okay so we've just got a couple of basically another minute to go Diana because we've pretty much used up your talking time so if you can just sort of add fairly concisely anything you would like to add to the conversation.",

The past Rose Society closed down in 2015 after 57 years. I felt it was so important to start up and have a Rose Society here in Te Aumutu.  as we are known worldwide as the Rose Town in New Zealand, and image we must hold on to. In 2020, the New Rose Society was reborn. So in all this year, we asked for your help with funding to help put on the 58th Rose Show. This will be the first Rose Show for the New Society after seven years without one for the public,  and visitors to be inspired by the rose and our town's image. The community funding would be a big help towards the costs involved to put on a good rose show. At this point in time, with our November rose show only a few weeks away, with COVID now in the Waikato, a committee decided we postponed the show until early 2020.  22, so to keep our members safe. It really is a day-by-day decision for everyone because of COVID. Thank you.",

And that was so we could provide our members, which at that stage we had 42.  41 now, but that was so we could provide them with the cultural handbooks, Rose Annual and Rose Review books, as I said before. But having to pay that money in advance all the time, we have to make sure we've got that amount to pay, because it's not always going to be $25. It could be more per member.  which adds up over time. So, yes, that's about it. I hope that's answered your question.",

And I think with the amount that you are requesting from us there, absolutely in full support. And I totally wish you all the best.

So thank you very, very much, Lynley, Lorraine and Diana, for taking the time to join us tonight and to clarify those couple of questions that we did have around that capitation question and just understanding how your finances worked a little bit better. That's awesome. And we do hope COVID, you know,  goes away basically so that you can get on and have your show, or at least that we're mostly vaccinated so that you can go ahead with your show. So I believe the sooner that happens, the sooner these lockdowns will come down and not bother us quite so much. So thank you very, very much and have a lovely evening. Thank you. You're very welcome to stay on for the meeting if you wish, but by the same token, we won't be offended if you do choose to leave.  So thanks again. Right, so now that takes us to pages nine to 15 for confirmation of the minutes. So if I can just have someone to move that the Te Aumutu Community Board confirm the minutes of the meeting held 14 September 2021 as circulated with the agenda as a true and correct record of proceedings. Have we got someone to move that for me? Gary, thank you. Richard to second. All in favour?  Any against? Thank you, carried. That now takes us to our quarterly report on pages 17 to 31. So I believe Martin's here, I spotted him. So welcome Martin. So we have Martin Mould, Manager of Water Services to speak to his report. Hopefully you've all read it so he can be saved a little time and just highlight some of the main points  But before we get you into that, we'll just move that we've received the Water Services Activity Report to the 31st of August, 2021 of Martin Mould, Manager of Water Services. So can I have someone to move that, please? Cain, thank you. Do you second?",

    "text": " Oh, good evening chair and committee members. So take the report as read and I'll just highlight a few things along the way. So of particular note is the flood hazard mapping. So if you recall, we sent out just under a thousand letters to properties were identified as like possible to flood in a one in 100 year event. And we've then done more surveying since then, and we're down to probably it'll be confirmation of less than a hundred houses  we'll actually flood in a 1 in 100 year event, and so they'll be the houses that have letters and notices on their limbs forming of that. We haven't sent those letters out yet due to COVID, etc. We've still got a few surveys to finish and we'll save those letters till we're back working normally.  We've currently got four reticulation staff who have had their training in backflow testing, and four more were due to go this month, but that's been cancelled for obvious reasons. We're continuing to work with the DIA and Water New Zealand on the transition programme for the proposed water reform, and all that work's been undertaken on a no regrets basis.  So we're working as what would transition look like, but no decisions have been made. So it's just a no regrets working basis. And last financial year, compliance was met for all the water treatment plants for both bacteria and protozoa. And we had not one zone non-compliance in the Pucrimi scheme, where the maximum level between sample days was exceeded. So we have to take samples on a schedule, supposed to be every three days.  Um, and, uh, scheduling was out by one day for one, one sample. So we were non-compliant for the year, which is fair enough. We deserve that. Um, and for this report in period starting, um, this financial year with two water treatment plants and non-compliant for bacteria, uh, with all plants compliant for protozoa. And I'll talk about that in a while. And the proof pickle removes zone again is non-compliant for July.  due to two positive E. coli samples within reticulation. We're still investigating that, but the evidence suggests that safe water was provided and it's likely to have been a cross-contamination event in the sample, as opposed to anything bad in the water schemes. And I'll flick onto our summer campaign. So for our summer campaign, you remember we have the four alert levels, one to four,  um, for water conservation, typically for the last 10 years, they've been based on a, on a. Capacity driven level. So when capacity reaches 70% of what we can achieve, we move through the alert levels until we finally get to alert level four. Um, obviously we've spent an awful lot of money over the last few years to improve our capacity. So we need to look at a different way of approaching this summer's campaign. So we're looking at it being, being more a educational.  campaign around water conservation rather than outright. When we've reached this trigger level, we'll go to it. So we'll still have alert water alert levels, but that hope there'll be more more educational basis than than than a formal campaign. We're still working on what that looks like. So hopefully we'll have that ready by one December.  And next is on section 5.4 where we had those non-compliances at the treatment plants. So again, when water leaves the treatment plants, it's required to, we had chlorine and that's required to have a contact time before it leaves the treatment plant of 30 minutes after it's been dosed. And on two different plants, we failed to show, to prove evidence that we'd complied with that 30 minutes.  in our first report to the district health board. So we're not currently non-compliant. We are looking at retrieving data from other sources other than the stuff we send directly online to confirm we did have that 30 minute contact time. So hopefully those non-compliances will be removed in due course. The parallel road water treatment plan, which is almost finished. It's currently being commissioned.  and we're currently sending water over to TMU2 from there. And we're just waiting for final sign off on that water being compliant, and then we can put it in service, which will be good. And the Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant, we're still working through the consent, and we're also starting, there's a list there of enabling works we'll be starting shortly.  to enable when construction does happen in a couple of years' time for that to happen smoothly. So there's a list of items there that we'll be working through. And then on stormwater hotspots, if you recall a while ago, we talked about rain gardens, which we're looking at installing on Lake Tukutu. We're almost ready to let a contract for that work to be undertaken. And we'll be putting in about 12 rain gardens around the roundabout by the White Church in Cambridge.  and down to the Queen Street roundabout. And again, we'll be looking at having a very strong educational program along with that to educate the community why we're doing rain gardens, how they work and what they're doing to protect the lake. So again, there should be a large educational campaign alongside that. Other than that, I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.",

    "text": "Good evening, Madam Chair and committee members.  We'll take Gina's report largely as read, but we'll quickly provide an overview of the skate park project at Centennial Park, which you may know a little bit about already, but we'll try to fill in any gaps. So during the 2021 to 31 LTP,  consultation, there was some really clear direction from the community that they wanted to have current skate park facilities replaced in Cambridge and Te Amutu, and also from the Kiki and Porongio communities that they would like to see skate facilities as well.  So following the LTP deliberations, all four skate parks were included with some budget with an objective to have each location provide a point of difference for the skate park users and domestic tourists. For this project, we've got our project delivery team will be driving the procurement and project management. And Gina Scott, who is our community advisor, who you'll hear from in a minute, she's going to be driving our stakeholder engagement  And I'll be sifting around in the background providing direction and support as I can. The Te Amaru site, which is at Centennial Park,  We're looking to have that as the first cap off the rank. The reason being that we'll try and tie that with the parkour facility and the play equipment installation, which we've previously spoken to you about, which is already well in advanced planning stages. It's all going well with procurement of a contractor. We'll commence that in Centennial Park in May.  As I touched on earlier with the skate park installation, we're looking to include that into a contract which will go across four years and be inclusive of a play provision contract. So we're looking to get an expression of interest out to contractors this week. We've got some very clear criteria that need to be met to ensure that we get a quality contractor. So I'm pretty confident we'll get that.  When I presented to you last year with Reg McFall, he spoke of his eagerness to get a bike schools track up and running at Centennial Park as well. Gina spoke with Regan earlier this week just to see how he's placed and track him with that. And he's still really motivated to deliver and upgrade that bike schools park. But in the current climate with COVID, he's having a bit of trouble with access to the contractors and fundraising.  And also focus on focus on his own business as well at the moment. So he's just probably pushing pause on that. Well, until we get to a bit of a new normal in our COVID sense, as Madam Chair touched on earlier, vaccinations seem to be the way to be going with that.  However, he is quite interested to still be involved in the projects, and he's really keen to be part of our, what we're calling, kaitake group for skate parks. And to explain a bit more on that, I'll hand over to Gina, who's going to be helping deliver that aspect of it.",

    "text": " Kia ora koutou, thanks for having us. So yeah, just I guess carrying on, we are going to create a kaitiaki group for each of the skate parks to help us through this process. And the intention of that is to  get the users of our parks, and predominantly youth, but obviously we have a wide range of aged users of these parks, to take some ownership and help support and keep these places safe and well looked after.  So I've made some contact with some of the kids or youth that presented to the LTP, to councillors as part of the LTP submission process, and everybody I've spoken to has been really keen to get involved. So we're giving them the opportunity, obviously, to be feeding back into the draft plan, which we have at the moment, coming shortly. We're going to run some sessions  at the skate parks, which they will be involved in. And it's also an opportunity for us to, you know, I want to say use, which is not ideal, but to use them to share our advertising across their social media platforms and, you know, which we don't have access typically through our council comms approach.  So yeah, we're leading sort of a three pronged engagement through this whole process. So the first step being we're going to, you know, go out with our draft and get as much information as we can and feedback from the communities that are using these parks and then, you know, be able to hopefully design then a place where these kids or youth and skate park users, where they want to be, that caters for all of their needs, not just now, but sort of moving into the future.  And once we get our first phase of feedback that will go back to the designer, he will then and you know try and incorporate what he can where he can enter the design will go back to our community again ask them for feedback on that.  And then, you know, and a third time. So hopefully, you know, for the third time, we've come up with a really cool design, creating a space where everybody's really happy that caters for skaters of, you know, high level, not so high level scooter users and anyone else in between. So we're hoping to really be able to create something that caters for everybody.  Yeah. So, cause at the moment, I guess, I'm not sure you may know this, but you know, a lot of our skaters are leaving town to go and skate at parks where they have, you know, access to beta skate parks, to different kinds of jumps and whatever that lingo might be. Cause I'm not a skater, but, um, yeah, so that they are leaving our community and, you know, we don't want that. We want them to be a part of, you know, be a part of a community for as long and as much as we can.  So yeah, look, it's pretty exciting. And like I said, everybody that I've spoken to is just so keen to be involved and really, really excited to, yeah, just to be part of the process and to see that this is happening. I guess just a couple of things I will touch on. It's just the date. So the dates have actually been changed. So in the report, we recorded the dates as being,  the 23rd of October, which is still right. And then we had, oh my gosh, I've scribbled on my piece of paper and I can't actually see what it was originally, but now it's the 27th of October. We are aware that this is close to Labour weekend, but in saying that it was an opportunity for us to get our designer on site. And so he would then to be able to,  you know, feedback to our community and answer any questions that we can't, because typically none of us in the project team are, you know, skate experts. I would really love, you know, some support from the community board if anyone's got some time to be there and to come along and be a part of that process. You're more than welcome. I'd love to see you there. So, yeah, that's pretty much me.",

We took that back to the project team this week and last week, and we sort of fleshed it a bit more, and we felt that it could undermine the integrity of the engagement.  We're not trying to just create numbers to these events or to this engagement. We want to actually get the users that are actually going to be using the skate park for the future to be providing us the direction and the feedback that they want. So we, in saying that we are looking at  providing a skateboard giveaway across the four different communities, just so we actually get that targeted incentivization or draw card to bring some of those crowds in. The ones that we know will draw us to the right feedback that we can take away to have a really informed concept design and successful skate park.  So that's the end of our k\u014drere tonight, but is there any questions or feedback you would like?",

There was sort of some to-ing and fro-ing there about venues and whether we, you know, what locality they had. And the other one was with Regan MacFall. Will that pump trap be compromised with this design or are we going to still have a pump trap? Because I think there's a place for that as well in this design.

The concept design that we had refreshed in the last year provides space for the pump track, the skate park, parkour facility and some play elements as well. So plenty of space to continue doing that. And we haven't encroached on that space at all with what we're doing now.  The first question on Te Paparoa, we've had an early k\u014drero with them just to see how far they've progressed their discussions and things like that. You're right, the venue is still something we need to sort out with both Kihiki and Porongia. So we'll be working with the team in the next week or two internally first just to find some sites that potentially could have some value.  We'll then undertake that to our mana whenua partners, just to see how those sites potentially stack up for them and the pros and cons for them. And then we'll take that to each of the Kiki and Porongia communities, which obviously includes Te Paparoa. They're very, very excited. They have got a good base of people really keen to see that go off the ground. So they'll be our eyes and ears out in the community for us there.",

Bridgestone. So he kind of lives down there and he's really, really passionate. So he's involved, but yeah, look, I'm happy as if, you know, you think that the crew at CBR, you know, can add some light to that. I'm happy as to contact them.

Something that I've learned in my previous experience with skateparks is that they've all got different ideas and they're never gonna quite happy with it unless it's their idea. So it's gonna be quite hard to sort of play that out, but that's where we are bringing in the designer along with us to those engagement sessions so that he can speak to the users exactly. So, you know, we've designed this preliminary design. It's based on the site location, the site terrain and the geography.  and also the budget that we've got for it. So he'll be able to sort of provide that, and then as they give ideas, he can say, yep, that could work here, or no, that won't work here, and what's going to come out, what's going to come in. So have that really interactive discussion with them.  In terms of the design, we've had the concept refreshed in the last year. So that was for the whole park and that sort of allocated spaces. Now we're getting more into the detail of exactly what's gonna be on site on the skate park part of it. Okay, thank you. All right, so the cost, that cost is all inclusive. As part of the LTP last year, there was $120,000 for year one for these investigations with the community and the design.",

But thank you very much. So if we haven't got any other questions, thank you very much. Great report, really looking forward to seeing this rollout, as I've already said, and thanks so much.  for giving up your time to come and speak to your report tonight, both Brad and Gina. So thanks heaps, guys, and good luck with this project. Awesome, thank you. Thank you. Right, so now we get to pages 35 to 44, and we have a notice of motion from Cain Titchener.  Cain, how about before we move anything that we just hand over to you and maybe you can speak to, you know, like where you're coming from, give us a little bit more background if you have in regard to why Timaru chose to not go with local government New Zealand, just so we've got a little bit more clarity around that would be really great.",

So so my view on this whole three waters thing is that if the council does not take a really, really hard line on this and actually take some really firm action, that we're going to get three waters. Right. So that's that's my view of it. And this is what's happened with other issues around water.  and because Council doesn't seem to want to put up any sort of fight or  actually push back in a really firm way, this is we're just going to get three waters. So my view on this is I just came across Timaru District Council voted to leave the Local Government New Zealand basically because Local Government New Zealand was a mouthpiece for the DIA in terms of just pushing this through. And I've seen this in other areas too with Local Government New Zealand. Stuart Crosby said that  He was the mayor of Tauranga for, I think it was 12 years, I'm guessing with that, but I think so. And over that period of time, he had a referendum on fluoridation twice, and the community said no twice. And then he finally said when they've got this mandate to come through, that's coming through shortly, that we finally got the answer that we're looking for.  So this is the thinking out of local government New Zealand. And what I'm saying is that all this is is a recommendation to council. Council can take it or leave it. My view is that council won't do anything with it because they're sort of yellow bellies, but that's fine. It's another story. But I think this is something that we need to actually push forward as part of the community speaking up on it. And I just, yeah, that's basically it.",

We have sent a very, I thought, a very good submission to the DOA and to the government.  We have our mayor sitting, unfortunately, on zone two representative to the LNG jet, but I do think that we've got to remain on that body. The simple fact of life here is that if we remove ourselves and do what Timaru did, we lose the ability to have communication. We, as a local council or as a Waipa District Council, would have a very minuscule role in the statements to the government.  But if we stay within LNGJ, we will have at least a collective role. We're finding at the moment, and Mayor Jim has stated that quite a number of councils are actually in the same position we are. We are not happy with the recommendation. We'll say that straight up and down. You were sitting listening to what we all said and what Mayor Jim said on Monday, last Monday. So we are not happy with the current time. We are worried that we will lose  our assets, and we do not have the representation with it. So we've put that in our submission, which follows, I'd say, in your appendices. And I think if you've all read that, you would see that that is what we are trying to get across to DIA. The problem I have is that if we pass this, you'll actually find that all it will do is allow us to have this interaction between council and community board of negativity  and I don't think that's going to be great for anyone, because the media will jump in on it. And I will say strongly that I think what the councillors are trying to do at this stage is remain connected, to remain positive, but we are objecting to what is being implemented against us. So I'll leave it at that.",

I think we've been pretty direct about our collective disapproval of the reform, and we have to remember that LGNZ is an industry body, and as much as the Three Waters reform is a really big issue, there are other issues at play, and it's better that we be associated with our industry body to  to lobby and be involved in the other issues as well. So it's not just the one issue driving the whole ship, so to speak. And as much as I think I'll go out on a limb and say that there was a fair amount of discomfort with LGNZ's position at times around the memorandum of understanding and connection with these three waters reform, I think it would be really knee-jerk and extreme to  withdraw our involvement with the industry body, because there's a much bigger, you know, broader, wide, a broader scheme of reform and play here. I understand your frustration, though. We share it too, Cain, but I just think that there are bigger issues at play than that one issue. But I agree with what Lou said.",

When I looked at or was made aware of Timaru's situation there, my immediate reaction was, what a knee-jerk reaction this is down there. I don't think these guys have looked at the big picture. And in terms of representation, we need representation here. We need a common body, which gives us strength in numbers. The moment we start stepping out on our own, we become a lone voice.  It's certainly aligned with Timaru, but in terms of effectiveness with what we're trying to achieve, I don't think it's going to fly.

But definitely, if there's a better way of doing it further down the track. But I think that we need to give council a bit of a go on this because they have written a really good submission. And so my preference would be just to sit tight for a little bit. And if we need to revisit it a little bit later in the year or early next year, let's definitely bring it back up again. And thank you for the opportunity to just talk about this again and  air our views around this Three Waters stuff, because it is very, very important. So we'll leave that motion off for this evening.

Oh, but just quickly before we do move that, if this goes through, Arrowater Street Car Park is the preferred option of a suggestion. We're okay with that, cool. So as is, Richard, would you like to move that seeing as it's your motion?  Yeah, Richard, someone to second that, please, Lou. OK, so all in favour of calling it the Arawata Street car park. Lou, yeah. OK, against. So we've got Gary. OK, so, well, that means we've we've got us, sorry, that will be carried. So  Officially, we are now calling the Bunnings car park, the Arrowater Street car park, or at least we're making a recommendation to council to call it that. My final comment on it is it is going to be a hard sell because I think like Gary points out, people will refer to it as they do. However, I suppose, you know, recommendation to council to encourage them in their comms to be calling it something different is at least starting the ball rolling.  to us thinking of it as something other than Bunnings. So we'll see how successful this is. Right, so I just need to, sorry, bear with me, just jump onto a second computer to move my run sheet up. So we now move to pages 47 to 49, which is our treasury report. So we'll take that as read.  So, if we have someone to move that for me, please. Gary, seconder? Richard, thank you. All in favour? Aye. Against? Carried.

So if we haven't got any further comments in regard to the discretionary grant, sorry, our financial report, we'll move along to the discretionary funds. And we've got the Te Aumutu Rose Society incorporated again back on our agenda and also Rotary. So for the Christmas parade. So let me just jump to the right page.  We've actually got Rotary up first, even though my run sheet's the other way around. So Rotary are once again wanting funds for our Christmas parade. This year, I believe they were asking for $6,000 to go towards the running of their event. So comments in regard to that application, please. Gary, start the ball rolling.",

And I think, I guess the first thing is that, look, we need to support the organisation Rotary because this is our flagship event, which we support. And I think that they are deserving of support from us financially. The other interesting thing that I saw in that report was that in terms of sponsorship and calling the event what it is,  I was interested to see that Core Steel, who are one of their major sponsors there, are actually providing less or have provided less by way of financial input than what we did last year. And we have this situation arising again of recognition for the financial support which we give this particular event. And I certainly would like to support them, but I certainly would like to insist on that recognition again.  which we often deserve, but it's not received. Thanks, Gary. Other comments from the rest of the board in regard to this application? Cain, then Richard. Yeah, I spoke to Chris Kaye. He said that he would like to see more funding for this project. He said that he would like to see more funding for this project.",

But he did say that with the interest rates so low, that, you know, could be, you know, better use change of strategy there. So, I think we should be giving to them, I think, a similar amount to last year is probably adequate. And I agree with Gary that to get some more bit more recognition would be would be good. I talked about level  what level would they be running at? And he said at level one, they're only gonna run at level one. So I wonder if we have a bit of a condition on our fundraise funding. If it doesn't go ahead, that we get it back or, you know, just to see where we're at with it.",

We actually, when I was working in Norwood, supplied prizes for that particular parade quite regularly and got involved with it.  The other thing I looked at too was advertising. And surely this is a community thing that we could use the council advertising regime or the public, the media team to actually do that for us a little. They could probably relieve that cost quite a lot. So I'm in agreement with Cain. Well, that's good, well done Cain. And say that, yeah, no, the 3000 is probably about my limit.",

Shane's got a branding background. I've had a brief discussion with the Te Awamutu chamber and  they are definitely interested. I've had a little chat with Bill Harris from Maniapoto and, oh sorry, Ngati Apakura, I should say.

And I think we acknowledged as much as I support the Rose Society being revamped,  in the interim, and I think that deserves our support. Thank you for that. I believe that we are more than just the Rose Town. The Rose Society, I think, was instigated sometime in the 60s by a couple of key people in town, which is fine. But prior to that, we have a massive history. There's a massive historical significance, which makes Te Amute quite unique, much along the lines of the frontier town, that sort of thing there, which is going to tie in with Te Arawai.  And I think that that discussion and the conversation that we had there back in the day is still very, very relevant. So I'd certainly be very supportive of canvassing the views and engaging the community to give us their thoughts on using all the media that we can so that we get a very, very clear picture as to where we're going here. I'm also aware that we have some very strong traditionalists who will be supporting the Rosetown concept for quite some time, who have businesses involved,  long established businesses as well that rely on that identity.

But during that discussion Shane has just got a little idea that was around marrying the roses with the heritage and he had some quite neat ideas and there might potentially be  something even in that space that could come from this, that there is the possibility of marrying the roses as being the European influence here, and then having more of a historical, cultural, te ao M\u0101ori view and, what's the word I want, identity involved with that. And just as a quick idea, one of the things that I, you know, that was that we had this  potentially beautiful poe that could be situated leading down to Te Arawai, but it could be decorated around the base with bright red roses that represent the blood that fell in our area back during the land wars. So you could tie in significance that way. But that's getting a little bit of a head because as I say, we really want to focus on what the community  comes up with as a starting place. So yeah, if I was able to move a recommendation, I have got something prepared, which I've gone and mismothered, that would be right.",

    "text": "Can I just make a wee comment? So for those of us who've sat on this long enough,  We know that this has sort of been an exercise or an issue that's been rolling around for some time, and unfortunately it has been, well not unfortunately, quite obviously it's been linked to the emergence, the creation of Te Arawai, and linked to the importance in terms of our local history. Unfortunately, for whatever reasons, Te Arawai hasn't emerged in the timeframes that we were hoping it could have been.  But I kind of don't want to go rehashing stuff that we actually already know. I mean, there was a lot of work done by this board some years ago. You remember it, Ange? And Richard. So I kind of don't want to necessarily rehash that. So I wonder if there's an exercise to be done. It's kind of pulling it, pulling together the work that's been done previously  And then maybe we can take restock again as a community board, pull all of that information together, because there are members around our community board now who weren't, and probably staff too, to an extent, who aren't particularly across all of that historical work. And then maybe we make a decision about how we go forward as a board.  Yeah, it's a frustrating one, and it's something that I've always been really annoyed about, particularly the entrances to the town, and for want of a better word, the branding of the town. But I just sort of don't think it's appropriate to go off a half-cott and think, oh, this is a great idea, let's go down this avenue. I think there's been a lot of work done. Historically, a lot of people have invested in the process, and I think as much as we're sort of in a bit of a pause right now, I think it might just pay to  pull together all of the information that we've currently done, the work that's been done around it, and then make a more of a strategic, or have some discussions and make a strategic plan going forward about how we then put that into play in the absence of perhaps Te Arawa coming or in the knowledge that Te Arawa is coming.",

And so, yeah, I definitely believe from that initial discussion that that is very much  needs to be a part of it as does you know involvement with iwi as well so you know I think that we can take on board and incorporate you know what you're speaking of Susan and with finding out just getting a good feeling for the community and the suggestion was to use one of the Waikato University students to actually do that part of it so that we could  you know, get a really good, relevant, current feeling from the community as one part, and then bring in that information like what you're suggesting to, you know, to put the whole project together.

And then the details of the discussion and the work that had been done starts to tail off and becomes forgotten.  I look, I think, Susan, in terms of a strategic direction has talked a lot of sense. So, and more I think about it, the more information that we had come together and I now start to remember the work that had gone into it and some of the graphics that were put together and there was a massive amount of stuff.

So what we're currently doing with Te Arawai at the moment is just resetting that project, reconnecting with the new site that we have, and then works will start to commence on that project. So just wanted to give you an update on timing for Te Arawai, but I think it's also really important to note that at the moment,  Unfortunately, and I have heard just for my short time on the community board and supporting you, the frustrations around those entries, around that identity within Te Aumutu.

I've got another lady who's very keen to get involved as well.  that if we could create a little working group to start ticking away at it, then maybe we can have some of the, you know, we can take our time to do the preliminary work, get that happening, pull in that historical information, and then we might be ready to have a little plan or some recommendations to put forward to council to then work on. But, you know, for what we're proposing at the moment, I don't see there being a huge  request for any substantial funding at this point. So on that, I would like to recommend that the Te Aumutu Community Board creates a working group to engage community, to get a clear indication of what the identity of Te Aumutu is from a community perspective, and to include the historical data with the goal to create an agreed brand for the future.

I don't feel that that's, I think that the community board has always been, perhaps not so much of recent times, but it's always been really keen to try and push this  whole branding and identity issue, but it was paused on account of Te Arawai. It became so much of an integral part of the development of Te Arawai that we felt we needed to sit and wait and we were comfortable with it. Because it's drifted sort of indefinitely for us, I understand the need now to perhaps revisit it. Are we going to be linked to that development?  or are we going to branch out and try and push our own barrows, so to speak, bearing in mind that, as Sally said, that we have those budgeting constraints. But I guess my point was that, oh, shit, just lost it. Excuse my swearing. July 2017 was when we did our, and I had it on my phone here, we did the workshop, that comprehensive workshop with the comms team working out  what was important to us. So that's July 2017. And my point, I guess my question to you, Ange, was less about throwing the whole thing, you know, put on the shelf, we're not interested. We're very, I think we're interested in ascertaining who we are and pushing that in terms of making it relevant to what we see around our town. But I think what we found as being a descriptor of what we were as a town, we've done that work and I don't want to, not so much waste,  these very eager people's time doing something that's already been done. Let's channel the energy into setting a roadmap to fulfill it rather than getting them just to rehash the stuff we already know. And don't for a minute see it as trying to dampen their enthusiasm or crush your idea that you're bringing it towards us. This is very, very relevant and very pertinent. This is what the community board should be and is about.  but it's about not wasting people's time as well. And I think we have quite a lot of stuff on there.

And we sit down with them and I'm more than happy to be on that working group to go over what has been worked on prior to the Walsh's involvement in this issue.  And then that working group can report back to the community board about what sort of, whether a summary, if you like, of where we're at. And then perhaps seeking direction of how the community board would like that working group to go forward with the issue. Bearing in mind, of course, as Sally said, we don't have a budget for it.",

And then the other one, I just wanted to say thank you to the staff  for getting straight back to us in regard to that query for Angela Brown from the secretary of the Kihikihi Police House in Temple Cottage to be heard at that SPMP meeting. They provided a very comprehensive response to that. So thank you very much. Do I, hold on, sorry, I'm on the wrong page. I just need to double check that. No, that's right.  I did just want to make one further comment, and it's, I don't so much think that the problem here is, is so much that, I'm just trying to think the right way to word this, that this is technically correct that, you know, the response that we've received, the engagement with those groups of people,  But I think it comes down to the fact that they still really don't feel like they were heard. And I have one additional question in relation to that, and that is, this group came back and said that they wanted more time. Could the meeting be delayed so that they could provide their input to that SPMP meeting? They were told, no, it couldn't.  But that tower has been in that report since 2013, and it sat there and sat there and sat there. And then when it's come up, it's had to be boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Like even we got the report in our community board meeting last month, and we had no time to go and talk to the community before we had to make a decision. Then this group asked for a bit more time  but no, it had to go to SPMP. Could, and I'm just using this as an example, and I'm just raising it as, you know, where I'm thinking, is that would it have harmed anybody or anything to have delayed it, let them have their town meeting, let them bring their information and discussion so they could have presented in a deputation, to have put it off till November?  and then have had done the Te Rata Reserve discussion then. I'm thinking that this is some of the reason that we're getting these negative responses from our community because we are engaging, but are we listening? Are we meeting their needs? That's my only other part of my comment, but thank you very, very much to the staff because they did get back to me very, very promptly  to get that in, and I really appreciated that. So thank you. But did anyone else have any comments around that at all? No. OK. Oh, Gary, sorry.",

I had a bit of a giggle the other day when the brass band approached me and said, look, given that the community has ratted around and upgraded the band rotunda in Victoria Park to a high standard, what they had decided that they would like to do is to have a couple of little plays on Sundays coming up there, depending on the level of COVID that we're at the time.  and asked how do they go about just making sure there's nobody else using the band rotunda. It is a band rotunda and we only have the one band in town. So given what has happened in the past, I've played at that rotunda several times. So we approached Sally who put us on to another staff member there in terms of getting an application done. It really, really surprised me and the band committee having a bit of a giggle over it. Just the lengths that the band has to go to just to have a little bit of a play out on a Sunday afternoon  to have somebody sitting down on blankets, a million dollars worth of public liability cover. And then because they're not selling tickets or anything like that, people can come and go as they like. Depending on how much traffic is there, they may have to forward a traffic management plan just so that they can have a play out on a Sunday afternoon in the band rotunda. So, you know, they will go down and they'll go down that track, they put the boots and they'll probably get some, have a chat with the tennis club about some access to toilets and things like that.  It's really interesting just how far we've come since I was playing in the band and just how many rules and regulations that we have to now jump through so that people can sit down and be part of a community and enjoy some music put on by a bunch of volunteers. But yeah, we shook our heads, had a bit of a giggle over it, but it was quite interesting just what has happened over the past 30 to 40 years, Madam Chair.",

They felt very strongly that we needed just something on to cheer us up in the midst of all the COVID things that are going on. And yeah, they ran a really good little event. And, you know, if it wasn't for COVID, I think we would have seen a lot more people down there and it had a really nice feel to it. They got a great day. And certainly all the people that were involved, you know, were very pleased to be there and keen to go again. So hopefully we'll have our flags  and then we might be able to go too, rather than looking like Nigel No Mate's just sitting at a table.
