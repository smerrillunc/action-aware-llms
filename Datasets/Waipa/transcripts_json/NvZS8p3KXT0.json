We get a bit lonely the rest of the time. I'm not sure if it's the Zoom platform that scares people away or us. But thanks, Leslie and Sally, for getting along, and Ryan, who I've got sitting here beside me. Make sure he behaves.  So first up, we've got some apologies. So looking around, we've got Richard. No, we've got everyone here, so we won't have any apologies. Disclosure of members' interests. Now, you would have all received a email from Joe just outlining the situation with the urban miners recommendation. So does anyone want to  feel that they need to declare a conflict of interest there. Lou, you work with Chris.",

So the recommendation is that  is in front of us is that item nine, the notice of motion to follow on from the public forum and item 11, the Waipa District Council facilities operation under the COVID-19 protection framework is to move before item 10. So if we're all happy with that, can I get someone to move that confirmation of order change?  and I'm happy to second it. Okay, all in favour? Aye. Against? Carried. Okay, so we'll have that new order there, which will enable our visitors to be able to stay on for the discussion on this boy racer issue that we've got. So now we move to item five, which is the public forum.  what I've decided that this is a really, really important issue that I want to make sure that you are all heard. So I just need to remind the public forum participants that you have five minutes each to put your point across. So Leslie and Sally, were you wanting to do yours together or do five minutes each? Together, yeah, we'll do it together. Okay, all right, well, you guys are up first.  Welcome to tonight's meeting, and we're all ears.

    "text": "Yeah, well, I guess we're here out of fear, and that is fear that somebody will be killed because of the behavior of these young people.  nearly all had near misses with them on the road. Our family members, my son, Sally's stepdaughter, have all had near misses and had to drive through huge crowds of young people. 50 plus cars parked at the intersection between Arapuni Road and Rotonata Road. So we're also very concerned about the destruction of our reserves.  skidding cars and vandalism of the amenities and also road signage being knocked over all over the place and there's a must be a huge cost to the ratepayer there to repair all that damage. Our local intersections are covered in black tyre rubber and some are so badly damaged that the road markings are completely obliterated.  Vast quantities of litter are being left behind at these intersections and on our reserves. Alcohol containers, drug-taking paraphernalia and general rubbish. And we're very concerned about the threatening behaviour of these people when they're confronted by us, the residents, by Comsafe or the police. And moving on to the police,  which has already been raised by the mayor, I know, is the inability of police to respond in a timely manner because we're in a rural location and the police just do not seem to be adequately resourced to deal with this issue promptly. So, the things we're requesting, on our own road here at Arapuni Lake Road, we're requesting that the speed limit be reduced from 100 kilometres an hour to 50 kilometres an hour.  And there's shortly going to be nine houses here within a very short distance of each other and obviously nine driveways. People zooming past at 100 kilometers an hour with boats. You know, and it's just not safe to walk down our own road, especially at the weekend.  We'd like some lockable, vandal-proof gates on Bulmer and Arapuni landings to prevent the gathering of these youths at night. I notice in Cambridge, on the mighty River Domain, beside Lake Carapiro, they've got some very spectacular gates and ramps, speed humps, to stop people entering at night.  more than happy to take responsibility for locking and unlocking those gates at agreed times. We like CCTV cameras so we can record number plates of people coming down to the landings because quite often the people that come down here in the evenings do the burnouts and skids on the way out. So it's helpful to have those number plates before they start.  calming measures at the intersection of Arapuni, Rotorata and Bulmer roads and these need to be the type of the raised medium type. This is so that they can't be removed by these vandals because they will remove them if it's possible to remove them. I'll hand over to Sally and she can tell you what we've already done.",

We passed these on via 105 reports to the police. We've also passed them on to Ryan and Mandy as well.  We're doing everything that we can to identify the offenders so that we can, excuse me, we can possibly get them off the roads. The, where are we? Yeah. Oh yes, we've been communicating with our neighbours. We've got a,  messenger chat group that we all tee up with each other and tell each other what's happening, where it's happening, so that we can support each other when these events happen, just to try to observe and try to record and try to prevent more of it escalating over time. We've also emailed the Waip\u0101 District Mayor  We've emailed MP Barbara Kuriga. We've emailed several emails to different departments within the Council also. Along with all of our communications with the Council, we've also submitted complaints to the Independent Police Conduct Authority.  regarding the lacklustre response that we're getting on 111 calls in general. We're not getting much of a positive response on emergency calls, and we are often not even getting any response from local police attending any of these events in the case of these board racing meetings, et cetera.  which is quite disturbing for us because police is pretty much all we have. That's pretty much it from us, I think.",

    "text": "So my involvement with this has come about mainly through the liaison I have with CommSafe. Historically, the 111 calls that come through for not just this area don't necessarily come to me. But just over several conversations with Mandy, it became quite apparent that there was an issue out there.  Working with the community, we're trying to come up with a bit of an action plan from the policing perspective. A couple of points that were raised from Shelly and Leslie, it's not entirely safe for them to be having to go out there and collect that information in the first place. And what's practically, that's what the police need. The burden of proof to get someone to court and to take their car is fairly high.  in the form of statements, and when they're out there taking videos and photographs of these guys, it makes them targets. I mean, Sally's house is right next to that landing, and they all know that she lives there, and if they see her taking footage of them doing it and passing it off to us, she becomes a target, and we need to take that away from, take that burden off her somehow. The residents of Pukeatua have funded  a camera system, which I believe is partway through implementation at the moment, which will go a long way to helping with that. Our big problem from the police is resourcing. If there's 50 or 60 cars out there, it's just not safe to send one lone patrol car out there. And if we do happen to blunder across something along those lines,  we're not gonna get out of the car and start stopping every single person and getting their details. And we need to see them doing burnouts effectively for us to be able to act. Often, if we do get a car out there, they're parked up on the side of the road. And I think a method of control for that would be around the cruising part of the bylaw. For example, Christchurch has one where I think it's 90 days, they slap a sticker on the car,  and if it's seen within 90 days, we can impound the car, that's probably the biggest punishment they're gonna get, losing their car for 28 days, and that's at their cost. They don't pay their court fines, that'll be converted to community service down the track, but when they lose their car, they will get it out, especially if it's mum and dad's car. So that's probably the biggest thing that I would like to see change, is having something added into the bylaw to prevent them from parking up  in those places in the first place. Because from there, we've got all sorts of evidence gathering. Most Fonterra tankers that frequent that area, they all have dash cam, for example. So we've got that evidence. And again, it takes it away from Sally and the other residents down there from having to do it themselves. And the other part of it is the environmental issues down there. For example, I went down on a,  a couple of weeks ago, and all of those wooden barriers around that gravel pit on the corner of Rodanata Road, they're all just hacked up and have been used for firewood. That's ratepayers' bloody firewood, in my view. A steel armco would go a long way to fixing that up, all that cheese grater stuff, and maybe gating up that gravel pit so they can't access it in the first place, and then having an armco on either side of the road  Recently, I took a prisoner up to Spring Hill and at the on-ramp, off-ramp there, off the motorway, that was the biggest spot in New Zealand for boy racer activity until about 12 months ago. You'd get three or 400 cars from all over the upper North Island congregating there most Saturdays and Sundays, sorry, Fridays and Saturdays. And the method to fix that was simply a raised traffic island.  and for the on-ramp and in the middle of the road, it took the environment away from them so they can't do burnouts there. And the intersection is largely fixed now, and they haven't really had to spend a lot of dollars to keep it fixed. So those are the sort of things that I think we could look at in this area and going forward, you know, over time, other areas where they like to congregate.  I don't think I've got anything else off the top of my head at the moment.",

I worked on one in South Auckland when I first joined the police, and it was really effective, but we had staff to burn for that. We had three sections of, I think it was eight staff, and so we were virtually 24-7 on the problem. The Waikato doesn't quite have those resources.  The highway patrol unit is the one that is sort of tasked with looking at this problem, but they're based in Hamilton, and they're spread from Huntly all the way down to Pew Pew. So the scale of the problem is just huge. I am trying to talk to my bosses into changing our tactics a little bit on how we deal with it, and I've got a couple of ideas up my sleeve.

    "text": "Okay, thank you for having me, guys. I think this will be fairly brief.  I just really from my perspective as you all know my main role is to do the neighbourhood support and I really want to congratulate Sally and Leslie because from a neighbourhood support perspective they are doing everything above and beyond  and everything that we've suggested that they can do to help with their community and collect the information. So, you know, not all the time do I have that sort of help in areas. So, you know, as far as our community goes as an area, it's been fantastic because the whole community has come together to really try and target this problem.  But as you know, from my perspective, we've got this problem Waip\u0101wai, right? We've got Rukahea, we've got Gillab, we've got P\u0101hui, Cambridge, Tamirau, Aspen Road, Arapuni, you know, Ng\u0101ti Pori, the list goes on, you know.  And I think it's really important that we can have a really clear conduit of information running between myself, the council, police, to try and come up with ways to stop this behaviour. Because as you heard, it's not just a police issue, it's not just a community issue, and it's definitely not just a council issue. We all need to work  together to try and solve this. I am at the point now where I feel that I can only help the individuals from the community, support them in different situations. For example, there's some family members in Arapuni with young children. Those young children, as you can imagine,  care things from the parents' perspective, which are not so positive. The children actually become quite scared, they get heightened anxiety because they can hear these vehicles. You know, there's that whole side of the behaviour that's coming through within these families, and as I say, not just in Arapuni, that we need to be able to support the community better with.  So I don't really have a lot else to add. You guys have probably seen what I wrote for Anj and sent that in. Just if there's anything else from my perspective or any other help that we can do, we know that these answers are available. Thank you, Brian. You know, we've talked about reducing that speed.  Problem is, is we're still waiting and I understand there's a law change coming and we can't get that to happen. Bulmers has been great. Brad has been really helpful and, you know, putting those concrete blocks in and actually getting Bulmers closed. But the problems that we need to deal with are really, they need prompt action.  and it's kind of like I'm starting to feel just as frustrated as the residents because you can't help them anymore if that makes sense like you know you're making all the connections for people and they're doing everything that they can but at this point in time it's like  what else can we do to help? So really, if there's any advice that you can give me, I'm more than happy to open to any other suggestions. But that's kind of where I'm at. And of course,  this is Waip\u0101 wide and you need to keep thinking about that because we can possibly solve some of these Arapuni issues quickly if we're able to, but of course, how we deal with that Waip\u0101 wide is definitely an issue. So thank you very much, guys. Excuse me, Andy.",

No, I've just got one quick comment to make, Mandy, and that's because Te Aumutu Community Board covers Te Aumutu community and Kakapuku, that is why we are focusing on this part of the district. However, we have been in discussion, so I've already spoken with Sue Milner,  and ask for them to have a look into. So if you want to follow that up at all as a chair of the Cambridge Community Board, and we were going to be having discussions with the Pirongia Ward Committee as well, so that all of us are coming back together to give the message to council that is important to all of our areas through Waip\u0101. So hopefully we will address everywhere, but I'm guessing that  It's a base, it's a case of starting somewhere, getting the ball rolling, getting this bylaw sorted out, which will hopefully, well, which will definitely be able to be used by everybody and just get started and hopefully lead by example. And then we'll get those other community board and council, of course, on board to actually make that happen. But starts with you guys and yeah, huge thank you for coming along and joining us tonight.  because that's where we need to start and it's really important to hear your voice. So we're going to jump to item nine, which is the notice of motion in regard to the situation. It's a fairly hefty report there, so I'm not going to read through the whole thing.

They don't respect anybody or any property. Yeah, your things that you want to put in place, the speed restriction would be great,  I believe this is a nationwide thing, that we have to also be pushing police and the government for this, because this is, you do, you sort out Arapuni, they'll move somewhere else, and they are already going around. They are very mobile. This bylaw could help and get a few cars taken off them for a little while, but they will turn up somewhere else and  I would like to see more cameras put in place so that they could be utilised. Perhaps the police have dash cams in their cars, which should be something. Why not address that as well? Put it to the police. I was around when the boy racer squad was here, and they effectively killed Moth. And that was fantastic. So that should be put back to the police  organise it if it's such a great problem, which it is, but highlight it back to them. Make them, they are the ones that will be prosecuting. So they are the ones that need to get the information. And the best way to get it is from them turning up in force. And if you've got a dedicated group, they can do it. They know the stuff, they know the people. They know who's involved.  That's my thoughts anyway.",

I think we have to be realistic about the levers we have to pull as a district council and certainly that bylaw amendment is a pretty obvious one to me. In terms of the traffic calming features and potentially the kind of more costly infrastructure kind of works, that might be slightly more difficult. But if there are cheap and easy wins, then by all means, let's have it all assessed. I think that's a really sensible way forward. But yeah, it is definitely, as Mandy said,  A district wide, and I'd hazard a guess, it's a nationwide kind of problem, particularly in rural areas. And they are a movable feast, but I do think we understand where their Achilles is, which is the car. Ryan's right, they don't get a toss about fines. And having a chat with a police officer recently, it became apparent that actually they're not all as young as you think they are. And despite the fact that some of them refer to themselves as car enthusiasts, they're not actually. They're people that enjoy breaking the law.  and damaging property and vandalising and terrorising communities. So, look, I'm 100% behind you and let's focus in on the really quick ones that can be made with a long-term view to get this public by-law place amended as soon as we can to give Ryan and his lot a bit more grant.",

    "text": "Thank you, Madam Chair. I've been listening quite closely. I've actually had an experience with this, and personally. So, yeah, been out on the road, had to stop. They'd covered the whole road, so it was quite an issue. I absolutely agree that we have to pass this motion. I do feel that there is the one weak point with them all is a car. That's the one thing I keep coming back to. We can remove that. We've removed the problem.  It's something that is not considered, unfortunately, with the right situation, we can't seem to do that. With infrastructure, I agree with Susan, Waikato-Katahi has been rather reticent with any funding at the moment, so we would have to share that with them, because these are highways that we're dealing with, they're not local roads, they're actually highways, and we would struggle, I think, to get the funding. However, we can do such things as enforcing the gate,  on the gravel pit. I think that made sense to me. And actually, seeing if we can get AMCOs, that'd be great. But the big thing, I think, is that having the cameras and getting our local tanker drivers, et cetera, infrastructure together, they've got dash cameras, and a lot of people do have them, and utilize that information to be able to identify these cars and get at the core of the problem to take the cars away from them. So that, to me, is the answer to the whole problem.  These people survive only whilst they've got cars. So if we can actually identify and actually retain those vehicles for a while. I actually go back to Judith Crusher Collins and say she had a great idea. We could use that perhaps in these days and times, but unfortunately it is against the laws at the moment. One thing I would like to say, we should actually coordinate and cooperate with other local councils. This is not just a Waipa thing, it actually exists  Waikato, it actually exists in Otahonga, it exists down in Waitomo. So it is around. So I think we ought to work collective approach and work together. And maybe that would mean the bylaw would be more easily enforced.",

And my first thought was that your land transport should be putting up judder bars and 50k signs but then they're just going to move to wherever they are. So someone mentioned that in Hamilton they had a task force  Because it's public knowledge that the police will go to a crime if it's very serious, but if it's something and it's under control, then they've got more important things to do. And like Ryan said, if it's one person, they're not going to get out of their car and do anything. So I think maybe when it is such a big problem, they do need a task force.  just for a few weeks to have some extra staff to try and do something about it and get the cars taken off them. As a few of you have said, that's the important thing. They don't want their cars to be taken off them. Although I know one boy racer who's got five cars. So, you know, once the five cars are gone, I suppose he'll stop.  But, yeah, no, it's not an easy answer. But the roads, the main highways aren't, you know, the road transport's responsibility. But, you know, whether they'll work with us doing something, they may not. But, no, I think a taskforce needs to happen just to hit it on the head. But, yeah, I'm so pleased I haven't got that in my area. It wouldn't be very pleasant at all. Yeah. Thank you.",

This project is to include, A, ensuring that all known boy racing road locations are covered by the provisions in clause 29.3 of the Waipa District Council Public Places Bylaw, and B, undertaking physical works to install deterrents where appropriate  roads and beams in the areas that have been identified as key locations of concern.

I'll take the report as read, but there's just a couple of points that I'd like to highlight. Firstly, we've had a number of inquiries relating to the Kiiki town clock repair. So I thought I'd just give you a brief update on that. The safe access and structural works have been completed on that. We've engaged a contractor to refurbish the clock, the clock dials and the clock face.  And this work will commence late January next year with the scaffold going up. And we're hoping to have that clock operational again sometime in March. Secondly,  The work on the TA band rotunda has been substantially complete. We're just waiting on the new lights and some electrical connections to go in to be installed. So there's just been a slight delay with that, but we're hoping to get that very early in the new year completed. We've had quite a bit of positive feedback from the community on that bit of work as well. So, and those were the two points I wanted to make, so I'm happy to take any questions.",

And often those multiple layers have been  Yeah, sort of potentially overlooked. So something that could have, let's say six aspects of ownership has only been recorded as having two. So the other four have now been discovered, although they've always been there, we've just now just captured it. So it's quite a technical argument, but it does read really poorly.

    "text": "Okay, much better looking, much better looking Brad then, eh?  So, just a couple of things to highlight from Brad's report, just recognising that this was to the 30th of September, the quarter that's just gone. So, as you'll know, just recently, initial consultation on the skate park renewal and development projects has started, and we've held some events with the community over the last week.  So both Brad and Gina have talked to you about that project previously, and it was great to get those initial consultation events underway and to receive that feedback. You'll also identify what you've already talked about within the meeting is the amount of vandalism that is happening across the parks and public toilets.  So you're well aware of that with the earlier discussion. For the team, this has been frustrating and quite heartbreaking for the staff and the contractors who have to respond to this and also make our, to fix our spaces. So you would have heard some of the feedback earlier on how we're doing that around Bulmers Landing.  And so from that perspective, there is a programme of work to add security to some of the hot spots across the district. And these include both Bulmer's Land and Te Aumutu Cemetery. Some of the measures is what you've already talked about, involves security cameras, speed bumps, additional or renewed bollards and gating.  So those will be going into those locations, but obviously there needs to be that combined effort that you've discussed earlier around those road areas as well, and not just in the parks itself. The libraries team have been doing a fantastic job. They've had some record-breaking days in recent weeks with the volume of books being issued. So they're doing great from that, and a lot of their programmes have been online, very similar to the Te Aumutu Museum,  and they have also been doing programs online, but their Tui and Tama club is growing in numbers during this quarter, which is also great. The team has also presented initial discussion with Ng\u0101iwi Topo o Waip\u0101 and is progressing three pieces of work for concept plans for the district cemeteries.  So looking at what we need to do in all of our cemeteries across the district to include new roadways, new berm areas and also burial spaces within those cemeteries. There's also concept plans will be developed with the wider community for all of our lakeside reserves and that will be over the next year and a bit.  and the team are also starting to look at a review of our lease model for our sports parks. So all of those were funded through the LTP that the team has started works on. So while there's been some challenges, the report provides you with a brief snapshot of what the team has been working on, and I'm happy to try and answer any questions you have. So yeah, thank you for that.",

And just a quick mention, the gates on the cemetery were shut again the other night when we were on patrol.  the security people are obviously back up there closing it again which is good to see because for a number of patrols it was just all of the gates were wide open and you could go up there willy-nilly so that probably wasn't helping your vandalism and burglary statistics much with those gates open like that at night.

    "text": "Thank you, Madam Chair. So the report is up to the end of October and on the second page of the report there, it lists the works and things that are happening around the district at the moment and including resurfacing, which is being quite widespread across the district and in the urban areas. So a lot of chip sealing and asphalt work has been done.  I heard just the other day that the Mangapiko footbridge is nearing completion with the linking concrete footpaths joined up now at each end, and that's looking really good. So there's a little bit more railing work there to do, but it will be open to use very soon.  Then there is, under the street lighting, there's an area of interest there with Pollard Drive. So we have engaged a street light design consultant to come up with a design for that. And he's promised to have that to me before Christmas so we can put it in the hands of our lighting contractor to get that actioned in the new year.  You'll be aware that we had a budget of $150,000 for streetlight improvements, but Waka Kotahi did not fund any of that type of improvement work for the next three years. So we've only got half that sum. We've got $75,000 a year. And the initial advice I have is that all of that will be required to upgrade the Pala Drive area.  Then under the CCTV service, so we have engaged City Safe to be reviewing and helping us with a strategy for CCTV going forward, and that's to make sure we're getting the right mix of  camera types and locations to be satisfying as much as possible the community safety and security type elements of the CCTV system along with the traffic parts of it. So there's a meeting this week with CitySafe to kick that off, but the bulk of the work happening early in the new year  which will then give us a decent strategy for the next 10 years as to how we use that system and investment that will happen going forward.  Then under the footpath works is a list of some works that have started already or underway, but there is more to be done there. And then after that, just the community road safety education programme, which is a bit delayed in many areas because of COVID and not being able to do face to face activities.  But we've made the best of what we can do in that area and you'll see billboards and other things changed in community. Things like the drink drive messaging and everything for Christmas, all of that stuff has been rolled out. So it's probably a good place to pause and just take any questions.",

We just heard from a group of concerned ratepayers from Pukeatua, and they were talking about, you know, having upgrades of some of the facilities on that road, particularly replacing some of the wooden barriers with Armco and others.

It costs about $150 a metre to buy and install the standard guardrail and then each of the terminal ends.  which have to be designed to collapse on impact with a vehicle and not spare the vehicle, each of those terminal ends cost anything from four and a half to six thousand dollars each. So even a relatively short piece of guardrail can still cost upwards of twenty thousand dollars pretty easily. So yes, there are some limitations in the budget because of the funding cuts. So we would have to be  prudent and recognize that a lot of that spending we're trying to target areas where people are having serious accidents or fatal accidents as opposed to areas where something might happen because of boy races. So it's quite a...  it would be quite difficult to do widespread works to do this, to counter this problem, just simply because of the costs of doing that work. Yeah.",

Yeah, thanks, Susan. You know, to just get a bit of a costing so we know and then that gets built into the budget so we can start picking off those places.

It has to be well lit so that you don't accidentally drive into it at night because you're turning at an intersection, your headlights are pointing in one direction and you're going in another.  and then you run over the island or, you know, hurt yourself. So those areas have to be lit. So, yes, it is possible and we just have to see, you know, what are the possible costs for that and how would we prioritise it?

We did, you know, in the 2018 bylaw, include the same wording that Hamilton City have in their bylaw, which I think they garnered from either Auckland or Tauranga City, who had had the problems. But what I have seen over the years and having spent 10 years in the Bay of Plenty, where Western Bay District and Tauranga City certainly had this problem,  They had bylaws and they had signs, but the only thing that truly fixed it was when police put a task force together, sort of went undercover, collected the information. They confiscated or locked up dozens and dozens of vehicles in a warehouse somewhere, secretly hidden away. And when the racers found that they were at high risk of having their vehicles removed,  and they had to pay to get them back, then it had a really big impact across the city very quickly. So while there's things that we might be able to do, I suspect it's going to be similar that unless the police really get stuck in and enforce the law, then we may be chasing this activity around the district.",

I highly doubt that the community will just sit back and take this policy. There is already a give a little set up to take Waipahu District Council to court. And if legal action fails, I imagine there will be further protest action.  In the document provided, it talks about how Gary Diet will have considerable knowledge of the views of the community holds in relation to COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates. And as I said before, so as Gary aware of the fortnightly protests over the country for the last eight weeks, the major protest in Parliament and the one on Thursday. In regards to the implementation of the passport, people are mingling and mixing regardless at places like supermarkets and the general activity and day to day.  and stores with store owners are just ignoring the passport mandates anyway. People are mingling as they do. But here's the thing, these mandates are coercion. People are being coerced into taking a medical treatment that is now being shown to cause major health issues. People ask why people would not take the vaccine. For one, it is causing harm. There are multiple examples of people being vaccine injured.  There are heart-related issues arising as a result of the vaccine. Japan has just put a warning on the Pfizer vaccine that the vaccine has the adverse risk of myocarditis. This is damage to the heart. The second part is that it is unnecessary. The recovery rate of COVID is 99.97%, similar to the seasonal flu.  New Zealand has 500 deaths per year on average from the seasonal flu. We don't use passports or mandate the flu or the vaccine. There are councils that have chosen not to implement mandatory passports, such as the ones in Taraki and Lower Hutt. Jacinda Ardern has said that she wanted to create a two-tier society, and she's having it created by the likes of Gary Diet and, now that I learned tonight, Waipae District Council.  There is a significant effect on the mental health of the community by not having access to gyms, libraries, et cetera. The report has stated that the facilities are available to use and not on a use basis. This to me is unbelievably, just unbelievable. Waip\u0101 District Council is stopping completely healthy people from entering facilities that they have paid for.  Personally, I think it is a bloody disgrace, and I hope the community board members support this motion to stop this policy immediately. Thank you very much. Okay, thanks, Cain.",

This is the central government. I can't go to my gym downtown here without having a card. I can't go to the RSA unless I have a vaccine card. All right, these are regulated. Okay, the point that's from the decision was made with careful consultation with Gary and the members of our council,  and he's still in discussion with his staff. The problem we have is under health and safety, all of our staff are liable, as to say, to be protected from any infection. And we as a council have to take the position of protecting our staff from the likelihood of being infected. This is the way we looked at the whole situation. I know that it's not something that agrees with everybody,  but we've got to take the issue to where it belongs, to the central government, who has got the traffic light system together, who's created the infrastructure, and we have to just simply operate within these infrastructures. Unfortunately, but a fact.",

And Lesovich staff, and I'm picking Gary wasn't particularly enamoured with the thought of having to make what could be an unpopular call on some fronts.  But I guess I just want to underline that our vaccination rate now in Waip\u0101 has hit, double vaccination rate has hit 91%. So obviously there's a fairly overwhelming majority of people in our district who have faith in science, who have committed to a course of action in a manner that is, I guess, in line with central government's thinking.  Look, as I say, get back to that whole notion that we were stuck in a position where we have to make a call or Gary had to make a call and it was supported by elected members to protect our staff first and foremost.

I mean, we have them occasionally for other  long-standing board members. It is quite unusual, and I think we just need to look at them on their merit. This conference that we allocated it to was stopped by COVID, which is completely out of their hands. It wasn't them just changing their mind at the first point. And secondly, they're asking for money to go towards something that is really helpful. It's a capital expenditure, which is almost probably a better investment than  possibly than the one they were previously making. So has anyone else got any other comments?

I mean, I was standing way back and people were slowing right down and looking at me to see if I was gonna walk across the road. Seeing the kids be able to just walk across there. One batch of children actually stood quite,  you know, like stunned mullets that the car was waiting for them to be able, you know, for them to cross using the crossing. And I'm standing there trying to shoo them across the road saying, it's a pedestrian crossing, you're allowed to walk across there. They've got to wait for you now. So a huge thanks and really stoked to see those things happen.  However, I'm not gonna let that slow us down. You'll see in our report that I got included the recommendations that we've made to date. So Richard, we put all those in there. So now I think we need to get back onto that McDonald's down to the toilet footpath marking. And maybe we need to focus on that and also that retainer wall  as being the two probably next most pressing things to happen down there. But yes, super stoked to see that and even more happy with the response and the way the traffic was going. But any comments around whether you think we should press ahead with carrying on with the George Street project now that those main things actually have been addressed? Richard, I'll start with you because I know this is  something that's been, you've been closely involved with many years, for many years.",

I don't know if you have, but it doesn't actually need to, you know, like the amount it would need to go back to create a footpath along there inside the cars. It doesn't actually need to get that steep. I originally thought it was going to get really steep and need to be quite a big retainer wall, but it's sort of quite flat in there, especially at the toilet end. So, you know, hopefully it wouldn't be too expensive.  But anyway, has anyone else got any comments on that? So I might just need to amend my recommendation a little bit.

And then just in regard to the policy review, so we've got those coming up. So this wasn't so much an official recommendation, but it would really be very much appreciated if we can  get out and talk to our respective people in the community around that gambling policy and the local alcohol. I mean, Lou, you're right in the thick of it with running pokies at the RSA. It'd be great maybe if someone that that's your area of expertise, I imagine a little bit too, to have a look through that gambling and alcohol policy and just anything that jumps out to you. I know I've got a couple of things  in regard to the local alcohol policy that I would like to raise. And I'd really love to have it actually considered as part of the information that goes out for the public to comment on.  but whether that happens or it's still just as a submission. But in particular, it was around the location. So our location in our local alcohol policy says that the venue that's wanting to go in as a liquor store can't be within a certain radius of other types of shops or education places.  And I just think that that needs to be a little bit looser because in the one that I went along to and put in an objection to, the kindy was right behind it. So, you know, people parked by it, people walked past it. The fact that it wasn't right in front of it kind of seemed pretty sad if it had got through. It was, another pun tonight, a blessing in disguise that the church,  that isn't currently there being the Presbyterian St. Andrew's Church actually did narrowly fall in that radius and that was what gave them the teeth and basically the people that were making the application said we're snookered here and backed away. But yeah, I've waffled on a bit long, love for us to really get in behind this and actually have some  constructive comment to go back to Graham with around that. There's a little mock-up of the battery stand, so that's what she's going to look like. Sally said I got way too excited thinking that the artwork was going to be printed by the end of last week, but hopefully it won't be too far away and we'll be already set to get that in.  It better happen soon because the bins currently are at my place and they're filling up pretty fast with batteries from around our house. So it works pretty good, so we'll see how we go. But Richard, you'll be pleased to know that I'm there, virtually. So, yeah. So that's me. Just to speak on that, Madam Chair. You most certainly must.",

So I thought that could be a great opportunity if we get to that point or just even in conjunction to give people an alternative  that they can come along to the e-waste days and be able to purchase the stickers with the milk bottles. I don't think I'll try and complicate it with asking Pack and Save to do them on behalf, but I definitely think that we could put a little bit of information there. And especially if we did meet our quota,  that that could be a good option for the remainder of the year to say, look, if you want to get rid of your batteries, this is an option. Otherwise, all going well, we'll be back again next year with our stand ready to take some more. So, yeah, that's that. So that's my report, which I haven't moved, have I? No, you haven't done Wattles either. Oh, did I miss the Wattles, Richard? Oh, better go back to the Wattles.  What did I say about the wattles? Did I put the wattles in there? Oh, yes, I did. Sorry, I must have shot past it. What will they think? Another pun. We're on a roll tonight. Except for I can't find the wattles on my copy. Page four. Two?",

    "text": " Oh, that's why, because I'd gone to the bottom of the page, oh my God. So yes, we caught up with Hilary and Colin, and you'll see there that we're organising another pulling day for Saturday the 12th, with a rain day on Saturday the 19th. I have hopefully got a team of able-bodied lacrosse players, so we're probably looking about  11 or 12 of them with a bit of luck to come and help as a give back to the community activity for their club. I'm hoping Lou might be able to talk to the cadets again and I need to follow up with the Kiwanis because they had indicated that they might be able to get some people. Trying a Saturday this time so I will also go back to  Murray Downs and see if there's anyone from the Latter Day Saints. They had half a dozen or so people there as well. So anyone that you think might be interested, I did try to see if the councillors today would be keen to come along. But Colin's suggesting if we could get sort of 30 odd people up there, it shouldn't take us long and it'd be just a walk through and pull out all these little wattles and really knock them back.  Yeah, did you have any other questions on the wattles? Cool, so that's the wattles. Ah yes, and then Merry Christmas to everybody. So yeah, thank you to everyone. Really appreciate it. It's been a bit frustrating this year and with Zoom, it does make it a little bit trickier. Super big thank you to Sally, Joe and Jill again.  You guys are definitely my right hand ladies. I wouldn't know what to do without you and really appreciate all the work that you do at our meetings and also behind the scenes and making sure that everything runs smoothly and people that need to be contacted are board members. Yeah, again, thank you so much. I know you give up a lot of time over and above the meeting nights.  So really, really appreciate that and your support through the year. And a thank you to Gary too, even though he's not here again for all the work that he did. So you do have a wonderful, safe Christmas and summer holiday and deserve your very well-deserved break with family and friends. So if I could recommend that my report is received and get someone to second that. Is that your hand, Jill? Yep, Jill, thank you. And all in favor?  against, carried. So, oh, I did forget something, didn't I? I always do. I'll put it through in February. It was just in regard to the condition of the track and that budget, but that's something that would come through in the annual plan. But if we are, like, it'd be great to see us support that  I just want to whip back there for a quick moment. Hilary commented that the budget for those guys is around about 14,000 and a fairly significant chunk of it goes towards pest management. So they do have a really small budget. So I do think that, especially in light of the condition of the track and things, that it would be a great opportunity to just get  that increased. It doesn't have to be a significant amount, but enough to make sure that some of those annual maintenance or biannual maintenance programs can be completed so that it stays tidy, that it's not doing water damage to the rest of the mauna. So you just put your thinking caps on for that. So sorry for  through you Ange, Sally are you able to tell me that so that pest management is that largely possums and animals and so flora and fauna both they have yeah they do have a bit of a budget to get rid of Sally correct me if I'm wrong but I've got this right from Hillary and there are some  tree species that are identified as weeds. The brush wattle, even though it is a weed, it's not designated as a pest. Have I got that right? So the budget doesn't go for the wattles, but there are other types of shrubs and weed stuff. So weed spraying, actually, I think which comes back to you guys, Sally, doesn't it?  under parks, doesn't it, the spraying? So if I can, yeah, if I can come through the chair.",

But I know our boys used to make quite a bit of money tracking possums on our farm and plucking them and yeah, turning it into whatever they wanted with their pocket money from it. So I don't know whether there is a potential there for there to be some discussion with anybody around the place that wants to, you know, come in and track for free.  because it's free for us, but they make money out of it and we get rid of the possums. Possums are the main problem.",

So have we got anything there? It's kind of a bit hard with COVID, isn't it, to get to see many people? No, I just have a couple of things, sorry. So one is I've done talk to you about the warehouse car park. Just wanted to give you a quick update, the who are we group. So we have had one little get together.  I'm meeting with Shane and Maria tomorrow to nut out some questions, because what we want to be doing is to be trying to be getting going with everything as close, as early in the year as possible. So sort of February, March at the latest, to start getting questions and surveys and things out to get that feedback back. So we just wanted to sort of, we're going to  sit down tomorrow and try and make a bit of a plan of, you know, like getting extra people on board and things like that. So, yeah, that's happening tomorrow. And I just wanted to mention, I did do the presentation today for council. I highlighted a number of things that we've done through the year.  I'm happy to send you out a copy of the presentation. There was a couple of things that came up. So our flags, of course, we went and got with Te Awamutu Community Board. But of course, if the representation review recommendation goes through, we become the Te Awamutu Kihikihi Community Board. So we've got our beautiful new flags.  which we're probably not going to be able to use for all that long, but we at least got some flags. So there was that. Who else have I been in touch with? There was one other one, but it escapes me right now, so I'm picking it can't have been too important, but I think the report went all right, did it, Lou and Susan? I think we kind of covered a few bases. Yeah, it went pretty well. Yeah, thank you.  And it was good to to be able to have that opportunity. So yeah, if no one else has got anything further.",
