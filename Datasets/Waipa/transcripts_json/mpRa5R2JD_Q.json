So we feel, I'm the chairperson for the Community Association in Porongia and we just feel that the representation, Porongia is quite unique in its setting and just it's quite different from the other like Te Amuru or Cambridge. And we just feel quite strongly that  we do need to be represented in a different way from Te Amuru and Cambridge. We're not really sure what format that would take, whether that would be a board or the association, but we feel with having a local councillor in the form of Claire currently, that that does represent our needs, that we can go to her with that. So,  Yeah, that was really just all I had was just I feel that we definitely do need a representation for our area because we are quite different. And we do take in a lot of rural regions as well under that, because one of the things that we we just went to clear on would be where the Pyrrhonia Ward would sit in the new model. I don't know if anybody can actually clarify that for me or not.  Yeah, so that was the only question I had and just, yeah. Sorry, it's been a bit big.

But the proposal is that Pirongi and Kekupuku would be joined and  and the boundaries shifted a little bit for Kaipake, which currently sits in Pirongia, to move largely to Cambridge. So that area would still have two councillors, but previously, of course, it had three. Te Aumutu would move from four to three, Cambridge from five to four, and we have one extra councillor being the M\u0101ori ward.  So, yes, I think everyone would accept that Cambridge is unique, as, of course, are all our communities, I guess. Yeah, so does anyone have any questions for Ruth?",

But I think the most important thing from our point of view is that the right people are doing the leadership of whatever that looks like, and that it's properly funded, really, at the end of the day. So two councillors or three is almost secondary to whether we've got that representation that allows us to feed into council and bring information back. Yeah, the construct of that is secondary, really.  What we have to make sure, though, is that whatever it is, there's a mandate from the community, whether that is a ward committee or an association or a board or a councillor, that for us is kind of the bottom line, is that there's recognition of that representation at council level, whatever that looks like.

    "text": " Can you hear me OK? Yes. OK, thanks. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to speak to just the community board subject, obviously exclusively today. And I want to do that because I provided, as you mentioned, quite a bit of supporting material and I wanted to ensure participants had an opportunity to discuss the aspects with me in this sort of forum.  And so, for the record, I've just provided details around some of the representation process and some of the media and correspondence I've received, and also my experience of attending community board meetings and also presenting to them. I've also included the original Circulated Option 2 document, which was out in the community for a while before this review, and also extracts from the 2021  resident survey, which is quite supportive of my position. And I'd like to also confirm that I've consulted widely with the community before drafting my proposal option two and also the submission. So, there's a document there amongst it called summation. And so, I just really like to talk to the key community components that have come out of my consultation.  and their points numbers one to six, and then I'd be keen to hear some feedback. And I guess I'm a little bit unique in that I presented probably a roadmap or a template for what I believe a community engagement sort of entity or entities could look like and where I think this should or could go. So, basically, these are the key points in and around why community boards currently aren't effective.  So, really, they don't reflect or represent the community currently. So, I believe that a structure that involves eight members, some elected, some selected, will represent a better balance. And I've included as an example of selected Grey Power Council, I think, social providers, iwi, to give the representation, the balance that it needs and the reach that it needs.  It's not conclusive, but it's the direction I think that the council need to go in for engagement. The second point, community members, community board members are sometimes time, knowledge and governance poor. And that's really the case. And so effective engagement is very difficult to do when you've got other things to do. You've got limited time and distractions and different skill sets.  So, what I've proposed, and I guess it mirrors very much in a minor way, or maybe minor is not quite the right word, what the council currently does itself. So, you have an elected governance group of people and you have council to enact policy and process for the community. So, what I'm saying is you need to mirror that really with the community board structure and you need to have dedicated managers, and these are dedicated managers, who can do the work, the liaison work and the community work  on behalf of a governance group so that the skills are better represented, and time is better used, and there's better liaison with the council, and basically better outcomes achieved for all the groups that are involved. That's a critical area. I think it's very difficult to ask volunteer, effectively volunteer people or elected volunteer people to come to the party and achieve the outcomes that I think the community are wanting now, and are certainly demonstrating they're wanting.  The third point, Council doesn't really acknowledge or adequately acknowledge or represent the community boards and therefore the community. And I think that's more the case now, as other forms are reporting on. So, I've put in here that really come to the table is sort of the exercise. There's been a time that sort of started to come through these presentations.  I think the managers, the managers, not any representatives of the actual community board, the managers need to be sitting on the representative subcommittees and have a voting right in that particular situation, just like iwi. I think the community is pretty important. They need to be heard and sure they can go through a better channel of community engagement. But they also need to sit at the council table.  and they need to make sure that their decisions or what they believe is actually taken seriously and ratified in a voting process. Point four, community boards cost too much or are a waste of time. Well, they clearly cost too much. I've included the figures in there. If you continue with the current structure, it's going to cost over $1.2 million. And really, in the fiscal environment we're in, for the outcomes that are being achieved, that's really just not acceptable.  There are ways around that, and the charitable entity status is one that I've indicated. I certainly believe that obviously targeting the way that council spends its money in the community area is important, but by changing the status and allowing for the boards themselves to be independent and going and seeking independent funds, you'll take a burden off rate payers and the community, and you'll also expose those entities to a better access to funds. And believe me, the funds are out there,  if they are professionally gathered. So, there's a combination of factors. Certainly, the council still need to pay for the entities, but not to the level they currently are. It must be better targeted. Bulk funding. Yes, there is funding that goes through the community boards, but it's not enough and it's not particularly well targeted. And the outcomes, I believe, for the majority of the  of the grants would possibly be doubtful if you look at what they achieve. So what I'm saying is you need to significantly fund more into the area with the right entity. And you need to do that on the basis that there is more control over some of those funds, but those funds must also be much more targeted.  and they must be much more discretionary and managed better so that the money that goes into this area is applied to the community so there actually are outcomes that come back. There are many providers out there, but not all of them provide actually any real returns to the community. Final point of those points, community boards won't last and can be removed by the mayor and councillors anyway. And what about amalgamation?  So that's the risk that's faced here is effectively anything that exists now or may exist is going to be subject to not the whims, but the decision making of other people and also amalgamation, which is clearly on the horizon. What you need to do is put, I guess, a parochial view aside and ask yourself, what would I want to be in place if I wasn't here? And so the structure that I've proposed as a draft structure  allows for that because it'll have a slightly different status. It won't be able to be changed and it might survive anything that happens. And I think if you want proper community engagement and you want it ongoing, that's the sort of residents and the community in general in that order feel they've got a long term relationship with whatever happens in the council space.  So broadly, that's what I wanted to sort of just speak to, but I'm more than happy to hear back because there is a lot in there. And as I said, it really is sort of like a future document as to what you could do. But quite clearly, my position, which may not be clear, but quite clearly, my position is no community boards.  which I believe should have been the decision that's made or be made previous to this representation. And that'll give you the opportunity to actually find something that's fit for purpose, that works in here, represents the community and is a fiscally responsible group or groups. Tell me what you think.",

    "text": " Well, I guess, so the short answer is no, I haven't really looked internally, because if you look at internal governance in New Zealand, you either have them or you don't have them, if you're looking at community boards. So, for instance, Hamilton don't have them and they don't want them. So, in my discussions with other councils, and I've discussed things with about six councils,  Hamilton don't need them, don't want them, they engage with the community adequately. So that's an option, obviously, for you to consider, because there are councils out there with them and there are councils out there without them. But so I haven't, this format doesn't really exist per se, but the components of it really do, because I guess you've got to ask yourself, if you're a community member,  what would you want? How would you want to engage? And how do you reach in? And the resident survey is probably telling you quite a few things about what people think about engaging, firstly, and about what they think about what can be achieved. So this to me, the reason I spend time and effort onto it, and I don't normally spend time and effort on some things, only things that I think matter, I think this matters, because you're not reaching the community adequately now, and you need to, and the components that I've taken out that I've gone through here are  really what people have told me about what they think matters to them, and those are some of the solutions that I believe you wrap around it. But I think you also have to have an independent group, two independent groups, but you need to protect them, obviously, for the things that may change, but you need to be able to make them even more independent because of, I guess, things that could affect them in the future. You want community to have some continuity,  And that's where I think I've tried to go here. But it's a draft. Believe me, it's not a perfect document in any shape or form. But for once in my life, I've probably listened to more people than I normally would. And so in listening to those people, they've really brought those aspects to the table here for what I've presented.  I just finished by asking you a question, sorry it's a bit of a roundabout the way, I did speak to someone who was on the board of Porsche AG in Germany, just for argument's sake, because I look to the north, northern Europe when I look to anything that's done well for anything really, and I do happen to know someone who knew someone, so I talked to that particular person, and that board sits under Volkswagen, a bigger group, and on that board, on that group, don't call it a board by the way,  They don't like the sound of the word bored. They think that detracts from what they do. They have representatives of the suppliers, the shop floor workers, the managers, the sales staff, the general public. So they have a community group that runs that company made up of all representative parties, and they all have an equal say. I'm trying to achieve that in this.",

    "text": " Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to present my submission today on Waipa District Council's representation review. Today my submission focuses on community boards, of which I do not support to be reinstated as part of this representation review. My submission is not based on personal opinions, interests, or spin. It is based on professional experience and the facts available.  So I believe you'll be presented with a well-balanced and fair perspective of why I believe WIPA is long overdue for a different representation model. So there are a few points I want to cover off. One, relevance. Two, purpose and linkages to outcomes. Three, layers of representation. Four, significance and engagement. And then I'll go into future options.  So let's start with some context and link that to relevance today. Community boards were created by LGNZ during the reform in 1989 out of concern that some of the amalgamated councils would be so large that former communities of interest might lose representation. Community boards were used to enable democratic local decision-making on behalf of communities. More than 30 years later, we're still using the same model.  Waipa is still relatively small in size and population compared to other districts and cities, yet everyone has equal opportunity to take part in local government decision-making in a way that best suits them. In 2021, to successfully engage with communities today, you must take a multi-channel approach to get cut through an increasingly more complex communication environment. This usually includes a mixture of things like media, owned channels, so that  Examples are your website, social media networks, newsletters, meetings, presentations and that sort of thing. And then paid media like digital and print advertising and campaigns. These are just a few examples and in Council's case, a community board meeting, community board is one piece of your complex engagement puzzle. However, when you weigh up community boards as a community engagement tool alongside other ways to engage, the people cost is high and they require significant supplementary resource to facilitate  at each meeting, for example, staff time, advertising, and so on. From my professional experience, community boards lack the level of influence today that they potentially had 10 years ago, let alone 30 years ago. And there is plenty of evidence available to show you that Waipou residents and ratepayers engage in local government decision-making using other techniques and approaches that are far less resource intensive.  So now I'd like to touch on the purpose of community boards. One of the key questions I wanted you to answer was, what do community boards do? You answered this on your website of 12 questions, that was number 10 on the list. Purpose was vaguely described and failed to connect to any robust way to performance measures or outcomes. Looking through the consultation information, you focus on numbers, boundaries, and names, but did not provide anything substantial on whether community boards are still relevant today  Do they empower community engagement? Are they making a difference in Waip\u0101? Are they achieving what Council set out for them to achieve? Are community boards meeting the ever more complex two-way communication needs of communities? And are community boards meeting residents' and ratepayers' expectations? Are they providing value for money?  What's concerning here is that in your latest resident survey, almost half of residents surveyed said they didn't know what community boards do. Timing wise, you probably had these results and there was an opportunity to address this when asking the community to have their say. Yet you skipped over this in your consultation with ads and social media posts prompting people to provide feedback on numbers and boundaries with no context or mention of what community boards do and why.  and what they achieve. Essentially, I would actually argue that this makes the quantitative data presented in the report in relation to the 49 submitters unusable because you haven't provided enough information to the public to give their feedback. I said in my written submission that because people don't know what communities  community boards do that I expected your response to this consultation process would be quite low and I was correct. The numbers actually do fail to provide a true reflection of what the community knows about community boards or thinks about community boards and without tangible substantial answers to the questions I've raised in my submission I can't see how you could hand on heart with confidence  say that community boards were a valuable asset to the Waipa community and that they should be reinstated for the next year's election. My third point was around layers of representation. In the consultation material, it states, quote, community boards are an additional layer of representation that support directly to council. And the key word here is layer, which in local government can often imply unnecessary complexity, inefficiency,  and sometimes a painful customer experience. If you did a stock take, you'd find that the responsibilities of community boards, as broadly set out in the legislation, are already carried out by the mayor, councillors, the council executive, and their staff. More specifically, you have made a significant investment into facilitating community engagement and consultation activities year on year that are carried out by permanent staff.  You have to, because it is a legislative requirement. You have a comms team, you have newly appointed community advisors working at the front line, grassroots level, to improve the linkages between council and communities. You have iwi advisors, and there are other stakeholder managers. There are many layers. The community board layer, from my perspective, is unnecessary. It is adding complexity, it is inefficient. And as one submitter pointed out,  the meetings are too formal and can be off-putting for members of the public anyway. Surely if a resident or ratepayer wants to discuss an idea, raise an issue or a concern, a direct line of communication to a councillor or a relevant council staff member would be their preferred option. It's certainly my preferred option and that's why I'm talking to you today.  So my fourth point was in relation to your Significance and Engagement Policy, which I did notice was not addressed in the report to the committee, and this may have been an oversight. Council's Significance and Engagement Policy was updated four months ago as part of the LTP, following consultation with the community. This policy outlines how Council will fulfil its legislative requirement to successfully engage and consult with the community under Section 5 of the Local Government Act 2002.  It also outlines the framework for how council will inform, consult, involve, collaborate with, and empower communities to take part in local government decision making. The policy makes absolutely no mention of using community boards as a mechanism to fulfill this legislative requirement.  Even if this was an oversight, you have to ask yourself why no one thought about community boards being at least mentioned in this framework. What the policy does demonstrate, however, is that today the community has never been more empowered to engage with council, and there are many different ways to do this.  So in my last point, in terms of future options and how you can attract and retain elected members, perhaps the real opportunity here is to tighten up the total number of elected members, i.e. remove community boards, which could help to attract a wider pool of candidates to council. And as a Cambridge resident, I would like to see a strong calibre of candidates to vote for, and there are potentially elected community board members who could represent my views at the council table.  I did notice that another submitter, who's just spoken, provided an alternative option. And it is clear that there are other ways of doing things that would achieve the right outcomes. Discretionary funding, for example, could be allocated by an existing council appointed funding committee to make this process a lot fairer and more transparent. I do have to note, too, that if your community board model was fit for purpose, you wouldn't be setting up a committee following the Streets for People trial  to represent the community's views on cycling in Cambridge. Again, added layers. So I'll leave it there. I sincerely hope this feedback is considered and it encourages some more vigorous debate around if the community board model of 1989 still meets the needs of our communities in 2021 and beyond. Thanks.",

From experience, the district promotion fund committee  is actually a really good model of pulling in independent people to allocate those discretionary funds in a fair way. And they do bring a local focus to that committee. So I think that's one example of how it does work. And I do have to commend the submitters too who spoke from the Porongia board side.  Again, it's another model that seems to work really well, and perhaps that is one way that you could look at getting that local community voice. But again, I mean, I wasn't part of any decision-making, of course, around the Streets for People Committee and what you've set out there, but perhaps, yeah, maybe take a step back and have a look at what community boards were providing that sort of led you to make the decision to pursue that as an option.

    "text": " Apologies for that. I'll start again. Good morning, everybody. So you've just finished hearing from the 10 people that wish to speak as part of the submission process, which we had open for over a month from the 27th of August to the 29th of September. We had 50 submissions this time, which was up from the 11 that we received last representation review.  So today in terms of the recommendation that you have in the report in front of you, it goes through the key aspects of the initial proposal and is really looking for direction from you on all of those issues as to whether you want to make any changes so then I can go away and prepare  the final proposal, which will be adopted at the end of the month at Council. So that'll be going through all those key points. So looking at the proposal to reduce the number of councillors down from 13 to 10, plus the one M\u0101ori wood councillor.  Combining the Pirongia and Kakapuku wards, the extension to the Maungatelturi ward, the minor changes to the urban boundaries, having a look at what you want to do in terms of the community boards,  and the changes to their boundaries and also looking at the names. So we'll need direction from you in terms of all of those key aspects of the proposal. So what I was proposing that  I do is we kind of go through each of them in turn. I'm happy to kind of give a brief introduction to the different points and the options that actually came out of the submissions that were received and then leave it for you to debate the issue. And if we just go through each of them in turn and then I can note down  as we go, kind of any changes that we might need to make to recommendations and bring that together and pass a recommendation at the end. So this will be, so we'll adopt, so if we can do that, we'll adopt the final proposal and just a point to note that there will be another  period where we will go out and issue another public notice after we adopt the final proposal at the end of October, and there will be a period for appeals and objections. So is everyone happy with that process? Joe, are we going through the late submission?  The late submission, what I have done is in terms of for each point, I have just got the numbers. And so in terms of my tally, in terms of numbers, I've added that to that. So I'll be able to update the tallies as we go through each item. And in terms of that late submission, they were talking, that was from the Chamber of Commerce. So they were really kind of about providing support to the  community board argument. So if you can factor that in when we get to that section, if that if that works for everybody. Oh yeah, all good.  Okay, so the first one we'll deal with was the reducing the number of councillors, so that had majority support from the submitters. So we had 28 submissions in support, that's the updated total, 11 against and nine neutral. You have heard quite a bit today from people in Pirongia talking about the importance of the structure, ensuring that we have  Adequate representation for the Prongia community. So out of really the written submissions that have come through, you end up with a number of options that are listed in the report to consider, which are alternatives to what's in the initial proposal.  You've got the option of retaining the 13 general ward councillors that you currently have. That would address the issues that some submitters have raised in terms of feeling that the drop down will be detrimental to the representation that is offered across the district.  it would also protect the Pronghia community in terms of enabling that Pronghia ward to remain standalone with two council representatives. So that would achieve that. It does mean that you get quite high numbers around the council table because there would be  13 general ward councillors plus your M\u0101ori ward councillor plus the mayor. So then you are getting up to 15 members around the council table. We did have some submitters that suggested that we should reduce the numbers down further. So one of the options that we had talked about before in the initial stages was dropping down to seven. So that option is featured in your report.  and that does meet the plus or minus 10% rule. It looks at a kind of combined rural ward. We did have another option that was presented in terms of having some councillors at large. This would enable, because what will happen in terms of those that are on the M\u0101ori role, they will be able to,  vote obviously for the M\u0101ori ward councillor, but they can only vote for in terms of other council representatives if they are at large. So there is a, that's why we've coming up, came up with that option, which is in the report for seven general ward councillors, plus one M\u0101ori ward councillor, plus two councillors elected at large.  And there is the other option to kind of add that at large to the 10 general ward councillors, which then again does put you back in the position where you end up with quite a lot of representatives around the council table. So essentially you've got the option to retain the initial proposal, look at kind of maybe status quo or looking at kind of whether you want to drop down further and look at any  permutations of having kind of at-large representation. Joe, just to interrupt for a second there, those at-large, that at-large option, it's noted that people on the M\u0101ori roll could vote for at-large.",

If we did this in three years' time, of course, it's quite resource intensive, one of these reviews, but if we were to do it in three years' time, we'd probably find, again, with the status quo, we'd be adding another counsellor.  into Cambridge in order to retain it. So in that sense, the status quo, the 13 of you would then, plus the Maori ward candidate, would become 14. So that might not be very sustainable. We'd be having similar problems, I think, if we drop down to the seven general ward councillors.

The only lack of or potential lack of representation by amalgamating those two wards could come from  actually the Kakapuku side on account of the fact that Kakapuku is less populated and you could potentially have a Perongia township or village that could dominate there. But look, that's a risk we just have to take. This is the way the numbers stack up. I don't sense that the interests and values of the Kakapuku water are particularly different from Perongia and Hopo and all those other areas encompassing in the area.  I don't have a difficulty with it, but I certainly am mindful of the reservations raised by those Pirongi residents, but I feel comfortable with the amalgamation of the two.",

It's a really long drive. It's difficult to make that connection. I think we've talked about the value of people being in a relationship with each other, you know, that creates a sense of connection and community in that. And I just feel it's going to be really hard to make it work here.  while I accept the reasons why the amalgamation is being proposed. And so the outcome of, you know, is this large award.

And I'm just really conscious that council is not very clear on what community boards do. I think we have been really poorly served by the communication feedback loops. And I'm conscious of the fact that Charlotte, who was the communications manager, is saying that,  that there's really not enough, I suppose, evidence of what community boards are doing and that. But in actual fact, I was really surprised about that, because I would actually see council, like comms, having a particular role of getting out to the community what community boards are doing and inviting people through their networks, you know, to be participating in community board  initiatives, events, feedback, consultations, because I don't think council staff have seen community boards as the vehicle by which they should be doing their consultation through. As an example, I had a look on the Facebook page  Waipa District Council and while they promote various initiatives within the community, not once do they say that the community board would be a way for you to make your views known. Like  and then we don't get a feedback loop from the community board to the council. So I'm not surprised that we don't think they do anything and that the community doesn't know what they do either. So there was, I would hope that coming out of this, that we, I'd like to see that the majority rules, which is that we retain the community boards, but I'd like to see some sort of initiative set up so that we can improve  the effectiveness and also the visibility. Yeah, just the way that operates. I mean, when we did the future of local government workshops and we had Peter McKinley come and talking to us, one of the things he emphasised was that for a resilient community, they really want to make decisions with people they are in relationship with. That's the people they see in the street that they know, the decision makers and things like that.  And that, to me, really speaks strongly to community boards. So that's my piece.

Yeah, hey, a bit like Roger, I support the community boards, but we've heard some good speakers, and I guess we've seen the community boards and how they've operated over the years that we've lived in Waipa. And one of the things I've picked up from Sue is, and whether her numbers were accurate, and Graham might be to help us out here, actually, or Elwyn, but one to two people turn up for the public forum,  Now, in years gone past, I think many, many more people have turned up to the public forum. So I guess it's about  being visual and what we can do there. But it really comes down to not picking up individual things. But I really do honestly believe there needs to be a review of the function of the community boards and what we actually want them to deliver. Because all we're doing to me is stumbling from triennial election to triennial election. And if we're going anywhere, we're lucky to be treating water.  You know, I think we're going backwards, if we're being honest, in terms of what the function of the community board is to the community.  So it's around the relevance and the why they exist, I think, is what people want to know and what ratepayers want to know. So I don't think we should be axing them, but I do not think they should be carrying on in their current state. I really think we need an honest review, right in the middle of it, in some community in this too, and spend some time between now and the next election.

And to that extent, I would say that we are looking at things like, let's just take the community Christmas parade, for example, and these sort of events that they facilitate that sort of thing, rather than just throwing it out to groups, trying to get people involved and get the community involved. I just feel very strongly at the moment  We've lost this link between the two. I think as a councillor, we're quite removed from our community. We are here to represent Waipa. And I see that as a barrier in some ways for just representing your own town. And that is a link that we have to still have people that will represent our little local community. I always believe in bottom-up, strong local communities facilitating what they want in their local area.  and we lose it. And unfortunately, that's happening quite a lot at the moment.

Look, I've written screeds and screeds and screeds, as I'm sure you probably would have expected me to have, but I guess what I'm hearing from everybody is a bit of a shift in terms of accepting that the current structure we have isn't working, and perhaps an appetite to review it so that it does work better for our communities. I don't think anybody here would support the abolition of community boards end of and just have  the council. I don't think that's anything anybody wants. I accept that there is a need for that second layer for one of a better description. But it's a case of what that second layer looks like. And I think Mike's probably encapsulated it pretty well. We need to do a lot of work to find out what that layer looks like and how that will best bring out those unique voices of the communities that we have in specific communities of interest. My preference, I guess, going forward would be to actually  remove the structures of the community boards and do the work leading up to the next election as to what their replacement would look like. And I hear there's some reservation around our table about, and from some submitters about, leaving it up to the kindness of the incoming mayor and elected members to actually fulfill the vision, potentially what we may have now. But I would go out on a limb to say that  I think we would ignore that or that group of people would ignore that at their peril. I don't think that there is a single person in this district that puts their hand up for a local government representation in any way, shape or form that would want to just decrease the democratic engagement that our community have with our decision makers. So I don't for a minute think that any incoming council would refuse to  and bring in a replacement body for those community boards. So that doesn't hold any weight for me. I mean, we could sit here and talk about the numbers and the sample sizes and the increasing dissatisfaction in our resident surveys and what have you going forward. But I just think we need to honestly think about how we are going to make changes, because I think if we just say, yes, we'll renew the  the existence of community boards as they currently stand, and then we'll get some reports done, and then they'll probably sit in a pile and they'll never get acted. I think if we remove them now, the onus is on us to actually provide our communities with a structure, proposed structure that will work better than what it is working now. So I guess that's really all I've got. So much other stuff there, but my sense is that people have actually seen the shortcomings that exist in the current situation.  From a personal perspective, I do feel that there has been some criticism lodged towards councillors that sit on those community boards and the roles they play. I think it's a little unkind to lay all that blame at the feet of those councillors, because I think we've done a lot of really good work for those community boards over the years that we've all been on them. And in terms of the failure to report back to council  I recall that matter was actually put to council some time ago and we all voted to no longer hear from them. So it was actually this membership that decided we didn't need to hear from them. And the other thing was that I don't believe this is a comms issue. This is actually a structural issue. And is our current structure fit for purpose for 2021 going forward as opposed to historical  creation of 1989, which is obviously some time ago. I was leaving high school at that year. So that gives you some idea of how old the current structure is. So anyway, I'll just leave my comments there. So I would be, should we put these up separately, which I think we probably should, I will be voting  against the proposal insofar as it relates to the community board retention issue, in the hopes that we might be able to make something better and put the acid on ourselves as an organisation to provide that to our communities.",

And I suppose looking not only with ours, but across the country, and the criticism that's made is that some councils give them more responsibility than others.  from a statutory point of view, they have fairly fixed terms of reference, and they can really do what they determine in that in terms of holding council to account. But it's those community type activities that they organise that are so, I suppose, valued by the community. And that can be done by other than a statutory community board.  So, on just one question I had for Graham, probably in terms of making the decision today, if we decide to do away with the community boards, is there any way of giving some  I suppose, confidence that there will be something to replace it, or are we basically going to say we'll work on that after the next election? Because I think if we just make that resolution today, then there's probably no way back from it.",

Yeah, and I guess that would be directing staff  to review and report back in regard to the appropriate purpose of community boards going forward and, I guess, to strengthen the role of those boards going forward. Now, of course, that would be a significant piece of work for council staff to do. But, yeah, but I think that keeps faith with the discussion today. So, yeah, so I think no matter what the outcome,  you know, today in terms of whether community boards stay or whether they go, yeah, I would suggest some significant work on staff between now and the next election or September or whatever date you just said, Joe, yeah, in regard to, yeah, short-shoring up, yeah, a better, yeah, a better local form of community representation going forward.

And I'm also very mindful that a lot of the feedback we got through the submission process, while it wasn't specifically saying yay or nay for community boards, but there's quite a strong message that  elected representatives were much more favoured than appointees made by council through whatever process. And so I'm a bit surprised that we seem to have moved from acknowledging that the performance of community boards could be improved and that we'd be really supportive of a process to work on how that might look to saying, well, then we should just do away with them completely and look at  a completely fresh thing. So yeah, I'm supportive of doing a review and actually working with people that are on community boards, finding out how we could help them to structure things so that they can do more of what they think they should be doing as well. I'm not convinced by an argument that it's 30 years old, so it has to change. I mean, councils are also 30 years old. There's a lot of other institutions that are a lot older than 30 years.  but they still function well. So I'm more in the camp that it's perhaps that it's not being given attention to that there did need to be a way to structure things in a soft sense, so not the numbers and the board itself, but yeah, just giving them better support and understanding, you know, what mission they're on and to make sure that they can deliver it.",
