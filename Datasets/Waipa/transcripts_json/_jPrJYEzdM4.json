    "text": " OK, well, yeah, it is good afternoon everybody. And so this is a workshop in relation to the resource management system. So as you probably recall, in February 2021, the government announced it will reform the resource management system by replacing the RMA with three new acts, Natural and Built Environment Act, Strategic Planning Act and Climate Adaptation Act. So this is the RMA system reform process in terms of the whole three aspects.  And just to recap the objectives, so the objectives of the RMA reform is to move from effects-based systems to an outcome-based one, simplify and standardize the process and make them less costly, provide for more effective and consistent national direction, substantially reduce the number of local government RMA plans, reduce the need for consenting while ensuring environmental safeguards are still in place,  So as part of the targeted consultation engagement process by government, they released this discussion document where pre-circulated the information. So our future resource management system is what it's called. It's targeted engagement with a number of stakeholders, including local government. So they wanted feedback in relation to that discussion document. And the team, including Joe, Tony,  who can't be with us today. We'll take you through a presentation, and the draft response document has been pre-circulated, so we're after some feedback. So perhaps without any further ado, I'll just pass it on to Jo and take us through the presentation. So thanks, Jo. Thanks, Wayne.",

    "text": "Kia ora koutou.  This is basically our response to this discussion document. We're looking for your feedback on the main elements of the draft submission. The draft submission has been done at a very high level, and that is due to a huge lack of information about  what the various acts are going to contain, what they're going to look like. So MFE released a discussion document at the end of November 21. Each section of the document contained a number of questions that they were seeking feedback from, from local authorities, and it was on all aspects of a new resource management system. The feedback is due with MFE next week on the 28th of February.  As Wayne has previously said, we established a staff working group. We have also been talking to other Waikato councils, including Hamilton City and Waikato District. Staff fed back to David Topman, who collated all the information he received and the draft submission document that hopefully you have been sent. So at a very high level,  Our draft submission contains and raises concern over the lack of certainty of many aspects of the new resource management system. One of those being the national planning framework which is going to heavily influence what regional planning documents are going to look like and essentially we know nothing about what that's going to include, what it's not going to include.  The Ministry for Environment has indicated that they are still expecting the draft Natural and Built Environment Bill and the Strategic Planning Bill to be introduced to Parliament by the end of this year. Last time I was talking to the Ministry, they indicated somewhere between October to early December. We have put in our submission  and recommended that there be another opportunity for local government to input into the two bills before they go to a first reading in Parliament. We, throughout a submission, have indicated that local government plays a critical role in implementing the new resource management system. We've also noted several times the timing of implementation in 2023 of the new resource management system comes ahead of local government reform.  We have asked that any transitional arrangement ahead of the local government reform should not add additional costs and resource burdens for local government. So when the resource management came in, a transitional period was given for councils to transfer over from the Old Town and Country Planning Act to the Resource Management Act. We are expecting that there'll be a similar transitional arrangement so that councils can transfer from the Resource Management Act way of working  to the new resource management system way of working. We have put in our submission that central government needs to provide support to local government, iwi and mana whenua through the transitional implementation stages. We have indicated to central government that both local government and iwi will need help to build  capacity and capability in the new areas of the resource management system that are being introduced and that potentially some of this will be via funding or other support such as training. One aspect we have indicated is that it would be good to have a greater certainty about the future of local government  So once we had that, that would resolve a lot of the governance aspects of the new resource management system. So the new resource management system proposes a joint committee made up of representatives of each district council or each council within a region. You've got a common secretariat. All of these need to be resourced. All of these need to have people on board. No indication has been given as to  their makeup, how people get elected to these bodies, is one council going to have a more dominant position over other councils, so it's very uncertain. And when you link that to the local government reforms, which again is uncertain, there's just this big absence of information that we're trying to get resolved. So essentially,  I would welcome your questions and comments. I would welcome those by the end of play this Thursday, which is the 24th of February, and that would give me Friday morning to incorporate those into the draft submission. The draft submission would then go to Kirsty Downley for her review as a strategy manager, and we would be aiming to get this to Gary on Monday, the 28th of February, for his sign-off.  and for it to be sent. We are looking to report back to the elected members at the council meeting on the 29th of March. So that's a very high level overview of what we are planning to do. The submission itself, you will see that we have divided it into three parts. So we have a general introduction, we've got  Part two, which is overall comments, and that highlights the main points we have made throughout the submission document. And then when you move to part three, that's essentially the table and the headings are the headings that were used in the discussion document, and we've just made comments under each of those. So I'm really happy to take questions and would welcome your feedback and your input into the draft submission.  so we can finalize it and get it sent.",

I had put my hand up, but yeah, just before people kick off, I think you've hit on a really important point here and that in the absolute absence and vacuum of information at any sort of detailed level,  that every angle, LGNZ and councils in between pushing for the opportunity for the second bite of the cherry in terms of giving feedback. So holding off for that first reading, as long as possible, if that's an option, but it just seems that we're trying to get feedback on something that we don't really know a hell of a lot about.  You know, if I liken it back to World War II, the Germans invaded Russia with very little information and it didn't go well for them. And I'd hate, you know, to use the same analogy, but trying to go into something like this with really eyes wide, you know, I mean, just with little information is not wise. So I think trying to let government give councillors another bite of a cherry absolutely makes sense.",

We've done our best to pull together a submission on the information we have.

So I know their timeframes are really tight where they're trying to get it.  before Parliament by the end of the year, but I think they would get good value in councils having input into an exposure bill and provide feedback on that before it actually is introduced as first reading.

    "text": " Thanks, Wayne. I think I put my hand up after Andrew and Claire, but that's probably a benefit of being the mayor, I suppose. Hey, listen, absolutely concur with your comments. I think the only submission we can make has got to be a fairly general one, but just raising the issues that we just don't have the information.  one of the issues really is with these joint committees, my understanding at the moment, the proposition is that it's made up of one representative from each council on the joint committee that set the new plans in place. And I just  given any thought at all as to who's actually going to be accountable for the for the delivery or the implementation of these plans? Because if you've councils,  effectively are accountable to their communities and pay for any mistakes in the election cycle every three years. But how can one representative, and if there's 13 councils in the Waikato region,  How can Waip\u0101, for argument's sake, be held accountable for decisions that is made by a collective group that are not elected by our ratepayers? So it's that accountability and who is going to be responsible for implementing this plan when it's put in place, because there could be significant costs associated with  whatever that regional committee comes up with that are completely opposed to what our community want or any other community within the region. So it's that accountability issue that I think is really important and missing.  and no discussion at all on the benefit costs of the changes that they're talking about. So just what is it actually going to cost the community to do this? And what are the benefits that we're gaining? And I suppose I'm a little bit concerned that there's going to be no notice taken will be delivered up with a  dictate from on high and be left trying to sort out the mess for our community and planning the future, I suppose, for our communities. So that's a general comment. I think we've got to keep it open, just raise the issues and say we want more time and we want to have more input.",

I see that we are looking at suggesting establishment of district advisory panels to help inform a joint committee so that the local requirements are reflected in any regionalised one plan. But yes, certainly in terms of the delivery side of things,  I haven't seen any information come through about how that will work amongst all the territorial authorities and implementing a combined regional plan. And it's going to take some good regional or good leadership throughout the region to work through some of those details in terms of how it will be implemented. Suffice to say, presumably, you know, the comments that have been made about regional implementation  across regulatory services. This might be another example of where it could end up if we don't hold a position in regard to local delivery. And costs, yeah, in terms of preparing a document, the proportional costs of a territorial authority across the region, who pays for what and preparing documents and implementation, absolutely another detail that needs to be worked through. I'm not sure if Tony or Jo have any further commentary on those points.",

So our thinking is that if this progresses as anticipated, we wouldn't do a full plan review. We'd simply take that funding that's already in the LTP and transfer that into the effort for the new regional plan. We did look at the costing when this first came out.  And our very early thinking was that we thought we could accommodate it within our existing budget. So, we haven't actually asked for any more in the LTP. We're in a good position time wise and a lot of the other councils aren't. So, Waikato District, for example, they just finished their plan review, so they have to do it all again.

So when we look across the regulatory system,  You know, it does seem to be very stigmatised in terms of individual government departments looking at particular aspects of regulatory, but in terms of a coordination across local government, yes, I absolutely concur.

    "text": "Yeah, yeah, thanks Wayne. And yeah, I agree with everything that's been said so far. In fact, I don't have any confidence at all with the architects of this reform and how it's being implemented because of the sheer lack of information, as you've already touched on. There's just not enough at all to go on to understand how it would work to give any meaningful comment.  I totally agree with your request that you get another bite of the cherry, you know, to get another input once there's more, you know, another, yeah, exposure draft available. But I understood that that was the purpose of having the previous exposure draft. The crux for me is how conflicts are resolved. So, you know, obviously there's an intent to provide greater national direction.  but also allow local input. And so without the detail on how those various, I don't know, any particular proposal, you'd weigh up the various aspects within that. I'm really worried that the national direction will remove any discretion. There's been a bit of case law about that recently, but I do think that  that each proposal should be able to be evaluated at a local level and not be completely determined by national policy statements and regional policy statements. Yeah, so that's leading to these joint committees and district advisory committees, because my experience on hearing panels is the proposals themselves  you do have to take the local impacts really, like that's most of the deliberation stuff that you do. And so if you've got a district advisory committee that's gonna have input into a particular decision, I just think the scale is too large and  Yeah, yeah, so I'm not really comfortable about what's being proposed there. But something that doesn't seem to be talked about much, and it's to do with the drive for reducing costs, is a natural sort of way of handling that is to allow more permitted activities. And there's no mention about that, you know. And so what would become,  at the moment, an activity that we probably need a resource consent for that would now, that in the new system would be, you know, permitted, you know, like how scary would that be for our, certainly our residential areas, possibly our commercial areas too, you know,  I mentioned I've been, I read a book called Strong Towns, which is based in the US, but they're saying that the regulatory system should have as permitted activities, what they call thickening. Yeah, so thickening of activity. So there's not much change between what's being proposed and your neighbors. So that would be permitted, but anything that would be, you know, quite a step up from that thickening would need  a resource consent still or a process where people have input into it. Because we do know that it's a massive effort to get some proposals over the line and that the cost and the consultants and the expert evidence and all that that's needed is definitely prohibitive. But we can't have a system that's going to be solely looking after that kind of class of activity.  Most of our resource consent stuff is sort of run of the mill. It's small scale stuff. It's people wanting to do improvements in their own backyard and things. And I don't want that to be lost in this review either.",

And, you know, the recent example about the Housing, Enabling and Supply Act, it just really didn't fit with all councils. And I guess that's the concern of national direction being imposed on local councils. You know, it doesn't have that local input.  Yeah, I certainly understand when you say removing discretion at a local level. We certainly got to be careful about how this bill is framed in that regard. And anything, if we do have a more simplified consenting system, we need to be able to ensure that environmental safeguards are still in place.  Tony, Joe, have any observations on Clare's comments?

So one model that did come to mind was the Hauraki Gulf Marine Spatial Plan, where the analogy here that we've got is we've got an all-over region committee, joint committee. So they make the decisions, they make the plans,  What we thought is that\u2014 and picking up on the Mayor's comment\u2014 that needs a strong degree of local content. And so the thinking there was we'd set up something like the SPMP existing\u2014 how that function's existing already. So it could be our SPMP, but for the purposes of the submission, we called it Interstitial Advisory Committee. So that would be the engine room of our policy generation within each of the district councils. So we've already got that committee structure set up.  that would then provide recommendations through to the all of region joint committee. And what we're suggesting is that there'd be a degree of compulsion in those recommendations coming through so that joint committee would be compelled to accept the recommendation of the equivalent SPMP, unless it was a good reason to depart from it. So we think that's a model where it could provide a strong degree of local democracy coming through and picking up the mayor's  thinking around, yeah, only one representative that gives that person, I suppose, a mandate from that district they're representing that they've got that collaborative process behind them to make those decisions. So that was the thinking behind that.",

The document was very good.  but I really had my concern with the statement of community outlooks and how they are aligned and put in place with the regional strategic plan and how they actually work. And the other thing that worried me too was that the smaller territorial authorities don't necessarily have any representation on the joint committee. So we've got a situation here where they are actually embargoed or removed from that discussion in the original  discussions, documents I've seen. The second thing is that the majority of the decision-making process will go to independent commissioners. So we do not make the actual decisions at a local level. It seems to me to go directly to independent commissioners outside the jurisdiction of our local authorities. And this means that local decision-making processes, as Claire rightly said, is removed from our local territory authorities. So I think that  There's some very, very big question marks here. And as I say, I sit, as you well know, on a joint committee, and you're only one voice for a whole area.

And what we don't know, and one of the fundamental questions around governance decisions, is whether that joint committee that's proposed here is a representative committee or whether it's kind of a skilled-based committee. So there's two models here. Government hasn't given us any direction around that. So if it's a representative committee, then it makes it really difficult for each of the councils and the iwi sitting around the table to be at that table making a decision based on their constituents' desires.  Another model that could be put forward would be sort of a skill-based model, where you wouldn't have people sitting there as representatives, but you'd have them there based on their knowledge and their mana, I suppose, to make decisions. And they'd be appointed or put forward, and they'd be people of, I guess, standing in the community who you'd have a strong level of confidence to make those skill-based decisions. Government hasn't signalled which of those two governance models they are looking at, and certainly the representative one  carries quite a lot of challenges around how that might work.",

So that's a real concern, I think, that in terms of a democracy, we're just going to be ruled by appointed bodies, whether it's commissioners or somebody appointed from the community.  And some of the feedback I've been getting is that the regional committees, no decision has been made yet, but the comments are that it could be either or, either an elected member or somebody with some technical knowledge that's acceptable to the community.
