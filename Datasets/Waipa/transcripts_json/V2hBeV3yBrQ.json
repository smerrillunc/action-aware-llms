But anyway, yeah, very warm welcome. Hopefully we're not on Zoom for too much longer. We're heading in the right direction anyway. So to start the meeting off, do we have any apologies? I think we're all here.  Present, incorrect. So there's no apologies. Are there any disclosures? Item two, any disclosures of members' interests? No, there are none. Any late items? Item three. No, no late items.  So the confirmation of the order of the meeting, I haven't received anything to say we need to change that. So I'm assuming we'll go as it's in the agenda. I can move, Jim. Moved Councillor O'Regan, Susan and Andrew Brown. All those in favour? Aye.",

Obviously, all meetings were attended virtually,  But during September, over the last month, along with probably Liz and Roger, attended the regional connections meeting with the regional council. There was a CCTV meeting as well. There was a spokesperson from Auckland that joined us. And that was actually really positive, actually. It seems like our technology is up to speed. It just needs to be set up properly.  So that was quite encouraging. There was a national eyesight AGM, which was pretty straightforward. And then again, with Liz and Roger, there's been a wellbeing or welfare virtual group working, you know, just on during lockdown to make sure that the Cambridge Community House and everybody homeless or in need or  just whatever issues there are around Cambridge and Pacific were looked after. Also with people, elderly people that don't have family around them. So to make sure that they weren't missing out, I did a few home deliveries for people there like I did last year. It wasn't nearly the same demand as last year. Last year was really busy, but this year wasn't so bad.  And then we've had the Christmas Parade meeting, so that's on the 5th of December. We're going to invite the Olympians along to that, make it a sporty one, Christmas Parade, so that'll be really exciting. It is the Hamilton Christmas Parade on the same day, but we've got the Olympians, so that'll be a big drawcard. So, yep, that was it from me, thank you.",

Our community safety officer, Maddie Merson, has been very busy in the community.  There's been some positive moves towards the CCTV. That's encouraging, more encouraging for a long time. And there's going to be a meeting in the future with the Cambridge Safer Community Trust. So hopefully we can get together as a team in the very near future, who knows. Interesting with COVID, our patrolling hours in August 2020 were 612 as compared with this year, which dropped to 21 hours. So that's a big difference  people being able to get out in the community. And last night, Claire and I had the honour of going to the Coromateur Hall AGM, which is the furthest north we attend. It's quite a trek into that sun. There was an amazing sunset last night and I was going straight into it, but that was good. They're a very active community for a small hall. It's immaculate. And I was talking to one of the attendees last night, and if any of us can get to 90 next February, this guy is, I've got to just keep  doing what we're doing. It was amazing to see some of these older people that are so active. But yeah, two meetings, good meetings. So thank you.",

And it does seem there's some hope  get a better quality system going for Cambridge which will be great. Another thing yesterday I attended that global walk for the elderly at the Raceway which was also supported by Tim up from, he's in charge of a gold card up from Wellington and also Harriet came from the Cambridge Community House.  The Rotary supported it with their band and there was probably, I'm guessing, probably about 70 people there. We took some from school and grandparents and it's hard to sort of, how many you take, not to go over the hundreds, so it was quite a balancing act.  about the direction of three waters that's out there in the public at present. And I think we, on the side of the swamp, have a meeting this afternoon just to have a discussion around that with a few councillors.",

    "text": "Yeah thanks Jim. Hey yeah so just a few things. So first of all yeah the CCTV which I'm chairing at the moment and as everyone has said it's going in the right direction but what's really  important now is we get a really good result for our town. So we're going to keep having those meetings. And just to say that the staff have been extremely supportive in trying to find a solution and get this on track. So yeah, thanks very much to Brian in particular. The ongoing wealthier checks that have been mentioned as well. Yeah, I think we're probably going to be sort of refocusing our attentions more around the business community. I think this is where we've been hit hardest this time round.  and again, mostly the hospitality in Waip\u0101, but we'll, yeah, hopefully be able to lessen those meeting times and things soon. Hey, just the Regional Connections meeting, which is led by Regional Council and chaired by Angela Strange, we had an excellent meeting, Zoom meeting, just a couple of, a week or so ago, and there was, I guess, a bit of a breakthrough for Waip\u0101. So the first item on the agenda, which was a recommendation  I guess, to improving bus services between Hamilton and Cambridge. And that recommendation was approved. And what we do now is we put, I guess, staff, the regional council, in conjunction with WIPA staff, we'll be looking at a joint route study, which will act as a roadmap, I suppose, to improve public transport between the city and Cambridge.  So really pleasing to have that as a formal recommendation. So I understand we will start to see some of the, I guess, further data and further reporting on that this side of Christmas as well. So what we have seen is even though there's limitations with that route at the moment, I mean, you can still get to, I guess, back to Cambridge or to Hamilton faster in a car than on a bus, but what it does show is that patronage has been steadily increasing,  our public want it, so what we want to do now is just provide, I suppose, more options and certainly more flexibility around that.  Yeah, that's a real breakthrough for Cambridge around the public transport. And just lastly on the event, just sort of touch on event cancellations and what's kind of happening in the world of events in Waipa, which a lot of our hospitality do kind of focus on and rely on. It's looking a little grim this side of Christmas. I even have events now that are cancelled for February of next year. And some might question, well, why so far out?  It's the marketing and the planning that, you know, is really difficult for volunteers who are running their events. So, you know, marketing budgets can sometimes be up to, you know, $60,000, $70,000, even just for a smaller event. So if you have to commit a month or two or three prior,  course, it's a bit off-putting to, you know, to assist some of those events that, you know, kind of rely on tickets and things for their income, with no certainty that the event can even go ahead. So that's just some of the backgrounds to why we're seeing, you know, just so many cancellations, I suppose, compared to last time. And of course, the other focus is that we are going into summer, our main event season. And of course, you know, with that uncertainty, it's just simply  it's not viable for a lot of organisations. And Clare, I was really saddened to see that the Porongia craft fair was cancelled. I mean, these are the sorts of events that just really disheartening, but completely understand the circumstances and that's just where we are at at the moment. Thanks everyone.",

    "text": " Good morning, everybody. Just want to do a quick update in terms of the Te Muru Community Board. Lou and I attended two rather gruelling, lengthy Te Muru Community Board meetings to deal with the discretionary funding round. I'm not sure if many of you are aware, but the funding allocation has changed in terms of the mechanism. We have two rounds now rather than the one in order to help us sort of balance out and make a fairer,  availability of that fund, still the same amount, but it's divided across two funding rounds. I think we allocated somewhere in the region of about 27 or so thousand odd, that's Lush nodding his head, so yes, that's about right, so community groups in our area. We were really oversubscribed a huge amount more than we've ever had before, certainly in my experience on that board. So it was a pretty,  Yeah, we, I think, had to make some pretty tricky decisions and unfortunately had to refuse a fair number that perhaps in the past we've been willing and keen to support. So the other news that came from those meetings was that a motion was put and carried to express the Te Aumotu Community Board's strenuous opposition to the Three Waters reform. And Lou and I just talked at length with them about what our experience has been so far in terms of  The information we'd been provided, potentially some of the gaps in that knowledge, and they unanimously agreed to support that motion put by board member Darbyshire to oppose or express their opposition to that reform.

But as I said earlier, people only have to look at me and they think about mental health all the time.  I haven't been to very many things either, but I did go along with Bruce to the Coromantua Hall Association AGM last night and just back up everything he said. It's a fantastic group of people that are looking after that hall and that community. And they're just so dedicated and really up with a lot of the stuff that we're doing here at council. Like they had a talk about the representation review and they did certainly want, they actually get quite a good coverage because we also have  a Waikato district councillor attend as well. And we got to hear about their representation review as well, and some of their initiatives too, to make sure that communities are having more of a say and getting what they want from council. And Liz, you mentioned the Pirongi Craft Day being cancelled in a year. It is quite a blow for the community. It's a massive event actually, and just for one day, but obviously just can't go ahead  you know, under COVID conditions. And yeah, I really feel for the people who've put so much time and energy into preparing for it and then it's going to come to nothing. We had the Pirongi Award Committee meeting as well. Like Susan, I'm touching on that because you mentioned about the discretionary grants and we also do discretionary grants and honestly, yeah, very much oversubscribed and a real challenge to  respond to those requests and give a meaningful grant in support of the work that all of them are really highly worthy of supporting. There was an issue raised by one of the members that there's, for \u014chopu, that there is a pedestrian crossing planned there. And we know that it's the design works going ahead with Waka Kotahi.  However, it wasn't even mentioned in the papers. I had a complaint from the Ohaup\u014d member, and I did actually check whether or not there was any mention, and there wasn't anything. And as he rightly claimed, why are we getting reports from staff on transportation, for instance, and yet it's not even mentioned there, and yet it's something that's highly relevant for our community.  And I do have to question, you know, why those things aren't coming to like the Pirongi Award Committee so that those representatives of those communities are able to be informed, but also give feedback and then be well prepared to then go back to their communities and get the word out and make sure that these initiatives are going to get the buy-in, you know, and the involvement that we want. We want our community to know about  the pedestrian crossing and we want them to be able to see the design and maybe have some input into it. And I think that's the whole point of having the Pirongi Award Committee. So I just wanted to stress that really. Thanks.",

But what our community hasn't had the opportunity to do is have some input into where it could go.

The other thing was they had a discussion on the Ratatouille Reserve. There's a little bit of an extra discussion on that.

Go back to where I wanted to be. Unfortunately, like everyone, we've had a major reunion actually cancel on us. We were having that in Te Amuri, hosted by the RSA.  with over 200 persons arriving. Unfortunately, it's gone because of COVID. We've had to reschedule ANZAC Armistice Day. We're now talking of Armistice Day on the 14th, Sunday, the 14th of November, not the 11th. Now, the reason for that is that, unfortunately, our head office is having a major conference down in Wellington, where we've all got to attend. So, unfortunately, we're going to have our Armistice Day on a Sunday.  Hopefully it'll work well for us, and it doesn't actually align. We actually made sure it doesn't combine or confer against Cambridge, so one week afterwards. And the final thing I'd like to say is we had a meeting with urban miners, and our e-waste collection is going ahead on Sunday at the Te Amuru Sports Car Park for anybody that has got some e-waste. So we start at 9 a.m. in the morning, finish at 11 a.m.  and invite people that have got e-waste to come along. We'll be collecting at that time and operating as normal. And we're troking, with the meeting, we actually have organised that we're going to have a regular monthly collections, both in Cambridge and in Te Amuri. So that's all been organised.",

And I got the idea that that was going to be over a reasonably small time frame. So really, we should get something out there. Liz, I think by the end of the year, was it not?  So that's really positive. Certainly the Cambridge Health and Wellness Zoom meetings that we've been having have been really good to keep up with how the different areas of our community are handling the lockdown.  I attended by zoom again the streets for people review, which really pleased with the outcome of that and particularly, as we saw in last week's meeting, the urban mobility to committees that were that have been set up, which is really good going forward.  Again, joining with Mike on tonight's meeting for Three Waters. I think at this stage as well, just to mention the AGM of the Cambridge Heritage Charity Trust, which Mike and I joined, and I think we've had a notification that's gone out about the unfortunate  the decision to wind up that trust, which is a bit unfortunate, but that was a decision that had to be made.

There is a bit of a timing issue in terms of the agency sign-off and then us allowing us to move forward. So  So whilst it looks that we are producing something that's quite well developed, we're now moving into that phase of getting community feedback and we'll certainly engage with the various parties.

    "text": "All right. OK. All right. Hey, well, thank you for that. Look, from my perspective, from the Zoom meetings, I've been trying to keep away from any  public gatherings that might risk breaching the lockdown measures. Those that don't really want to get  media coverage, buying an ice cream without a mask on, or going for a paddle in the ocean. But I think it behoves us all just to be careful and probably set as good an example as we can, because we've really got to get on top of COVID if we want the country to get back  moving again. So anything we can do to promote vaccination so that we don't have to go into lockdown is a really good step forward, I think. So, and hopefully if we can get that done before Christmas, some of those events over the summer might still be able to go ahead. Look, my time's been pretty well tied up with the Three Waters reform. We're going to have that discussion later on. But just quickly, the  the meeting that Dawn and I attended in Taupo last week, I think it was, with the 22 other councils in the Entity B area. It was, I suppose, a day's discussion on how to communicate back to central government without actually making a commitment or actually saying anything. But it was clear that  majority of councils still have major issues with the reform as it's being proposed. But there's differing opinions, so how we're going to get a collective view from those 22, let alone across the country, is going to be a real challenge, I think. But look, we'll have that discussion later on. Dawn, I don't know whether you wanted to add anything on the meeting in Taupo?  No. So it was certainly worthwhile going. Everybody was approaching it from a positive perspective in terms of wanting to improve our water supplies and the environmental outcomes with sewage and stormwater. But I'd have to say there was probably an overwhelming lack of support for the proposition being put forward by central government. So, yeah.  more vehemently opposed than others. But anyway, so look, if there's no other comments on that item, we're on to item six now, which is the confirmation of the minutes of the 31st of August. And can I have a mover and a seconder to receive those? Philip and Roger, all those in favour? Aye. Contrary.  Carried. So just going through those minutes, were there any, if we go through them, page two or 14, there's nothing on the first page. Three, four, five, six, anyone? Seven.",

One thing that was a key point of discussion was out of the arc survey, how we engage with all of council about these meetings.  And you'll see there were a lot of appendices included this time. So the appendix two is the top risks. That's after our annual refresh. So those are the 14 top risks that will prevent us achieving our objectives. Appendix three is risk appetite statement. Now that is portfolio based and we have added the portfolio for fraud and bribery and corruption.  as suggested by our internal auditors after the last audit. And that appetite statement has also been refreshed. And appendix four is the quarterly risk report. Now that's a key discussion document at audit and risk. And it also includes compliance information by exception.  is worthwhile reading. And then finally, Appendix 6 is the survey results. They show a consolidation and were generally positive. But as I said earlier, there was discussion about engaging all of Council.

Hey, so, yeah, so Graham, we did, yeah, while I don't think there was any actual questions on that matter, yeah, certainly there was a bit of discussion.  And I spent quite a bit of time at the meeting, actually taking the meeting through what the drivers of those increases were, because at face value, two sets of 9% increases year-on-year is pretty alarming.  But look, the context for that is the Auditor-General. So actually the Auditor-General, rather than Audit New Zealand, has been saying for a couple of years that he is concerned that the audit fees that are set up within the local government sector, and I think some of the other public  public type sector, you know, sectors in New Zealand. Yeah, those audit fees are not recovering the true costs of the audit. So we have had John Ryan, the Auditor General, saying that for a couple of years. Audit New Zealand as well, when you think about it, I mean, essentially what they are is a professional services firm. So their core cost is in their staffing.  And look, they are really, really under pressure in their staffing at the moment. So, historically, they've relied on importing in young professionals from England and South Africa and Australia and places like that. Of course, you know, COVID borders closed has meant they haven't been able to do that. So, yeah, so in fact, they actually indicated that about  of those increases related to escalating salary costs. They have had to encourage us to just to keep their staffing in place. And then I think the third factor is that these fees are not just set by, you know, Leon, our local auditor. You know, these fees go through quite a significant national moderation process.  So, yeah, so look, I am confident that our local auditors couldn't set a fee that's out of kilter with the rest of the country. So, yeah, so those things were all explained at the Audit and Risk Committee, and therefore, yeah, you know, the fees were agreed to.",

Today, I have the RMA report and we're basically seeking your approval to a number of amendments to council delegations to staff.  This followed quite an in-depth review that we undertook of the RMA delegations, basically going through section by section to making sure that current delegations we had were still fit for purpose. So we're proposing a number of changes just to provide greater clarity of the scope of the delegations, also to ensure that the delegations are to the correct staff members and the staff roles.  and to ensure that the overall delegations are comprehensive enough to ensure that they're appropriately delegated to ensure the most efficient, effective use of the different functions. I haven't gone through in the paper line by line an explanation of each one, because there are quite a few amendments, but they are all outlined in track changes and appendix two to the report. But I'm very happy to take any questions you might have on any of the proposed amendments.",

I'm sure Carl recalls this actually, just to give us more enforcement options. Because it means, because we don't have that tool, we're actually classifying more dogs as menacing, yeah.  I think it'd be a really good idea to highlight in the executive summary that we haven't had a response to it because it's sort of in the body of the report, but I'm pretty disappointed that it hasn't been taken up by central government.

OK, so we'll reconvene the meeting after that short break and we're on to item.  the feedback to local government New Zealand on the three waters. And I did mention to Dawn that it's not only feedback to local government New Zealand, it's feedback to the DIA as well. So we just need to tidy that up. And I'm sure Dawn will comment on that as we go through the discussions.  So, and as I mentioned earlier on in the meeting, it's certainly the reforms are creating quite a stir across the country. And I suppose from my perspective, the comment that is often touted out at the beginning of the discussion is that everybody agrees that there's need for a change. And I find that,  almost insulting, I suppose, in that if you say you don't think there's a need for change, the criticism is you're burying your head in the sand. But I think local government across New Zealand has been changing continuously and improving the standards of their infrastructure and their supplies.  But obviously not fast enough. And a lot of that is down to funding and financing. And for as long as I can remember, councils have been asking for reform on how a number of our functions are funded.  rather than just property taxes. So look, I think everybody is definitely open for change and we all want to achieve the same result, which is better drinking water and better environmental outcomes, both from a sewage and a stormwater disposal situation. So look, at the moment, Gary, I don't know whether you want to make any introductory comments or we hand over straight to Dawn.  go through the report that Dawn has provided for us, and then I'll open it up for questions. And it's probably easier, Dawn, for you to go through your report, and then we'll have questions at the end, I would suggest. Is everyone comfortable with that? Yeah, Gary, did you want to comment? No introduction required from me, Your Worship. Okay, Dawn, hand it over to you.",

    "text": " Lovely. Thank you, Your Worship. I have put together just a few slides as a bit of an introduction. So if I might just share that now. I've sort of acknowledged the report is quite long and so I'm taking it as read. But yeah, just wanted to  sort of, I guess, highlight a few key areas. So we obviously had our workshop a fortnight ago, and in the report is a submission to the government's proposal that's based on feedback coming through that. And as Your Worship, as you noted in the last fortnight, the Three Waters Steering Committee have advised that they would like us to direct our submission to both LGNZ and back to the DIA.  So just a reminder of the process where we find ourselves in this eight-week feedback period, that it's feedback on the proposal from the government, getting that feedback back by the end of this week. And the government, the most recent information I saw was yesterday, where it was indicated that a government decision will be made in October.  but whether that was sort of going to be realised or not because there's obviously going to be a lot of information for the DIA and government officials to work through. I also note that last week there were a number of media statements made by a DIA representative saying that the DIA people were looking at forming a working group of elected members  to re-look at the governance framework and looking at the proposal and that very complex diagram that had been included within the proposal. So that's certainly interesting in terms of the concerns that have been raised across the country around that are being acknowledged and responded to.  So just to confirm, in terms of the basis of the proposal that we are providing, and it's on this basis that the Appendix 8 to the report has been prepared very much on our previous discussions. Your Worship, you noted earlier the Entity B Hui held last week, and we shared the report, which was the survey across those 22 entities,  and the draft letter that was going to be sent off this week. Also last week, a further document was released was the stormwater technical report. And there's still debate sort of going on as to whether this is a three water reform proposal or a two water reform proposal.  And certainly that indicated that the technical group was saying that this should be a three water proposal, even though stormwater has such a significant impact in terms of our land use and strategic land use planning across the district.  Also following up on Councillor O'Regan's earlier update from the Te Amiru Community Board, I thought it was just acknowledging the resolution that arose from that meeting. And that was that the Te Amiru Community Board recommend that council retain complete control of the district water assets and reject the government's current three waters proposal to acquire these assets.  This slide I didn't update, but providing numbers from late yesterday, we were still getting quite a bit of feedback emails coming in late yesterday. So as of the 27th of September, we had 115 pieces of feedback from the community.  105 who did not support the reforms, although I've got to note that two of those who did not support the reforms did note that they agreed with the new regulator, compliance regulator of Te Mata Atawai, and said that that was needed within the sector. The six who supported the reforms and the four unsure, so those numbers were the same. So alongside this process, obviously we've  been receiving this feedback and the key themes that I've been sharing with you were along the lines that Waip\u0101 does manage its water services really, really well. So why are we looking to change? Local is better, not necessarily bigger is better.  Concerns around the loss of assets and risks around cross-subsidisation. The governance model as proposed was not trusted by our community. Significant concerns around the lack of true consultation on the reform programme and many, many people calling for a referendum.  Some commentary in that Waters should, so this was something that came through from someone who supported the reform saying that Waters funding should come from taxpayers, not just from ratepayers, given the environmental benefits that would be seen from the reform programme, but also a lot of commentary that this was all happening far too quickly for people. Do you want to get another slide?",

    "text": "Yeah, that would be helpful, Dawn.  So I circulated this to the councillors yesterday, and I just, I suppose, felt that we should be making the point that we support government endeavours to resolve iwi, Maori rights and interests in water, but  using community assets to satisfy a Crown responsibility is not appropriate. Local government, to my understanding, is not a party to the Treaty, and to  try and bring in 50% ownership control, whatever you want to call it, for M\u0101ori is something that the Crown needs to resolve and not using community assets. So I felt that that was an important point to make.  And I just wanted to firm up the summary of the draft that Dawn had put forward and just make sure that it was abundantly clear that we don't support the reforms in their present form.  So that was just a suggestion that I had. And I know that a number of councillors may well have a lot of other comments to make. And Claire has certainly circulated to me. I'm not sure whether it went to everybody, her views as well. But look, that was just a point that I thought we should be making. Thanks, Dawn. So can we go back to the full screen?  Absolutely. So, questions or comments, questions to Dawn or Gary, and then, and any comments anybody has.",

    "text": "Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Jim. Firstly, I want to thank Gary and Dawn and the others on the team for the material that we've got. Like, I do really appreciate the effort that's been put in to summarise things and  It was great to get that survey from the Entity 2 people to read as well, that Morrison Lowe did, and it's really helped clarify things, I felt. So I did circulate, and I also agree completely with what you circulated, Jim, yesterday, and I think it's a really important point to make about the interests and rights of iwi and how it seems to be using  community assets to try and resolve what is really a treaty issue, I think. So I've got some other points that I wanted to make, particularly around the funding tools that we have, because I do feel that that's been a failing of central government, that we haven't, we've requested these things, but we haven't been given them. And so the two that I highlighted and what I circulated was the revenue bonds, which was mentioned in the Castalia reports,  So it is a legitimate funding option and it's used successfully overseas where those loans aren't counted as part of a council's external debt. And so they don't need to be taken into account when you're working with your caps and your limits or your credit ratings with rating agencies and things like that. And the second,  Example I gave was green financing, where we're heading towards carbon zero net emissions, that where you've got carbon credits, the savings that are made with the new waste water treatment plants, as we're seeing with the Cambridge one that's proposed, this actually provides a significant funding stream that would really reduce the burden on rate payers  for financing these improvements. Now, if that business is taken away from councils and put with a water entity, we have no idea whether or not they would make use of those carbon credits. And in fact, it could be argued that if we do have that tool available, communities could probably afford to do these upgrades and not go through this,  really huge upheaval that's been proposed. I'm also not really comfortable at all actually about the stormwater being included. I just feel it's not being thought through enough yet. It's so complex and convoluted and I don't think we're ready to do that yet. I do think it's underbaked at the moment. So those are my main comments.",

    "text": "Yeah, thank you, Amir-Jim.  I totally agree with the suggested amendments, Jim, that you've made. And Claire, I really acknowledge and respect some of the alternative funding models and approaches that you think have been missed, and I definitely agree with you. I think it's a way forward. And just following on from what you just said there, Jim, my understanding from the LGNZ document was that  this period of time was given to us to identify issues of local concern, provide feedback on those, and suggestions of how the proposal could be strengthened. And I guess I kind of, the question is whether are we looking at strengthening the current proposal or are we actually rejecting the current proposal and saying that there are alternatives out there? So I don't propose I'm gonna resolve that, but I suppose that's kind of where we're sitting. I guess from where I sit, and I'm sorry, I have made a few notes that might sound a little bit wooden, but I've,  You know, while this proposal might not be entirely clear, what has been pretty clear is what is known by this table and by the communities and our efforts to try and get some feedback from them is that they actually are opposed to it. And it's an unequivocal opposition in my view. I accept that 91% of the feedback that we've managed to glean from our website  as an opposition, but I can tell you wholeheartedly, and I'm sure many of you are the same, that you've pretty much had 100% opposition to you directly. My inbox has been flooded. My messenger has been going bananas, particularly over the last week, probably with the whole issue coming to a greater media retention and what have you. So I think that 91% is probably a little bit  on the softer side, I would think it's probably a really overwhelming opposition in our communities. And I acknowledge the appendix we have there. I agree with it as far as it goes, including those amendments that Jim has proposed. But I don't know if it goes far enough to express our real overwhelming opposition as an elected membership and as people representing the thoughts of our community.  And I know that we've been told we're not allowed to consult, it's not time, but let's be fair, let's be honest. We have received an overwhelming, no, not now, too fast, don't like it kind of response from our communities. So I think the subtlety of the wording in that appendix fails to encapsulate that real opposition. And so I support what we've got there, but I just want it, I'd like it to sound more,  more oppositional, if that's at all possible. Because it's not just, oh, we're not really liking it much. It's actually a real dislike. And I accept we're not in a position now to opt in or out. That's not really where we're at in that space. But I think the language could be changed such that it's a very clear rejection of the proposal as it currently stands, as we understand it to be. I guess from my perspective,  I personally would like to go a step further. This may not find any support around our table, but I want to express some frustration with this entire process. You know, I'm really disappointed that initially some, what was it, last November when we started having our meetings with DIA, there seemed to be a real desire for there to be a consultative and a cooperative partnership-based approach as it was touted as being.  And I guess originally the timeframes and the timeline set out were really transparent and I felt like we were actually being involved. But I suspect that good faith was probably eroded quite significantly with that very expensive and insulting advertising campaign. And then we moved into a phase where everything became very much a spoon-fed or drip-fed information need-to-know process, which didn't fill me with lots of confidence  lots of belief that we were working in partnership with them despite the media or their collateral insisting that that was the case. So I suspect that there's been quite an erosion of confidence in that relationship, and that doesn't bode well for making sound decisions going forward. You know, this reform process was launched in July last year, you know, it's only 14 months ago. This is a major intergenerational project of such significance and change about  something that's such a fundamental resource necessary to sustain human life and activity. And I just feel it's way too rushed. And that bears out from a lot of the comments that other councils have expressed in the last day or so, a call to slow down, a call to approach this in a manner that requires a lot more agreement across the board, because this is gonna be hard to push through in sight of such opposition  across all councils, give or take one or two, and in the face of overwhelming community opposition in terms of what's known so far. And I accept that there is an ability there for the government to pass enabling legislation, but I think it would be unwise. I think they need to sit back and we need to slow down and get greater buy-in. So that's sort of my little lecture. That's how I see it. I mean, a lot more other things I wanted to say, but I think that kind of, it is in a nutshell.  kind of toughen up some of the wording in our appendix, Appendix 8, in terms of our submission, I would be really supportive. But yeah, I agree with Claire's comments to Dawn. Really good summary of the journey we've travelled so far, and I really appreciated the work that went into that, so thank you.",

Just in your first lead-in to that comment, to say, we support government's move to resolve Maori rights. Well, if you look at Nanaia Mahuta's paper to the cabinet,  I can't support that paper to cabinet because that really suggests Maori ownership of water, and I'm not in favour of that at all.

And I also agree, Jim, with the proposal that you put forward. But what I am very concerned about is that we are conveniently forgetting the reason for this proposed reforms by the government, and that is efficiencies and lower costs to our water-connected ratepayers.  To me, we have a responsibility to look after the financial, I suppose, costs that our ratepayers are going to incur in receiving their water. And this is, to me, really important. We're kind of presuming that  Waip\u0101 District Council will be able to achieve the efficiencies and cost structures that Entity B is projected to achieve. And I don't think that's realistic. So while the government proposal needs a lot of work, there's no two ways about it. And yes, it's rushed. And yes, we've been very much better if the  reports on the reform of local government had preceded this, you know, I think it behooves us to really consider the financial and efficiency implications that the government proposals. And those proposals don't come from politicians. I've said this before. They come from water engineers, experts in the field who know what they're talking about. We ignore that sort of stuff at our peril, in my view.  So yeah, they're my comments. But again, really well done, Dawn, to you and your team. That's a great report.",

Obviously, we've got to do the best job that we can, but the community actually,  don't want necessarily the cheapest outcome. And I always reflect on the fact that our community, our two main towns are only 20 minutes apart. You can, on an efficiency argument alone, you could argue that we only need one swimming pool and one library situated somewhere within the district because the access is easy. But the community tell us,  convenience and equity in access, and those sorts of things are important as well. And it's not just the straight dollar.  discussion, I suppose, in terms of making it more acceptable, I suppose, to the community. So I always come back to the fact that, yes, you can argue the efficiency, but you lose the effectiveness. And I just see  rural and provincial New Zealand in particular, just losing out more and more with the centralization that's going on, and that you can always support centralizing services based on an efficiency perspective, but that doesn't necessarily build the communities that we want.

And it sort of comes back to the whole ownership question that we've tossed around a little bit. You know, to say that the ratepayers, or even water-connected ratepayers, own our water assets is just wrong, in my view. It's a very strange kind of ownership that means that if you move out of the district  you do not receive any compensation for those assets that you've paid for over time that you've been connected to water. What the ratepayers or water connected ratepayers are actually purchasing is simply the delivery of the water systems, wastewater, stormwater. The local authority, Waip\u0101 District Council, certainly they own or we own  those water assets. The ratepayers don't. What the ratepayers are really interested in is the delivery. And it's just going to be delivered better by Entity B than it can be by Waip\u0101 District Council. And I just don't see where the concern about control is in respect of  you know, new subdivisions or whatever, we will be, excuse me, that's the cat, we will be a customer of this new entity who will be able to more efficiently provide, utilize the current providers that are already there, all those contractors. It just, yeah,  There's no concern, in my view, about this control aspect. In fact, we will be all better off, quite clearly, in my view.

It's actually, I find it difficult to get everything I'm thinking across because it's so, it is very complex. But that Taumata Arawai, the new water service entity,  I mean, I guess what everyone does agree is the current standards are going to change. So that's, there's no issue there. And that's going to happen very, very soon. And they're going to resource that. And the standards that we currently have are not going to be there around, down the track. So water across the whole country and the quality of it is going to have to increase. So I don't think probably many of us would disagree with that.  What I take a little bit, well, no, what I disagree with is that I don't think this is just about the experts coming up with there needs to be change. This, to me, is absolutely interwoven with a political decision. This is a need based on increasing quality that the government have come up with, and that's their right, through Taumata Arawai.  But it's also, in my mind, also politically driven. And that's just, if it's the elephant in the room, it's the elephant in the room. But the taking us away from council control and effectively giving it to an entity that is massively disproportionately constructed in terms of the makeup of their governance group is  is something I don't think this country has seen. Well, it probably has, but not public like this. So I think one's got their head in the sand if they don't think this could have major impact. Te Ao M\u0101ori world is not the world I grew up in. I know a little bit about it, but it's not my world, and I have absolute respect for it. But I would want to know how that world really is going to impact on a New Zealand world.  in Aotearoa world and te ao M\u0101ori, that's not something I've got enough knowledge of to understand how they may influence water in this country. Now, the chances are it could be very, very positive. But I guess my main message is not asking  that change doesn't need to happen. What we're asking for is Taiho government, step back, take your time, don't just focus on the next election. It's better to get this right together as a nation and everyone in this nation, not  parts of it, whether politically, ethnic based, but getting this right together and getting a system that is going to last forever, not last election cycles before the next government legislates to change it. So, yeah, so look, I'm not opposed to change at all. And I've said that before. I mean, I'm in a position where change is constant.  I just don't think this is very well-managed change at all. And the strong message that needs to go through and Councillor O'Regan formed it is that I am strongly opposed to the currently what's been put forward, because I think it needs more time to be explored, not because changes need to happen, it's getting the right change from New Zealand out to the world.",

So Appendix 8, which I think Appendix 8 is going to become quite famous around our table. And when I take a look at what the community has been telling me over, I guess, several weeks,  And I've read and I've reread Appendix 8, and I still feel it's close to being reflective of what our community is, and reading I have done, but it's probably just still too soft. When I look at all the information that's out there in the public arena,  We've seen lots of advertisements on TV. So our public are reasonably informed actually, and there's a lot of information or access to information. And for me, overwhelmingly, the message is really, really clear. Our communities really just don't want to see a handover of our community assets. It seems to be the biggest issue that I've had emailed and voiced to me is around the assets that it appears that  you know, we don't have, at this point, a really clear view of who is going to own them and how that's going to work. So those assets just seem to be the biggest threat that's coming through, you know, from what I'm hearing. So somehow or another, there's no doubt in my mind our communities are simply not interested in water reform. They want good water, don't get me wrong. And I think, you know, a lot of what we've said around the table here  There's no question around quality and standards that Waip\u0101 has nearly always delivered. It's around the reform, and I just don't think our communities want it.

It's not fed into the sea like maybe some of the other cities and  entities around the coast of New Zealand and and I think you're going to take a heck of a lot more convincing for them to believe that a change to a big organization and you know currently we senior citizens have had a lot to look at we've been told that change to technology is good and yet we haven't found that you know so I I can see where their thinking gets blocked when you can actually see  that change is not necessarily when things currently are not looking too bad.",

    "text": "Yeah thanks Hazel. Look I think  That's a fair comment that the feedback we're getting is based on the standards that is set for in Waip\u0101. But we do need to acknowledge that around the country that that standard is not universal and there are problems out there. And it's not only in terms of the quality, it's also  the ability to be able to fund the new standards that are going to be enforced and have the communities got the capacity to actually to fund those improvements. And I suppose I always come back to the fact, well, if the community haven't got that ability, then that's when central government needs to step in, as they have done in the past with grants and  to enable those communities to be able to look after themselves with a bit of help. So, but look, I think it's definitely a concern from central government that the costs are going to grow and the communities have got to be strong enough to be able to actually fund those changes.  But look, I think we've all just been through our 10-year plans. There's been a colossal increase in the costs that we've all identified going into our plans. And I think it was, well, a number of the speakers have already said, take your time, do it and take everybody with us. And we've got time to have a look and see if the communities can actually deliver what they say they're going to deliver.  in their 10-year plans. Over the next three years, we will know if we can actually deliver the intent, I suppose, of that 10-year plan.",

I just wanted to say on the water, I found the advertising campaign by the government a real affront to local government New Zealand. When you see ads where you have green water coming into a bath, it is beyond belief. Now, we went to a meeting at Rotorua  where we asked the Department of Internal Affairs what did they think was an estimate of the number of people affected by bad water. Now the answer was 30,000 people and we sat there in amazement but came home and did some homework. In the Ministry of Health records it showed 537 people were supposedly, they suspected, affected by water in their system. Guess what?  Not one of those people laying a complaint or going to a doctor was drinking water from a council entity. It was water from outside council entities. Yet the government had built on the Havelock North as the big ogre, and you've all got to change. We've got the people that are going to be looking after the water. I do not know from a person that's been involved with water all my life what the hell they're going to do  to make Waip\u0101 water better. It's beyond belief. And I honestly don't believe big is better. Every time we get a big outfit, it's sloppy and no service, and the ratepayers get grumpy. The other thing that hasn't been mentioned in our submission is the serious effect it's going to have by losing between 43 and 45 staff, men on the ground and support staff,  for our water entity and what that does to council. And that, to me, is a real effect that we need to be looking at. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Graeme.",

One, I think maybe for you, Dawn,  Is there any truth to what I've heard that even rural water tanks will have testing imposed on them at the owner's cost? That's one.

    "text": " Correct. Thank you, your mayor. I just wanted to say a couple of things that really quite concern me. Firstly, I agree totally with Dawn and Jim, your paragraph. Very good. Excellent. I think it is. But I do happen to agree with what Susan was saying earlier, that we do need to be a bit stronger. One thing that really worries me is that we don't have this criteria that they're saying we're going to have higher standards.  but we're being told that that's in the future. We don't get told what these higher standards are going to be. They will develop that at some future time. And this seems to be the whole addict behind everything we're looking at at the moment, that we don't even ask specifics. We get told it's in the future. It will save money. We will be able to achieve these things if we comply. However, we don't have the ground rules that we're having to comply with.  And that really worries me. It comes right back to that. The big thing I have with this as well, that this is very much a top-down decision. We as local bodies have always governed as a local body from a bottom up. We react to what our ratepayers, who are our principal funders, actually require of us. And I feel that this is far more coming from a top-down. And I happen to agree a little bit with what Councillor Pettit or Mike said,  There's more of an agenda for this than we believe because we haven't got what this will impact on us with local governance or with the Resource Management Act and all of the others, which all have to be released. This is too quick. And it is in a situation where I believe they haven't thought of stormwater. We've got large areas of land that we use in swales, et cetera. Who owns them? Who's going to control them? How is it going to happen? This needs a huge amount of discussion before we go any further.  And I strongly believe that we want to go back at this consultory page to government and say that we need far more input and more time and more information before we can develop this.",

And we are actually Waip\u0101 district councillors. We're not New Zealand councillors or MPs or anything else. We're actually here to look after 50-odd thousand ratepayers in our district.  And with that, again, around this rush and this timing, our staff have not, you know, we're about to spend tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars on water upgrades over the next 10 years, in fact, hundreds of millions of dollars, sorry, over the next 10 years, which we have factored into an average rate increase, which our community are happy to accept. The sewage system that we're looking at putting on to Cambridge is  the equivalent of the top-notch current system in New Zealand. If not, it's going to be better. So you would surely hope that our system will meet those standards in terms of that component of the water.  And I guess the other thing is our staff have not been given the opportunity or the time, and we'll never get the time if this goes through in its current format, to actually do the real analysis on what infrastructure, based on these standards that Lou's talked about, how are we placed as Waip\u0101 District to actually meet these going? Is it going to be, as the government has said, really unaffordable? Are we actually luckily in a position  where it is actually going to be affordable for our ratepayers. And it comes back to, we're actually elected by our ratepayers, not elected nationally.

    "text": "And Roger, I think you're right. And I think that in one sense, that's where local government collectively has fallen down in the  far distant past when their Ministry of Works were around, they ran training programmes for water treatment plant operators, sewage treatment plant operators. They had public health engineers that advised Council. And when a  the reforms of the 1980s struck and that was all disbanded, local government should really have picked up that responsibility and started employing cadets and training people because there is a real shortage in the industry at the moment and it's almost like truck drivers, everybody's getting older and dropping off and all of those training skills and things that were built up in the past, now the chickens are coming home to roost.  And I suppose in some of the more detailed submissions and the changes that we could make to make things better is that maybe it's,  over to local government New Zealand to pick that responsibility up and start organizing the necessary training and maybe employing those public health engineers to give advice to the council around the country to avoid us having to go out to expensive consultants. So there's all of those sorts of improvements that we should be doing.  or could be doing, and maybe we have dropped the ball in terms of making sure that we've looked after our industry for the long term. So I definitely think there's improvements that we need to do as a collective that we probably can't do on our own. But I certainly 100% agree with Mike's comments and others that  we are elected to look after Waip\u0101 and not the nation, although obviously we've got an interest in what's going on. That's not where our responsibility lies. So look, I've taken out of the discussion, look, there's a strong, apart from Andrew, I acknowledge your concerns about the efficiency side of it, but the majority, I think,  feeling that the Appendix 8, which is our submission, needs to be strengthened so that it's really clear that we are opposed to the reforms as they stand at the moment, but we're not opposed to  approving the standards of water and sewage and stormwater across the country.

And of course, the difficulty is like, how would we even work something up for that? Because we're not resourced for it, we haven't really planned for it or anything.

So I suppose,  It's a piece of work that local government New Zealand should be doing, and maybe we should be putting it on them to actually do the necessary work on this issue, because it's too big for one council to front this on its own.

There's no suggestion that the drinking water standards are going to go up  it's just that they're going to enforce the ones that are already there. And that's what didn't happen in Havelock. But in terms of obviously, sewerage discharge standards are going to obviously need to be set and as stormwater are. But if the regulator starts enforcing those standards over  the first three years of our 10-year plans and starts to find, actually identify where these problems are, the assumptions at the moment, then the whole country can focus its attention on fixing the problems that are in possibly isolated pockets around the country and stop wasting a whole lot of money on areas that actually don't need reform.

But look, I totally agree with your frustrations, Graham, you know, and I guess what I was trying to say earlier about the process being really,  I found frustrating and disillusioning in equal measure.

Hey, thank you for the discussion, and I hope everyone's had the opportunity to put their point of view. This is really a critical issue for local communities across the country. So, it is one of the most important issues we've had to decide on, I suppose, certainly in my term.  All right, thank you for that. So we're moving on. The next resolution we need to exclude the public. We have- I'll move. Graeme moved and Andrew second. All those in favour? Aye.",
