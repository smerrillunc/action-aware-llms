So we can move on to disclosure of members' interests. So can I just remind everyone that if you do have any interest in any of the things that we're about to discuss, where a conflict would arise, can you please let us know about those now?

Sally, are you, or Joe, I presume we've got no other, no late items to add this afternoon. Okay, so can I please have someone move that the order of the meeting be confirmed as outlined in our agenda? Lou, I've got another waiver. Gary, thank you. Oops, hang on, I've just got to swap mouses.  OK, so our next item, of course, is our draft annual plan submission. Now, I'm not going to read through all of that for you because seeing as that was the only thing on our agenda, I assume you all have read that. So we probably can most likely just jump down to our recommendation.  Well, actually, firstly, is there anything anyone wanted to change in that or are we all, in essence, happy with what's outlined in that report for our submissions?",
