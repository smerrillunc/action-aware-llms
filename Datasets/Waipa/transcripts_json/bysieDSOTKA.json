Firstly, with respect to Wallace Terrace, the works there for the removal of pipes and installing new pipes are underway with a monitor on site as recommended under the cultural impact assessment.  Ghorst Avenue water renewals proceeding there and are almost complete. It's under an archaeological authority. Kihikihi water supply. So the additional supply to improve resilience of the town, which will connect through at the corner of Rolleston and Gray Street.  So an archaeological authority is required for that one. It is a military stockade ark site, but still requires, apparently it still requires a discussion with Ng\u0101ui T\u014dp\u016b, and we'll be taking that there. The next available slot we can get.  Te Awamutu water supply, so the work from Pukurimu to Te Awamutu. So there was a karakia held there in June, which I think a number of you will have attended.  both at Parallel Road and Taylors Hill, the receiving site. Looking to complete that work, commissioning, have that online in October. Just note there, though, that I think we're still to agree to be put in place at both of those sites.  Finally, Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant, just noting that the Kaitiaki group is meeting regularly there. Detailed business case underway for the Hamilton Waikato Spatial Plan area. And staff are continuing to plan for Cambridge Standalone Plant.  for possible consent lodgment in September 22. Kaitiaki Group have been involved in that design as well. And sorry, finally, the comprehensive stormwater consent renewal. So Julian and Norm have been  involved in that as consultants. They presented to me, now we talked to her a couple of times, so pretty much going through the information gathering process of that at the moment.  from which we'll create a spatial map, overlying scientific and cultural info for further investigation and look at possible opportunities for improvement around that. And again, looking to lodge with the Regional Council early 2022. If there are any questions on that between Rene and I, we might be able to sort those out.",

There's been cultural monitoring occurring at the site and that on top of that, the old pipes have been taken out of the of the whenua. So that was something that went through Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b and Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b approved. And I just wanted to acknowledge for council that are here how significant that piece of work has been.

I've read some of the information around that site, and it conflicts with the Ngati Porou tradition. The information we have is totally at odds  to the general information that everyone's talking about for the Altafa site. And that's a good example of how the site-specific information should be applied only to that site. Just a comment on that. What I want to talk about is that the Kiki Alternative Water Supply  connection point. There's a note in the report that you gave, Gary, around it's a registered archaeological site. One of the problems with archaeological registration is that they don't take into any account whatsoever the custody and cultural significance of the site. And I think that's something that's  completely overlooked with every application we get around their involvement. I want to make the point that the site we're talking about there in Kiki was where Kiki Pa was, and that's where the name Kiki came from. And I think  Once we start looking at that sort of stuff, we need to get some very specific information about that particular site as well. And this is with reference to the corner of, where is it? Well, it's on Gray Street, that area there.  Once we've been able to complete our information panels for the, well, we've already put them aside, I intend to put that up there on public display so that information is there available. At the moment, it's only held in our own customary archives.  And I think the opportunity for us to be able to get that for council's use, or proper use, is something that we need to look at.

And we're participating in part of that change right here and now as we find ourselves on Zoom.  but looking at our partnerships and how we might want to engage going forward. Now, the notion is that at the moment, and I've touched base with some of our mana whenua groups and going forward with our iwi authorities to talk through and find if there's a better way through co-design of engagement.  in as much as that we recognize that both mana whenua and our iwi authorities are all at different levels of resourcing and capacity. And that capacity is time, capacity, et cetera, and the human resource as well. And we know that our workloads and demands coming from  Waipa District Council, which is only one council. And there's a swag of others out there making a similar demand on iwi across the district. And looking at trying to find an easier way going forward. One that recognizes a number of principles for the engagement for partnership. So this will be  Approaches will be continued, be made to mana whenua, initial approaches and discussions. I've had that discussion with some of you on board now and progressing that for the rest of the year to the point of being able to establish a small group that might take on the onerous task of creating a model  that might best suit iwi in the first instance for the many paths that we have going ahead. So that's basically what it is. It's an open session of conversations with mana whenua r\u014dp\u016b and with iwi authorities.  And to a certain degree, it is about putting down what we have now and reimagining the space against the backdrop of demands and calls for more engagement, not less. So that's where we are at the moment.",

It's not a comfortable place to be in. And I'm very aware that I've not been as active in the Waikae District work that I started some four or five years ago, as I was  as I want to be. But the capability and the capacity of our small community groups is stretched to the limit where we have to sacrifice some of our long-standing relationships. Now, that's not a choice thing. That's out of a decision on, they are better to leave them aside right now because I can always go back there.  It doesn't mean to say that we're walking away from the relationship. It just means that we cannot handle the whole lot with the very limited resources and manpower that we have on the ground. That applies to all our mana whenua groupings and committees and organizations that are doing their best  to try to manage the myriad of demands that are coming on top of us right now. This is just something that has evolved with time, I guess.  Wi-Fi has had a good relationship for a long time where there was no competition, but all of a sudden there's competition for our services that we've enjoyed with Wi-Fi for a long time.

Either we are providing that human resource or we need to provide more of it at the council level.  so that it's not all left in regards to Ng\u0101iwi, T\u014dp\u016b or each of the mana whenua. We should certainly be involved, but it would be useful to begin to look at how equitable the council's resources are in a human factor in promoting the council's matters for co-design, engagement and partnership.  And if I could just raise the one that is certainly in the foremost of Apakura's mind at the moment, the lakes. We've got separate ownership of a lot of the lakes with Council, DOC, and the whole lot of, and I think Waikato District. And just trying, I know we've got a Pete Lakes Accord that meets, but we need,  We can't be at each one of the hui that's been set up for every lake.

And overall, you know, the restoration of the peat lakes across the whole of the Waip\u0101.  Waikato is something we'd like to think was possible.

Also,  Ng\u0101ti Hoa have indicated that they are unlikely to be able to put anyone through as well. Again, it's a resourcing issue for all of those iwi authorities. So it does go to what I think Bill was saying around resourcing of mana whenua and how stretched  they are at the moment. And I think that is something we'd have to look at quite closely in the work that Shane is leading there about how we can help fill that gap. Also just wanted to raise around the Iwi Consultative Committee. I think we'd be looking at how this committee itself evolves through that as well and see if there are  more effective, efficient ways that we can do things. And also to note that, you know, we've already, we've had the appointment of Te K\u0101nohi over the, just over a year ago now, and we had any job description that they would report to Ng\u0101i Whi T\u014dku and the iwi consultative committee, but we've never  formalized whether they should be members of this committee or not. So that's something I'd be quite keen for committee to just to think about whether Te K\u0101nohe should be here.

So yeah, it's been quite a journey but we've got there in the end. We are  really wanting people like developers who are trying to select new names for roads and reserves to be talking very early on in the process with Tangata Whenua. So we could really need to identify who those people will need to be. And if the developers don't, then we  we'll try and facilitate that discussion as well, just to try to get a fuller range of potential names that we can consider from that particular area, so council can make the final choice. We've also got provisions, of course, for renaming, and you'll see in the report, a lot of the submissions that came in were about renaming of  roads. We wanted it to be possible. But on the other hand, we didn't want to encourage everyone to try to change the names of the streets where they live. Because it's not an easy process. It's very expensive. There's a lot that we've got to consider with any renaming application.  which is why we're not looking at revisiting all the names proactively. As I say, if there's a head of steam within a community to rename a particular street or reserve, then we definitely want to have that process in place so it can be done.

We went straight into the minutes and I didn't acknowledge that in terms of kaupapa M\u0101ori. So kia ora, Jim. Thanks for that.  Can I just also add that having listened to the submissions, there were a number of community submissions that I wanted to, you know, to acknowledge and thank the community for those submissions. I listened, the plus about lockdown was that I was able to listen to some of these and there was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Anderson that spoke in regards to  to Kihikihi and the street names in Kihikihi and the fact that there is maimai to us in just traversing up and down the streets in Kihikihi, maybe even just to go to the shop. And the other key component in terms of having listened to the submissions was that there was mention of the fact that there wasn't a budget  put aside for the renaming. And I think that it's significant in terms of Kehikihi. And I'm hoping that there is, Graeme, a process that you are going to be entering into with some degree of urgency, I would ask, for the renaming of streets in Kehikihi that have a certain grievance.  from our perspective, and that there will be some urgency in terms of the funding to go along with those, the renaming Council's funding in regards to renaming those streets that do hold that hara for us.",

We wrote it to not be retrospective, so we're not going to go back and rename streets proactively, but we were very conscious of the feeling within Kiki, which is why we wanted to have the renaming provisions there. So although we weren't anticipating  doing any renaming ourselves we're waiting for the or encouraging communities to come forward so there's community support there but if there is a will within council to  to actually move that forward as a project, then that would presumably have to have a business case and the budget brought forward. Obviously, we've got annual plans that are developed, and obviously, there'll be the new long-term plan coming in the next couple of years. The work on that will be starting probably  this time next year. So there are opportunities to revisit that. So it's by no means impossible. Where there's a will, then I'm sure we can find the way of doing it. But it might be that there are particular names within Kiki that the community would wish to prioritize.  So we'd be interested in any feedback from there. And I see we've got councillors from Kiki as well. So there are quite a number of channels for getting that kind of information through to us. It would probably be the transportation team running that if it's road names and the Parks and Reserves team if it's reserve names.",

But that shouldn't be taken as a  I suppose an indication that Council's not going to put a budget aside for it. And I think Graham's comment is right that we should probably do this in an orderly fashion and identify those street names that are causing the hurt and concern that we already have.  are aware of, even if it's just through casual conversation. But if we are going to change some street names and a collection of them rather than just maybe one or two, for argument's sake, we should probably put up a  a good reason to argument for that and actually have that community debate and put some funding aside to actually do those changes. So the fact that it's just not in a budget over the next one or two years doesn't mean that that money can't be made available for those changes.  if that's what the community wants and iwi want. So I suppose it's really a case of identifying which streets that are on the list that need to be changed and mount that argument and put that case, I suppose, to the community.",

And initially the council, if it wasn't necessarily one of these historical problems, would consider whether there was merit in the request. And if there was merit in the request, then it would be council's cost to actually run the process and undertake the change.  with the necessary consultation. So I think initially, the request could or should come from mana whenua saying these are the street names that we are concerned about for whatever reason that you have. And I appreciate there are  sound reasons for it and request council to actually undertake that process, we could then have a look at what the cost of that is going to be and appropriately fund it. And certainly,  in terms of timing, by the time we work through the process, the actual costs are not gonna come for one or two years out at the very best.

This is just a very brief update on the Papakainga plan change that we are starting to progress now in the RMA policy team. So,  At the June meeting of this committee, there was an update given by my senior, Jo Cook-Monroe, about an internal scoping report that we had been looking at and what information we already had about papakainga within the district plan.  We got some feedback from that meeting and the points noted were that we need to review the current definition of papakainga in the plan because it isn't necessarily fit for purpose anymore. And apparently you talked about the Waikato District Council approach and the model that they used and  It may not be entirely appropriate in Waip\u0101 District because in Waikato District they have a lot of M\u0101ori land under the M\u0101ori Land Court and we don't necessarily have that here. So if the rules were based on being able to use M\u0101ori land for papak\u0101inga, it might not work so well here.  You wanted the ability to build papakainga across the district and not just next to marae. So it could be in towns where people want to live and they can go to school and work. And Matamata Piako District Council is also progressing a papakainga plan change for their district plan.  So we've noted those points. Myself and Joe attended the most recent meeting of Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u016bp\u016b in August, and we were there to talk about consultation and how we might, our next steps in terms of consultation to progress the plan change.  So it was agreed to arrange a hui to be held at the Parawera Marae. Thank you very much to Gaylene for offering her premises there. And that was to be with all iwi. So it was like going to be a come one and come all, and let's discuss where we need to go with this. So I had approached Gary to help me with, you know,  to begin the arrangements to organise this hui, but of course now we've gone into lockdown, it's a little bit more difficult to make those steps. So this is really just to update you on where we're at, that we are making progress, but we're anticipating that it might take a little while to get through all the issues.",

    "text": "Harold? Yeah, just a couple of comments.  And I referred back to the Papak\u0101inga definition within our district plan. I recall that discussion when we first looked at creating an opportunity for Papak\u0101inga. And what I do recall is that we were all quite naive around  what that actually meant, and hence the relationship to marae became the focus for the development of public haunga. But that seemed to be the institutional area on which those things were created for M\u0101ori at the time. That's 30 years ago now, and we're still trying to deal with it. But what I wanted to say that  The relationship with marae has no relevance whatsoever on M\u0101ori land or M\u0101ori-owned land in the district. And that's because of the many, what we call, negatives that have transpired around that ownership right. Things like Ropatu, the M\u0101ori Land Court,  the change from collective kaichake to individual ownership. Those are all negative impacts on how M\u0101ori see their relationship with their land and their whenua. And I think those are the more important things to focus on with respect to any change in our district plan regarding papak\u0101inga. Because papak\u0101inga is not about the institution,  as it was viewed at the time when we did the district plan back in 1990, 91, 92, whenever it was. Papak\u0101inga are a right that M\u0101ori, mana whenua, are saying is theirs by right. Like any other person in New Zealand, the land that you own, you're allowed to build on. But M\u0101ori-owned land in this circumstance, we're not allowed to build on it.  We don't have the same rights as everyone else has, and these things have not been traversed until very recently. NKTR, for example, has been since 2018 trying to create a public hiring initiative for the Waiapae District Council and the other council areas adjacent to it.  And we've struggled against barrier after barrier ever since then, right up until today, and didn't very aware of those issues that we're trying to address. Even to the point where we're able to get a mitigation fund to allow that to happen, we still have not been able to draw down on that fund, some three or four years later. So these are,  what's called systemic issues that are inhibiting or obstructing our capacity to go and build houses for our people on our land. And I think that's the primary focus that any change for Papak\u0101inga and the district should be. I see the reference to what they did in the Waikato district. Well, that was a far bet. They defaulted to the M\u0101ori Land Court  so that they didn't have to make the decisions, the hard decisions that I'm talking about right now. And I would expect WIPA, along with us, to sit down and find a way that we can do it together. And I'll give you an example of my confidence in WIPA to do this. When we attended and opposed the Waikete expansion in the Environment Court, I went there and I involved  the Waipa District Council is my ally to be able to provide for the mitigation of the impact of the Waikare build on affordable housing in the district. The difficulty in that was that our plan didn't allow us to be able to do the things we wanted to do with that money that was provided for that to happen. And today we're still sitting here trying to work out how the hell are we going to build some homes for our people?  It's now too late. The opportunity we had is gone. We've missed that opportunity because of these inadequacies that the district plan created, not only the district plan, the process itself created for our people to be able to be in affordable housing today. The only public hunger project that occurred within the Waipa District Council area was nothing more than  standard subdivision application. And that cost them over $80,000. Well, our people can't afford to do that every time they want to build a house on their lands. And we have, south of the Pune River, hundreds and hundreds of acres of M\u0101ori land. So in the small area that Waipae has south of the Pune River, we expect to use a lot of those lands  build houses for our people, but we can't. That is the problem with our district plan at the moment. So this public housing initiative is something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm really pleased that it's now come to the forefront. But as far as I'm concerned, we're not going to be copying what Waikato did, because it's totally inappropriate.  It's totally inappropriate because it does not recognize the ownership of individuals of their right to build on their land. And it defers to the M\u0101ori Land Court, which is nothing more than a process to ensure compliance with whatever it was that created it in the first place.  So I just wanted to put that on the table so that we can move forward with a focus, a clear focus on what public hauna actually means. And I think we can do it in Waipa because we've been along that pathway for quite some time and we didn't fully understand it, neither did I at the time. But I have a clearer picture now because the focus has been able to be put into effect by initiatives  that we created out of the Twin Kaukati Housing Network Initiative. So I just wanted to put that on the table, Mr. Mayor, for consideration of council and our people as well. Now, with respect to the Para Wairohui to announce this, I think the idea is good. But let's be very clear about this. You have up to five  separate iwi in your district. Each one is of its own authority. Each one is of its own customary requirements. Even though there are similarities within how they do things, each one has its own authority to do it in their own way. So bringing everyone together in a single place is not going to give you the answers.  It's not going to provide you with what you need to get down to the root cause and the root process of how we can do this right throughout your district. Waip\u0101 is probably one of the harder districts in the country to achieve all the initiatives for the separate M\u0101ori entities that are in there. You've got Waikato, you've got Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101, you've got Kahukura, you've got Raukawa, you've got Maniapoto, you've got Apakura,  And that's only the ones that I can read off the top of my head. So I think we need to be very cognizant of who we are dealing with within Waip\u0101 with respect to Papak\u0101ina. Because no two areas will be the same. We're not the same as how they did theirs in Waikato. The lands that we own here on south of the Punia were never ever taken away from us. The Waikato lands were confiscated and they were given back.  So there was nothing more than you can buy land now in Waikato and you can designate that M\u0101ori land. It's not quite the same thing as the ancestral land that is still in our retention. Now, we're not the only ones like that. There are other iwi tribal groups within Waikato that have that same status. So I'll just put that on the table as information for everyone to consider. Thank you, Mr. Mayor.",

And look, I suppose in some ways this housing crisis that we've got is actually focusing people's minds, thank heavens. So I acknowledge your frustration and we really have, as a country, got to get on top of the lack of housing.  If we can get some focus on these discussions and move forward as quickly as possible, because it's not going to be a short fix to provide housing for the people that need it.  And land, of course, is a significant portion of the costs of doing any development now. So look, we've got to work together to get this over the line, and we really can't afford to be wasting any time. So Julie, I think if you can take that message away from here, that it's really important to keep the pressure on this one, because any opportunity that we can look at to develop housing for people is critical.  But Harold, I just would make a comment and I appreciate the difficulties that we have in Waip\u0101. We still do have to recognise the importance of land for the productive capacity as well. So there's always that balancing act. But look, I fully support the issue in terms of moving forward as quickly as we can to make provision for Papak\u0101inga housing. So thanks for your comments.

    "text": " five cent worth. So me and a few friends did an assessment tool up against what the Waipaea District Council actually has about papak\u0101inga. And so we looked at, we used a kind of a tool assessment about where you can build a papak\u0101inga and where you can't build a papak\u0101inga and the tikanga that it impacts. And so  You can put a house literally wherever you want to do, but it's the M\u0101ori practices that goes on within that papakainga is what is in question when you put it up against the Waip\u0101titi Council. It's what we can do and we can't do there because your bylaws say that you can't. Your bylaws say that you can't once you reach a certain decibel and a sound,  somebody will come and turn your power off. And I've always used this example because it's the truth. Because actually in a papak\u0101inga, sometimes we take our loved ones home. And sometimes we do things at night time that the common community don't do at night time. It's those kind of things that we're wanting to do. And how do you do that with a district plan?  How are we allowed to live and play in our own community, within our own papakainga, regardless of where it is?",

That's the reason for noise controls and everything else. So, and look, I can't believe that the noise issues would be necessarily a problem for Papak\u0101inga.  in a residential area, but certainly those rules are in place so that everyone can  I suppose, take advantage and take enjoyment out of their place that they live. So the idea of separating out non or incompatible uses is, I suppose, the forefront of planning. But look, we've got to be able to work a way around this and get some,  decent housing built for people in the most cost effective way. And that's really what we've all got to focus on. And we can work around some of those other issues about the technical side of things, whether the decibel level is right or wrong. But we've got to have some way of working through those issues. Otherwise, we're just going to be spinning our wheels, as Harold has said, for years and not move anywhere.",

And the last time I was before you was the 1st of June, I think it was, 2nd of June, beg your pardon.  And since then, in July, we've completed stage one. And stage one was simply completing a bunch of technical reports, background technical reports. And then the other important bit of work that followed that was really coming up with a project plan for stage two. And you might remember talking about stage two. Stage two is really the plan itself. So this is where we get to grips with preparing the plan itself.  And that's the key component of the work now. There's been a lot of talk with other reports in terms of the impact of the lockdown. We've yet to see how this impacts projects like this, but I imagine there will be knock-on effects. So hopefully not too severe, but we are at this stage aiming to complete stage two, start it next month and complete it  in October next year. So a quick, not a lot of time and a quick turnaround on that and lots to do. I'm gonna hand over to Kirstie, unless there are any questions on stage one. No, thanks, David.",

    "text": "Kia ora. Thank you, Vanessa. So just in regard to phase two, we're building on the work that was undertaken in phase one, which was around looking at what was happening at a national level, sub-regional level, and locally in terms of central government legislation and regulation policies, strategies, plans.  So gathering all of that information together for us to identify really where we need to focus for growing the future Waip\u0101 and also look at where we've got gaps and challenges, opportunities.  So at the end of phase one, we had developed a project plan and a communication strategy. You may recall when we've reported earlier that we had engaged Stephen Wilson to assist us in terms of guiding us through engagement with mana whenua and iwi.  and you know that he has been incredibly unwell. So I guess to try and ensure that there was some level of engagement whilst he was unavailable to assist us, we've provided updates to this committee and also to Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dpou.  Moving forward, we are wanting to engage in a meaningful way. So the focus of phase two really is around developing possible future scenarios for our communities, testing those, and then developing the substantive plan.  The project control group that you questioned us about, Bill, and that David spoke to, that's really a group that is to provide oversight for this project moving forward, to provide direction and decision-making. Ultimately, decision-making power sits with council as a whole, but this group has been formed to try and provide direction and check-in points as we go along the way.  So on that group, we have the Mayor, Mayor Jim, Deputy Mayor Liz, and Councillor Susan O'Regan as chair of the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee. We have Gary Diet as the project sponsor, myself as the project owner. And we were hoping that we would have mana whenua iwi representation on that group also.  So whilst we were in that interim period and we'd had discussions, but we haven't had mandated representatives feedback to us, Stephen did sit on one of those meetings and was helping to inform the material that was presented to that group. That group has met twice.  initially to provide approval for the material that was workshopped with elected members and has been shared with you, and more recently, a couple of weeks ago, to provide approval for the project plan and the communication strategy.  Outside of that, we were also, we'd engaged Stephen to prepare an engagement plan for mana whenua iwi, and that has just been put in a holding pattern whilst he's been unwell. So, as I mentioned,  Vanessa will be project managing this project, supported by David as an internal technical lead. And we've gone out to procure some external support also. So those requests for proposals have been received and an assessment panel is just working through those. We had a meeting earlier this week and have a follow-up meeting today.  where we will make decisions about who we will be bringing in to provide some external support in terms of that technical work, technical planning and GIS work. I've also had a conversation with Stephen about  how he is and whether there is any availability on his part to assist us as we progress through phase two. So certainly information has been shared with him and we are having that dialogue.  Moving forward, we're proposing that we will provide regular updates through this committee and also through Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b, but we would also like to have a conversation about how else we engage. And there was some discussion  around possibly having some hui out at marae or in the local community within each part of the district. So those are things that we want to progress.  We've had some conversations with the internal strategic partnerships team about how best we seek some guidance as to mana whenua iwi representation, but happy to take questions from you or to provide any further clarification that you might need. And certainly,  As those decisions are made around procurement, then we want to be as open and transparent with you in terms of sharing information as we can be. Thanks, Kirsty.",

I note that you talk about this committee as being a decision-making committee. That will be difficult for mana whenua and iwi.

Likewise, representation on this project committee should have that understanding as well, that they would need to go back to mana whenua and iwi.  in terms of any decisions that are looking to be made by the project group going forward. Just another query was, if we had, I know that I talked earlier about the equity in terms of human resources, but if we had more than two people, because Gary has talked to us at Ng\u0101iwi T\u014dp\u016b about  the possibility of participation in this area.

And I'm really thankful of your recognition of that. I totally support the recommendation or the suggestion that you just made. I'll make that a recommendation if you like. It should be, at least as a minimum, those  separate, one rep from each of those separate authorities, or mana whenua groups, so that they can firstly, for Waipae, have this collective discussion around the benefits for the wider community, and secondly, to assist you to be able to follow and tune down  those idiosyncrasies of each tribal entity in their particular area. And that will be quite an amazing help to be able to focus your spatial plan initiative in its right  components, and I'm only talking for the M\u0101ori communities within Wait\u0101, how you, I have no doubt that you'll actually consider the other communities in an appropriate manner as well. So this is just my suggestion. Thanks.",

And it's from there that we make a nomination for representatives to attend to whatever other committees that council has, and to report back to us collectively. That, I think, is probably the more efficient way to do it.  But that's something that I'm going to have to ask my members about. But they may decide, no, no, we've got the time available. We'll take full account of our own speed.  As Gaelian says, that's their choice. We can't make that decision here. So I think in the first instance, it should be a discussion that we should have as the collective mana whenua that we talk with. And from there, we might get a better steer around the dynamics of what we are dealing with. I don't see this as a topic that our people will be clamouring into, sit down and discuss.  Only those people that are IT or spatial focused would appreciate what that actually means.  And I don't think there's many people around in our community that actually understands it fully either. So I think we're just going to have to manage the collectivity, probably a bit better way to do it. Just a comment on that.

    "text": "Good morning. It's just me on my own today, no Graham.  We've got in your agenda a report on the representation review 2021. We just launched the consultation on that on Friday. As you're aware, we adopted the M\u0101ori ward on the 19th of May, so that means a representation review is now compulsory. So as part of that review, we need to look at how many councillors we have, what areas they cover,  look at whether we want community boards or not, and also look at the M\u0101ori ward. So representation reviews are quite a process. We're just at the, in terms of the very start with our consultation with the community, we adopted an initial proposal, which is,  on the 17th of August at Finance and Corporate. And so that goes out to the community now for just over a month. The community have time to have input. We then have hearings. And then after those hearings, the council will adopt a final proposal. And then actually we go back out again. And then if anyone else has got any issues in terms of what council adopted as its final proposal,  then they can make an appeal or an objection and then the matter actually goes to the local government commission to decide. So we've done a few, there's a few changes that we have made with this representation review. So what we've done is we've actually, in terms of the councillor numbers, they have decreased. So we've gone down from 13 to 10 general ward councillors plus the M\u0101ori ward councillor.  We've looked at how our rural wards are structured. As part of the representational review, we've got to make sure that all the councillors represent kind of more or less the same amount of people. So we have some issues in terms of trying to juggle our urban and our rural wards.  because we have some of our urban wards like Cambridge that are growing at quite a rate. So what we've done there is we have looked at how we structure the rural wards. So we've ended up combining what was the Prongea Ward and the Kakapuku Rural Ward together into one ward. They're both areas that looked to Te Amuru as a service centre.  And then in terms of over the other side of the district, we've extended the Mangatauturi Ward around to include Kaipake. So there will be a number of people that will be in slightly different wards under this proposal. We have left the community boards in a very similar position to the community boards  what they are now, really the only change with them is that in the Cambridge subdivision, they dropped down from five to four. There are some minor changes that have been made to the urban wards to just accommodate where we think future growth might be happening as well.  So in terms of the M\u0101ori ward, the legislation sets out for us how many M\u0101ori ward members we can have and that really impacts on how, for us particularly,  in terms of our numbers, we're only eligible for one. And because we're only eligible for one under the calculation in the legislation, that means that it needs to be over the entire district. So we have, that's what we've had to go with. So really the only variable in terms of this representation review  in relation to the M\u0101ori ward is the name of that ward. So as staff, we worked with the strategic partnerships team to come up with a proposed name for the ward, and we took that through council as part of  the initial proposal when that was adopted and it is, you'll see in your paper there, the name that's been selected is Waipou M\u0101ori Ward. So really the purpose of today is to get any feedback that the committee might have on that and anything else that they wanna talk about in terms of the proposal that's in your agenda.  Has anyone got any comments? Thanks, Joe.",

Marae raised it again with me at a recent meeting I had with Waikato Tainui. And when it was raised, I did say, well, you know, is it possible under legislation? And I was given a clear understanding it is certainly possible under legislation.  So, yeah, I'm raising it as a, you know, to some extent as a K\u0101nohi rep, but also someone that sits inside Apakura, which also sits inside Waikato-Tainui.",

    "text": "Yeah, thanks. That was interesting. I'm not very familiar at all with the electoral process for local authorities.  And I learned something new today, and I didn't realize that the election at large was an option at all. It resonates with me because that's one of the options that provides for a more equitable relationship anyway. But what I wanted to talk about was a view on the name of the M\u0101ori ward. I think you've called it the Waik\u0101 M\u0101ori Ward.  I'd like to suggest that it should be called the Waip\u0101wh\u0101nui ward. I want to take the word M\u0101ori out of it. Now, if you look at how you've described the other wards, European wards are not called P\u0101keh\u0101 wards, they're called general wards. So why are we calling this a M\u0101ori ward when there's a term that can represent that principle and the term is wh\u0101nui?  the Waip\u0101-wide ward. And while listening to you, I thought, well, the election at large principle can fit into that concept like a glove. So I want to put that on the table that I'd recommend we call it the Waip\u0101 Wh\u0101nui Ward and take the term M\u0101ori out of it.  I don't know why it's in there, because it's only Martin can go for it. As long as we hold those racial implications of why we're doing things in our definitions of them, that will always be a barrier to our relationship.  So we have to start being proactive around taking out those nuances that create that negativity because it becomes a focus point, but it's unnecessary for our relationship. So I'd recommend that we change the name to Ani Ward. Now that's just my view on how I think we could go forward on this rather than just calling it the Waip\u0101 M\u0101ori Ward. Thank you, Jim.",

No one even considered giving another name at that point. So the focus was to create M\u0101ori-specific wards in the country, and everyone responded on that basis. However,  There's no reason why the definition of the Waip\u0101wh\u0101nui ward will not have in it that only people who can vote in here are M\u0101ori. Because it'll have to have that as an explanatory requirement for the definition of that ward. Exactly the same as every other ward has. It has a definition on who can vote in it and who cannot. So there's no reason whatsoever why this shouldn't have the, well,  There's every reason why this should have exactly the same sort of thing, but the definition is that a M\u0101ori ward created for M\u0101ori only to vote in. And that provides for what Bill is talking about, that was our purpose of putting the submissions in for a M\u0101ori ward, because that's the only term we had. It didn't mean to say that it was always going to be the name of it, in my view anyway.  So I'm happy to put that on the table if anyone wants to discuss and support it.

Plan A being to see whether we could incorporate the council  reserve into the management of the DOC reserve as well and basically adopt those rules. So our community services team have had a meeting with DOC and I think  Ngati Unu have also met with DOC. Shane, you might want to comment on that with your other hat on. And there was going to be some more discussion at a w\u0101nanga on the 28th of September, whether that proceeds or not. So plan A, well, in terms of DOC taking over that responsibility for Kakapuku,  is still in train, still seeing what we can do there. However, Carl has also instituted a review of the policy as a plan B of the DOG policy. So he's looking at what changes we'd have to, obviously we'd have to review the whole policy. So he's looking at what changes might be required across the district. And he's working on that at the moment.  And yeah, so that will take a while to get through and it would be into next year before we can bring that before council anyway. So that's both tranches of that are proceeding at the moment.
