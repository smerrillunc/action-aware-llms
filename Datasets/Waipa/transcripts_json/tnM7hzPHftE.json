I know that that's one of the purposes of the Gambling Act is to facilitate community participation in deciding how gambling takes place in our district. So I think the work that you've done following our first meeting on this has been really good. There's been a good level of engagement and it has obviously facilitated that community input.  So I'm very keen that we have a really decent debate on this today. We've got 40 minutes on this and we're already ahead of schedule, so we have a decent amount of time. And yeah, I would really like us to debate this issue from all angles to sort of critically test the arguments for and against.  the continuation of our policy or a change to our policy. And then ultimately, we do have to make a decision today about whether it's our gambling policy and status quo, or whether we're putting it up for amendment. Okay. So,  The resolution you'll see is in essentially two parts. There's A, B, and C, that we receive Mika's report, that we acknowledge that the review is taking place as required, and that we receive the result of the initial community engagement that we have in front of us. So the suggestion is that we take A, B, and C, those resolutions now.  And then the decision point, the either or, we will debate that and conclude with the decision point, okay? So if we could have a mover and a seconder for A, B, and C, and that's Claire and Susan. Is everyone in favour of that? Please say aye. Aye. Against? Carried. Okay, great. And now the,  options before us, the clear decision point, whether we do or do not review our gambling policy. So I'm going to open up there. We've got plenty of time to hear from everyone.

I think one of the things that comes out of this to me is the fact that historically over the last number of years, we've actually had a cap on the number of machines. And the projection is, sorry, the history is that we have as a district grown in population quite considerably.  And although there might be a little bit of a lull, the long-term projection is that we continue to increase our population. So effectively, if we keep the current cap as is on the number of machines, then the effective number of machines per thousand population  is actually in any way going to reduce. So although it's not reducing the number of machines, it's actually reducing the average number of machines per person. So it is in a way a control mechanism in itself.  to make the number of machines controllable. So I'm in favour of saying, let's keep the number of machines at its current number and allow the population growth to effectively reduce our per capita. So that's, I think, where I'm sitting.

There's really pretty, to my mind, sound arguments on both sides.  On the one hand, there is no doubt that gambling, whether it be these machines or online or whatever, does create harm in some of our community. But then lots of things do. You know, should we stop elderly women from riding pushbikes on the timber trail?  which, you know, I right at the moment would be in favour of because my wife broke her collarbone on Friday. And yes, she did. And it's a pain in the backside to be more regular. And she's in a lot of pain and all the rest of it. But I mean, we're clearly not going to do that. So I guess what I'm saying is,  activities can cause harm to sectors of our community but do we take away the ability to for people to make up their own minds about doing stuff because lots of people do use these things with no harm to themselves or their families and get some  entertainment and leisure. So, you know, my argument was a bit facetious, I'll grant that. But, yeah, there are both sides to the equation. I think one of the things that does not sit well with me is the numbers show that the more deprived members of our community use them  more and the funds tend to go to sectors that probably don't really need them as much. There's arguments there too. I mean, most sports clubs and a lot of them do benefit, cater for the whole gamut of socioeconomic groups. But yeah, so look, I'm interested to hear more people  put some arguments forward because I'm really sitting on the fence on this one at the moment. Roger.",

I think, however, that in today's technological era, there are so many other opportunities for people to engage in gambling that are actually easier.  for them to get into. I mean, the number of international gaming software programs that you can get on your phone quite readily that are probably easier to do than walking down a couple of blocks to the local outlet for the pen machines. I think those people that are attracted to gaming  the number of them that have actually TAB accounts on their phone and things of that nature. I don't see that actually addressing one particular supply of that kind of entertainment is going to affect the overall accessibility of that form of gaming. It's there, it's out there. I just think that in fact, the one  style that we're talking about, which is the venue and the commercial operators, there is in fact, in that regard, some benefit coming back to the community to counteract that. So I'm just wondering whether actually doing anything to the current supply of machines is going to have any impact on the readily available access to gaming.",

A concern I have with that argument that I haven't been able to find an answer on is that to access that online stuff, you basically have to have a credit card because you're dealing in foreign funds. Whereas going down to the pokies at your local pub, you're just using cash. It's pretty much a human right in New Zealand to have a bank account, but it's not to have a credit card. So if you're beginning to get in trouble, one of the first things that  you know, you lose access to as your credit cards, you max them out. And so this argument is often raised that it's just a risk of leakage and we might as well keep it in our district and benefit from the funds. Does anyone have an answer on that? Is there a difference from the online stuff, which requires a credit card? Yeah. And the domestic stuff at your local pub, which is just cash.",

So was able to be part of forums and groups with Hamilton City Council around gambling effects within our community. And I'm sure if anyone's aware of how Fairfield is, in Enderley, we have some real challenges over that side of Hamilton City.  Well, what I would say to this is that even if we restricted the amount of machines in our district, people will still go and find that machine that they want to put their money in regardless. They will find that machine because there is an addiction to these types of activities. So I kind of don't call them leisurely type of activities anymore.  The other thing is too, is I kind of, I do agree with what Monty's saying because with low socioeconomic families that do have problems with this sort of stuff, you must have Wi-Fi access and you must have minutes on your phone if you don't have Wi-Fi access to access these sites overseas to do the gambling. And yes, you need a credit card. Many of them only have a debit card. They won't have a credit card.  I'm still part of some of these forums, and Hamilton is my give back to a couple of things. So I'm of the kind of more that we would take a sinking lid policy, because no matter what, people that go and want to do this will go and find the machine to do it, regardless of whether we limit them or whatever we do.  And I think there's quite a bit of evidence out there to see how much gambling can have an effect in our area. So yeah, I'm keen for us to have a huge as debate on this, but I do know that families that do struggle, that are part of being engaged in this type of activity,  They do need minutes, they do need Wi-Fi. They don't actually access as much online as what they do in person.

OK, so.  how much pokies contribute to gambling harm. That's one part of the debate. The second part of the debate is around the recycling of the funds. I don't think anyone would have a problem about where the gaming trusts are redistributing their funds back into our communities.

But the question,  that I want us to wrestle with is, is it ethical that we allow pokies to be dangled in front of our more vulnerable communities when there's a reasonably clear redistribution of those funds away from the more vulnerable towards the rest? Is that sort of an ethically defensible position?  I sort of, if I personalize this argument, I never come across a pokey machine, OK? They are nowhere that I go, and I would never put a cent in them, OK? And none of my friends go anywhere that they are.  but I know where they are and is it fair? It's almost a social justice question to me. Is this fair that we allow these to be dangled in front of our more economically deprived communities when I'm not subject to the same temptation because they're simply not places I go?  So the two questions there that I'd like us to chuck around, the gambling harm one and the social justice issues around the redistribution of wealth.",

    "text": "Yeah, thanks, Monty. I think you make some really strong points. And yeah, I guess there is an ethical question at stake here. I do take a broader view.  in that there are lots of things that are dangled in front of people that are susceptible to these things that probably make them make bad financial choices that then, you know, impact them in other ways in their wh\u0101nau. I mean, alcohol is one of them, okay? And yet I don't see a call to, you know, reduce the number of outlets or the availability of alcohol in that way. So I'm trying to sort of  keep some perspective and also do, I disagree on a certain level with the redistribution as well, that it's away from that socioeconomic group to another socioeconomic group and there's no way that that original group benefits because I read that huge list of grants and I know that a lot of kids want to play sports  I think the message that came through those submissions was that if they didn't get this money to support their operations, kids wouldn't be able to play sport. And that, in fact, it was a lifeline. If this money wasn't there, they don't know if they would continue as well. So I guess  Yeah, there's not that clear line that you sort of suggested. I do think it's pretty murky, actually. There's a lot of grey areas. And I was thinking deeply about this over the weekend because I also don't want to be responsible for, I suppose, that level of harm that you've sort of alluded to. However, if it's that harmful, we should be saying to the government, you should be banning these. Okay, so why are you expecting  that Waip\u0101 should have to take a stand and say, right, sinking lid for us, but everyone else can, you know, do what they like. Like, I think we should be saying, look, if they are that harmful, they should be banned. And in the meantime, you know, we have got an effective sinking lid because we've got quite a lot of growth. And in fact, the increase has, that cap's been in place for quite a long time. And there's no evidence also that  reducing the supply actually reduces the spend. So if I was going to take quite a, I do feel it's quite an extreme step actually to go to sinking lid when an actual fact is probably not going to make a blind bit of difference. So on the one hand, I've got, that's an option, but is it going to improve things for the people we want to see protected? And if we did do that,  what's going to be the effect on the positive side, you know? Yeah, so I wasn't, I am also very pleased to see that there's a lot of more, I suppose, legislative protection that's coming through, like, that wasn't reflected in the material we got, because it was, you know, something that has changed since then, you know, those  venue rules, yeah, those practices that they have to be putting in place. And there was a really good submission there from Grassroots about their commitment to minimizing harm. And they're saying that they've got facial recognition technology in all but one of their venues. I know they're not the only licensee or the only operator, but I think that there's a recognition that this needs to be managed well.  And so, yeah, so I suppose shortcutting to where I'm sitting, yeah, I'm not in favour of a sinking lid at this point. I think that the controls we have over availability, I think are reasonable. I'm also, and I think that we've got to make sure that those support services and yeah, that kind of thing, that they are really effective  I'd be interested in a bit more work on that, actually. Yeah. And, you know, there were figures there of the actual number of people that are presenting and seeking help. I think there was one new person in the last 12 months. So that said for me that actually, I think the controls are reasonably effective. Not wanting to discount  yeah, the harm, but just, you know, overall, yeah, I think that's where I'm sitting anyway. Thanks, Clare. We're going to go to Liz, then Roger, then Mike.",

    "text": "Thank you, everyone. Hopefully you can hear me OK. Hey, look, I guess, again, I have been giving this a great deal of thought over the last few months.  and probably sit very closely to where Claire and Roger's thoughts are. And yeah, I just did want to correct some of the information I heard earlier, because I also understand that grassroots have, in all of the Waip\u0101 venues, except one facial recognition.  So for me, that does provide me with quite a bit of comfort. I understand how it works is that staff are sent an alert to the front of house. So yeah, so for me, there is, I guess, some, you know, kind of in a back of house monitoring going on, which I think is actually really important. I also understand, you know, it's three to $4 million that each year is, you know, spent on harm prevention.  So I guess this is a concern nationally, and I'd like to think that amongst all those organizations, they are continuing to put pressure on each facility so that they are monitoring their customers on a reasonably regular basis as well. Yeah, in terms of the sinking lid versus the cap, yeah, I guess the cap for me has always provided me with a great deal of comfort  knowing that as we're growing, so we're going to essentially sort of continue to see a limit on the number of machines across our district anyway. So with our current growth projections, I'm really comfortable with a cap and probably that's sitting at the moment.  I also look at, you know, many of my friends, actually, who actually do play pokey machines. So, Monty, you and I have different friends, so that's not in a negative way at all. But for me, a lot of people that I know in Cambridge use machines as a social activity. Some of them are  you know, they are retired, they have the funds, and they thoroughly enjoy, you know, going into town and using them. So for them, people I know anyway, they use it as their, you know, as I said, their social activity. And again, as Claire said, when I look at the huge list there of younger sporting organizations that do obviously receive funds  I know many of them would, you know, probably wouldn't be playing if they just couldn't have those new jerseys that they do get on an annual basis. They are often, you know, many of those sporting groups simply couldn't probably afford that. Now, I do absolutely see a number of other sort of premium sports that are receiving a great deal of funding as well, but I'd also like to thank particularly Cross and Waip\u0101 that, you know,  you know, the benefits, I suppose, that I see with high-performance sport and how it spreads through our community, through eventing, but also, you know, the great deal of pride that we have in some of our high-performance athletes, that it does sort of filter down, and our town is prosperous, and that filters down to employment opportunities as well. So, yeah, that's probably where I'm sitting on this issue right now, is to probably keep the cap. So, thank you. Hopefully you can all hear me.",

But I'd like to perhaps expand Claire's point on the perception of the organisations that do benefit from this in this negative redistribution of wealth that you perhaps referred to, Mr Chair.  I, as you know, I'm a member of a number of not-for-profit organisations within the community, and one of those is actually Destination Cambridge, and Destination Cambridge actually gets the major portion of its funding for the Christmas parade in Cambridge from  one of these pokey machine organisations. And in fact, if it weren't to receive that cash injection, then there would be a question over whether or not we would have a Christmas parade in  in Cambridge. And I think that Christmas parade is to the benefit of all of the community across everyone. Another sector, again, a not-for-profit that I'm a member of that does, in fact, I was a member of, sorry, no longer, is Riding for the Disabled. And again, that received funding for some of their activities. And that's, of course, for a disadvantaged  sector of our community. So, it's not just the sports organisations that get the benefit of funding, it's through other sectors as well. So, I just thought I'd like to expand that perception of the benefits. Thanks, Roger.

    "text": "Yeah, thank you, through the chair. Good morning to everyone. Yeah, so, yeah, we've all been thinking about this, I'm sure, for quite some time.  And first, I would just like to congratulate who put this together, because there's a lot of really good data in here and well done for the questions that were so well answered by our community, because I think we did get a, we got a steer from our community, which may or may not go through the decision that we make here today. But, you know, the overall  feedback from the community is the sinking lid option was what they desired, if you look at the percentages. But of course, the survey doesn't cover everything. And so just a few points, I've sort of got out of all the data that was there, is that at one point it sort of stated that 0.2% of people who use these type of machines or activities become problem gamblers.  The money that the gambling establishments have to put aside as a whole is 1.08 percent, which is substantially more than the sort of problem gambling percentage. And of that, I believe there's about $20 million in this trust or in this fund to actually help those folks with problem gambling. There's also that 365-day, 24-hour  helpline, of which there's also special helplines for Pasifika, for M\u0101ori, and I think for Asian populations. So they have done something above and extra there, and I guess that's based on data that they would have. I'm sure that's why they've identified those populations, I can only imagine. And it is this good versus harm. And  I'm not going to say the actual submission, but one of the submissions in there was from a charitable group, and they sort of stated  You know, like, they understand the problems, which we all understand that this can create, but for a very small population. But also, the benefits for them to so much outweigh what they do with this money, with their group, who are out there helping society, far outweighs that 0.2%, or as Claire said, the one extra person, or the four people that are currently on the books, or whatever those small numbers are year to year.  So I sort of really, I sort of, to steal Liz's word, took comfort in that. The other thing is, is this controlled over uncontrolled? I guess that's why we have speed limits, you know, controls in society, is that there's a reason for control, and if you take control away, it probably leads to  Well, it just leads to poorer outcomes, you know, whether it be speed limits, or whether it be alcohol, or whether it be smoking age, and you sort of see it with, well, to a degree with vaping at the moment, you know, though there is an age which probably like it to be older, but  But this control over uncontrolling, I guess that online stuff is uncontrolled. Though, Monty, I pick up your point about you have to have credit cards, etc, etc. But if you want something, you'll always find a way to get around something. And so I do favour this controlled, and I really like the work that grassroots are doing. And I think that, hey, others out there that are listening to this,  You folks need to stand up and get on board with this technology. It's obviously there. And the challenge, I guess, from me to you would be to spend the money and to implement this and upskill your staff as quick as you can, because it's just another little deterrent and another control.  So, I am sitting and I was on the fence over the last month or two, but the more I've read, I'm actually comfortable with the status quo of where Waip\u0101 Council sits with this policy at present. I think the feedback from the community was so good that  What we're going to do is regurgitate the same type of messages, whether strong or weaker. I don't think we're going to get too much more out of it. And again, I just thank the folks that have submitted and have taken a lot of time and effort to actually make very substantial submissions. So, yeah, that's all I've got to say for now. Thank you.",

    "text": "Kia ora tatou.  Look, I've been really heartened by the community sentiment and concern regarding the impact of problem gambling in our community that's come from this pre-engagement. I think it really shows heart and genuine concern in our communities for a group who can be considered, quite frankly, as the most vulnerable members of our community. And that gives me heart that we've got people here who are concerned to see that and want to voice that concern.  That concern and the resulting support, however, for a sinking lid, although commendable, actually becomes unstuck when you actually accept that there's clear evidence, both nationally and internationally, that research confirms a sinking lid policy doesn't reduce problem gambling. And you've got to look at the data there and you've got to understand that commendable as the notion is, unless you rid us of every single machine in the country, it's just, there is no impact.  So I guess to the points earlier made around online gambling, to me, that seems the biggest sleeping giant. There's some phenomenal migration onto online gambling services and massive funds of money going out of the country through that mechanism.  So I guess I'd quite like to focus our energies as much as we can on lobbying central government for strengthening restrictions in that space. I think that would be a really good use of our energy. I also really want to acknowledge that there is, in essence, a de facto sinking lead anyway, as Roger has mentioned and Clare's touched on, by virtue of our growing population.  So in essence, we're getting that anyway. I guess it's, I mean, there are so many sides and we've all kind of, I think every single one of us around this table at one minute has been very strongly opposed or very strongly supportive of a change either way, and then probably changed in the same sentence, to be quite frank.  Look, it seems to me that my position is kind of summarised by one of the submitters, which is a charitable group in there, and I won't name them, but they've said there's no perfect model. And I think that's a really perfect kind of way of summarising it. And they've gone on to say that the benefits far outweigh the negative impacts there are.  And there are little to no alternatives available for community groups, such as charities, clubs, involved in the arts, social services, what have you, in order to sustain a lot of their activity. And I guess it's really, really hard for us to ignore that sizable funding that goes into those community groups. And it would be really remiss of us to be blind  to the role that they play in the positive health and well-being for our communities. So I guess I ask myself, what would our district look like without those groups? Because a lot of them have pretty clearly said in black and white in these submissions, it would be game over for them. And I guess those are the groups that are the glue of our communities. They're run by volunteers.  and they're the very fabric of what makes Waipara a really cool place. So I guess it's a huge moral conundrum for us all. None of us are blind to the harms of gambling, but I guess on balance, I don't get the sense that a change would impact at all in terms of those small numbers that are affected.  And I guess the little libertarian in me has a real issue around the agency kind of argument too, but that takes a back seat to the facts around the evidence that a sinking lid will not impact on these issues. But again, I am heartened by the community's concern and their mobilisation and their numbers to respond to this engagement. And thank you staff for being so comprehensive and making sure we get that feedback, it's important.",

If there are no pokies, what does that do to problem gambling? Because the research that you're citing is that sinking lids don't affect problem gambling outcomes. So it's an interesting one.

I guess,  One of the things I've been thinking here is even if there are no popies in New Zealand, there will still be problem gambling. There are other avenues. I'm not saying that it wouldn't be less, I don't know.  And I guess one of the positives, kind of a backhanded positive, is if the DIA measures we're talking about and lobbying of central government that I am fully in favor of, helps identify problem gamblers through the use of poking machines.  that, you know, exposes an issue that may otherwise have stayed unidentified and untreated. Yeah, so, you know, that is the point that I wanted, and kind of, I think, in some way, reflects on the avenues you've raised.

So that's another reason, too, why that relocation strategy, staying in there, to me is actually quite a positive one. And again, that's a challenge to, you know, these organizations of, we all see the benefit, but we all know about where the most harm is, and it's in those most deprived areas. And I guess the challenge to you folk is to,  When the time arises, how can you take your businesses away from these areas, these more deprived areas, into more middle of the road areas, general population areas, where probably more of the funding goes back to anyway?  So yeah, I guess there's some challenges we are issuing. It sounds like this is gonna pass, which I'm comfortable with, but there's some challenges we are throwing back to the industry, and maybe more outside of Waip\u0101 also, where there really are a lot more deprived areas than our deprived areas in Waip\u0101.

There's a couple of things here because you've raised it, Mike, in terms of the effect of gambling on M\u0101ori. And I just wanted to acknowledge in the paper Mika's late engagement with Ng\u0101 Iwi T\u014dp\u016b.  and the way it's been expressed in terms of the outcomes from Ng\u0101iwi t\u014dpu, there wasn't an outcome. There was a great deal of debate, both pro and con, very much like is going on at this table, about the ways in which M\u0101ori also benefit from  grassroots trust in other places. There's also a lot of the schools, you know, we participate in those sports as well. And yeah, as Mika has reported to us as council, there wasn't an outcome from Ng\u0101i W\u012b T\u014dp\u016b. So, you know, I think that that would tend to indicate to me, certainly, that I'd have to go with the status quo as opposed to something that Ng\u0101i W\u012b T\u014dp\u016b was not in favour of.  So you asked about, you know, M\u0101ori's position in this. Well, I totally understand that, yeah, we've been affected by it. And looking at the information that's come back from other engagement, not just in Ng\u0101i W\u012b T\u016bp\u016b, there was a very low turnout for mana whenua in those responses that were given. And I picked that up as well. So, yeah. Thank you again, Mika, for making time available to come back in the late engagement with Ng\u0101i W\u012b T\u016bp\u016b on this.",

Like, could you pick up that there's an anomaly about the way it's calculated? Yeah. And so  actually CBD areas come up as high deprivation areas. I'd just like to put that out to you, Mike, because that's where a lot of our venues are actually located, but it doesn't mean that they're actually in areas here that have got lots of people in the lower socioeconomic echelon, that's all. Yeah, and, you know, also, Monty, your comments about wellbeing, like that is, you know, one of our, I suppose, pillars and things like that.  But does it mean that we identify a problem and just take the most extreme action, even though perhaps that action is known not to be particularly effective? And I'll give you an example to do with the road toll. Okay, so we had at least, you know, that's pretty shocking. We've got people being killed on our roads. So it's not just social harm, it's more than that. But there's no call to limit the number of cars on the road.  because we know actually that's probably not going to, well, actually it might be pretty effective, might be quite effective. But, you know, we do choose the action that we think is probably going to be realistic and make sense for our community. So, you know, I think that we are trying to take a balanced approach here. I mean, I've been really wrapped with  with all the discussion, and I think we can see there's two or even 10 sides to this. Yeah, yeah. And I was pleased, too, that we are discussing those other things, because I wasn't ready to vote, because we haven't talked about the TAB venue, and Roger raised the relocation, too.

These are little organisations like, you know, clubs and schools and social good trusts, et cetera, that are relying on this money. And there's no way, you know, there's no way that we're going back to  to big smoking companies or who knows, vaping companies that are coming online, taking the place of all these little small events. And the Christmas parade was a good one. I mean, it used to be sponsored by New World. So yes, like Dalmarie said, there's definitely avenues for little things like that for communities to get on board. But again, there's only so much that local businesses and philanthropic folk  can actually soak up before they become exhausted. So it's all fine to say, because there's so much money given back by these gambling trusts. So, Monty, your question around our four well-beings and the first three, I actually think this does fit into it, and the reason I guess it does is because, to me, the good far outweighs the bad.

So, this report fell out of a discussion during the gambling policy, I believe it was, when I undertook to provide some comments on where vaping sat with Council from a compliance or regulatory perspective. But certainly in the early stages, it was pretty clear that the report was only confirmed that our involvement in that space is extremely limited and that any options that Council wanted to look at would sit in a wider area than that. So,  I'll take the report as read and acknowledge the number of other staff and Te Wh\u0101tua Ora staff who have assisted because it's sort of moved out of my wheelhouse, so to speak, from a compliance regulatory into a much wider space. So, yeah, I certainly take the report as read and I guess that the key factors, not surprisingly, are summarised in the conclusion.  along with some of the options that council could look at between now and, I guess, the key date being August next year when the existing smoke-free policy is due for review. And that might provide an opportunity to consolidate some of that work a bit more formally. So, yeah, I'll just take it from there.",

So we went to great lengths to ensure that that visibility went away. So look, I completely agree with the conclusions. I think we need to do more. I think this is an absolute epidemic in New Zealand. And I really, really feel strongly that if there's anything more that we can actually do around this, I'd be absolutely supportive around it.

And so it's not a deterrent to do something else. It's just something that they're just going straight into. And that really concerns me.

It's a disaster, particularly in our intermediate, middle and high schools. It's so prevalent that children's health and safety and the educational learning is actually 100 percent being affected in Waipa and throughout the country.  So, one of the things\u2014so, I agree with everything in here, and I agree with recommendations, apart from maybe just specifically us working with those intermediate, middle and high schools, not just setting up a youth council or something like that. But the other thing is I really think we need to get our local MP, Louise Upston, to really get\u2014well, whatever government is next,  but to really address this and at least go to a situation where the Australians have gone to where you cannot actually just legislate, you can't buy the stuff as it can currently be bought. So I think our next step and part of this is to hit up our local MPs, whoever's in government next, and really try and get this pushed through as an amendment to the current legislation. I think that's probably our best, most decisive next move. And through LG,  Was it LGNZ? What's it called? LGNZ or whatever.

But again, I think that landlords do have a lot of, they have the ability, I think, to put a little bit of pressure on some of their leases around products that should or shouldn't be potentially sold in there. But hey, as a community, we can even just talk to  perhaps some of the business owners around this as well. I just think that this is very problematic, and I've had some conversations just, you know, obviously I'm overseas at the moment. I don't think this is international. I think this is a New Zealand issue right now. And especially in young youth, it seems that it's not prevalent in Europe. It's not something that young children are doing, but in New Zealand it is, and that's really, really worrying.",

They are a problem for all of us.  And I actually believe that we could actually ask these retailers to actually comply with the regulations, certainly have the removable battery, but also have this product that will be disposable, that we can get rid of it. But I think we can challenge them very much on this. I'm very much against vaping. I feel it's very addictive. My one daughter is a college teacher.  and she'll tell you it's endemic. I agree with Councillor Pettit on that. And at Te Amiru College, it's really endemic at the time. So I believe that perhaps we look at something that laws that we can actually change and make affect. Also, would we approach our MPs to do what they did with tobacco and put up a tax as they did with tobacco? This is something, okay, to make it less attractive financially, because all of this is actually affecting our society.  I'm really, really quite emphatic about that. Thank you. Thanks, Lou. Susan.",

And I think the government has actually really dropped the ball on this. It came in under the guise of being some kind of therapeutic measure to alleviate  addictions to tobacco and instead has blossomed into this entire new industry, which I don't think is accidental, but that's just my thinking. Look, I'll just give you an update in terms of LGNZ activity around this. I understand at the AGM in 2022, a remit was put by Kaipara and supported by the group asking the government to restrict the sale of vaping products to R18 specialist vape stores.  There was some minimal change made around some legislation at the time, and the remit at the time received extensive coverage in the media. Off the back of that, LGNZ requested a meeting with the Minister of Health to discuss that remit, but due to competing priorities, that meeting hadn't happened. And that's the update as at the most recent AGM.  So that gives you some idea of where it sits, what has sat in the priorities in the Ministry of Health. But look, I circulated to you all an email I received from a young person who's active in anti-vaping circles calling on us to act and lobby central government. I have absolutely no issue with pressing our foot down as hard as we can on those points that are raised there in that email.  and you will have heard it all hit your inbox momentarily a short time ago. So look, and I've given you, sent you the response that I sent to them on that point. So look, I, yeah, just blows my mind, absolutely blows my mind that we've got ourselves into this state. But happy to, as Mayor, advance Waip\u0101's  condemnation of this burgeoning epidemic at Wellington as and or when you see necessary.",

Yeah, but also formally lobby government to actually change the legislation. So sort of a two-pronged approach, but both at the national level. And it may take some time, but that's where, and Mayor Susan, and that's where, when you get around with the mayors, and we can get on the same page here, but far and beyond the R18 thing, that's not a solution.

    "text": " Thank you very much for having me here to speak today. And before I begin, can I just ask who's heard of the Safer Cambridge Trust? A few, okay. And who's heard of Cambridge Neighbourhood Support? A few more, that's good. And who's heard of Cambridge Community Patrol? Scott, very good, okay. Well,  I think it's pretty good, but not really enough. And that's why I'm here to talk to you today, because we believe that there's not a really good awareness of the Safe at Cambridge Trust, as well as Cambridge Neighbourhood Support and the Community Patrol. So I want to talk to you today about who we are, why we're relevant, what we do and what you can do to help us.  So, first of all, I'm Eileen Hawkins and I'm here from the Cambridge Neighbourhood Support. And Cambridge Neighbourhood Support is run by the Safer Cambridge Trust. And the Safer Cambridge Trust has a whole lot of representatives in Cambridge. Obviously, we have a local prominent lawyer, Jocelyn Kearney, who was the coroner. We have Ian Hughes, who was our chair. He represents education. We have Deb Haan from the police. We have  Kelly Bouzade, who is the chair of our Chamber of Commerce. We have a farming representative. So we're trying to be as representative as we can as a trust of the Cambridge community. And Cambridge Neighbourhood Support has three objectives. So the first being connection, and connection we believe underlies everything we do, and I'll tell you why soon. Then we have safety as our second, and we have resilience as our third.  Now, a safe and a connected community will often lead to resilience, but more about that later.  Then we have our community patrol. Now apparently our community patrol is one of the most active community patrols in New Zealand. They're out almost every night until the wee hours of the morning. And they've got really strong connections with the police. So they're talking with them on a daily basis. And they do everything from interrupt drug transactions to securing commercial premises, to finding suspicious people and cars for the police.  and to preventing suicides off our high-level bridge, unfortunately.  So they're very active there in the community as well. So that's who we are. And why are we relevant? Well, we have done the research and I'm just gonna read a bit of research to you because I think this is really significant actually in what we do because the longest running study, Harvard study shows that people who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines in earlier in midlife  and their brain functioning actually declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are well-connected, which means that people who are well-connected actually have longer life with a functioning brain and they live longer. So, you know, our work with connection is really important for the well-being of the community.  But I also know that the council's vision is to partner with communities to promote well-being and also social resilience. So, our goals are very much aligned. And also,  Extra to that, every time we do our strategic planning, which is once a year, we talk about what our community wants. And in order to know that, we run a community survey of our members. And we ask our community, what do you want us to focus on this year, given our three main objectives? And this year, the community has said to us, emergency preparedness is at the top priority for us.  So they've said that's the top priority, yet they've told us that only 10% of our neighbourhood communities feel very prepared to cope in an emergency. So top priority, but not very well prepared. So how have we responded? Well, this year, we've got three very good campaigns going on. The first is our Capable Community Campaign, which some of you may have heard about, where we're getting neighbourhoods together to plan. We're asking,  single households to put forward the kind of skills and equipments that they have in their household, which could be used in an emergency. We're also asking people to note whether they are vulnerable and they may need help in case of an evacuation. And this is all put together in this plan, which may be on the fridge or in their grab and go bag or something like that. And then in case of an emergency, they can look and see  I can go to number nine for first aid treatment. I see number 16 has medical supplies. Over the page here, we've got people who have an independent water supply, people who have a generator, people who have an off-grid toilet, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  So it's a great plan to raise resilience of the neighbourhood. And it's a great plan as it is, but also what happens after people make this plan is that they talk to one another, they form those all needed connections, and then that leads to not only connectedness, but also resilience in the community. I tell you, people love this. You know, they're thanking us for this all the time, and they're really engaging well with it. So we're really happy with that.  Secondly, we're running first aid, subsidized first aid courses at the moment with the help of the Cambridge Community Board have given us some funding. So people are able to take a emergency first aid class for only $35 at the moment. And that's to raise the level of overall safety and resilience in the community as well.  Thirdly, we have a children's citizenship program running at the moment too, where we're urging children, educating children really, about citizenship and how they can contribute to the community. So at a young age, we're trying to instill those thoughts about community in children so that they'll bring that forward as an adult as well.  And of course, we're running our monthly meetings with our rural communities as well, where we go out and we talk to them about, we take our local police officer and also our firearms manager and talk to them about the use of firearms, et cetera, and crime safety tips, et cetera, et cetera. So we're very active on the community. Now, what we'll do next year, of course, depends on funding. And this is where you may be able to help.  As you know, the Cambridge population is rapidly growing and Cambridge is the main growth centre for Waip\u0101, but also crime is growing unfortunately, even in Cambridge. Last year we looked at the stats for Cambridge and we found that crime in Cambridge had grown 14.7% over the preceding three years. So with the  the rise in population and in crime, the impact we are making over that, you know, gets harder and harder. So as a trust, we require 100,000 per year to  try and meet that impact. Otherwise, you know, if that disparity becomes too great, you're not making any impact at all. Of course, we go out and seek funding from all sorts of places and we are seeking sponsorship, et cetera, et cetera. So we're very active in applying for funding here, there and everywhere. But what we need is to lock in some long term funding. And that's because we can only give staff short term contracts at the moment. And that  leads to a bit of insecurity. And when staff leave, of course, then you lose the momentum of the service. And that's happened to us a number of times before. So we're hoping that WIPAR will really think about the true alignment of our goals when WIPAR is thinking about funding for the future.  So to summarise, we are Cambridge Neighbourhood Support and Community Patrol and we are operated by the Cambridge Safer Trust. So if you can remember that Safer Cambridge Trust, that would be great. We're running, we're all about wellbeing and we're all about connection and resilience and safety in the community as is Waip\u0101.  We're currently running some very relevant campaigns that are engaging and the community is thanking us for them all the time, which is great. But we need to lock in funding because we need to keep up the momentum and keep up our impact as we can.  Now, I know that YPAS vision, as I said, is to really partner with community organisations in order to raise the well-being and the social resilience of the community. So what I'm asking you is to really consider how you can truly partner with us and show that partnership in action when you're considering your long-term funding.  So that's all from me. Thanks Eileen. I think I got your name wrong at the beginning.",

They had a little bit of trouble when they were establishing their papak\u0101inga, and also about how we could do some more work in this area.  We spread very thinly. So what I do really is I go out to different communities and I talk to people and try to encourage them and get them on board. And then they become the people who are taking the message forward.

And there is quite demonstrably a need for the level of service that you bring to our community. I don't think there's any doubt in that.  but I understand that you apply to the community board for funding and that has to be an annual application for funds and it's not automatic. And I'm just wondering whether now in terms of the public good and the community benefit that comes from it, that now is the time for us to consider perhaps  making this an allocation within targeted rates.  that we have an amount within targeted rate that obviously depends, it's generated by the number of rate payers that we have in Cambridge. So as the community grows, hence the rating income grows, and we fund the services and the support of an organisation that has so much good. It also means that  If it is a targeted rate, and hence included each year, then there's a sustainability factor of the services because they no longer have to apply on an annual basis. It's something that they can can  manage and count on each year to support their services going forward. So I'm wondering if that's, you know, now is the time that, especially with the increase in crime, that we should maybe look at a targeted rate and I'd be interested in Ken's comments on that.",

So it's really stepping right back to a, I guess, a marae and hap\u016b level. We've had sort of, we do have Ng\u0101i T\u014dp\u016b as an intermediary, PEN, mana whenua group, if you like. We're trying to get right back to those, to the flax roots, if you like, to have those conversations,  to, I guess, refresh the models that we currently have. And so that, I think you've been engaging, Shane, with a number of those, and maybe if you could just give a bit of the highlights of those discussions.",

    "text": " So the discussion so far has been with a number of our marae that are both directly inside the Waipa District Council area and those who sit just outside of the area. Noting too that these were initial conversations with the marae chairs and some of the trustees of various marae.  and engaging with them, the notion of engagement and partnership with council, whatever that might be. Some of the feedback to date has been very clear. Nearly all, well, all that we've spoken to, all the individuals that we've spoken to, give the same feedback. Basically they're a raft of capacity issues.  be able to engage. They spend their lives like we do fully employed, and then the rest of the time is spent trying to maintain their marae as well as progress the hap\u016b that they represent.  That means there's not a lot of time for other considerations. In fact, in many of the discussions, their focus is on maintaining their marae, the buildings, the plumbing and vertical and horizontal infrastructure, as well as being a source of respite and refuge for the hap\u016b.  So there's lots going on there and notable too was that there are many other organisations seeking their attention.  and that is only growing. And so we've seen in the last few decades how that's multiplied through various post-settlement situations and which the Crown has provided means for those iwi who have settled. This has provided  a growth factor, if you like, within marae, there's a growing expectation from external organisations for there to be contact and consultation and so on and so forth. So our marae throughout the entire rohe, across the country, are under pressure  And so these initial conversations with them is to prepare them for more formal conversations around the notion of engagement and partnership, so that they can take the time to reflect on what that might mean for them, given their capacity, given their resources, and given their interest. So that was something that has come through. Now, why would we  partner with or engage with council. And so to that extent, Gary and I will be doing some work this month to pull together all the touch points that we have. And there are numerous touch points that Waipa District Council has with numerous marae, mana whenua bodies. That's the other part to the engagement and the other  key messages that have come through is that it's about a relationship before engagement, before partnership. If the relationship isn't there, then there will be no great engagement and partnership going forward.  And what does that mean? Certainly within the context of the malai that we've spoken to and the individuals that we've spoken to thus far, there is a platform that is already in place, which is the Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and the Crown has provided and developed principles over the decades. And the principles that are at play now are  partnership, protection, participation. And the fourth one, which is often left out, which is prosperity, which is a key factor in any relationship, in any partnership, in any engagement. And certainly when we're talking partnership, what is the mutual benefit? What are the mutual benefits of partnership? If there are no mutual benefits,  then it's not a great partnership. But first and foremost, the notion that the principles of the treaty would set the tone for engagement or set the tone for a relationship followed by engagement and partnership. As for a model per se, there are still those discussions ahead of us as to what that might look like.  and it may not look like anything that we've enjoyed thus far. It's a new world and other things are afoot. All of the pressures of the world are  being felt by marae as well, the rising cost of living, etc, etc. So all of these things will have an influence of what it is that we could possibly do going forward. The timeframes for this are certainly not the timeframes of Council, but  We have to give mana whenua their time to make their considerations and their thinking. They don't work to our timeframes. Yeah, that's about all I can report on at the moment. Bill. Kia ora koutou.",

    "text": " Tamako and the traveller from us, Hikoi, Gary. Welcome back to Aotearoa. So I'm pleased about that. Thanks, Shane and Gary, for bringing this report to Council. It was great reading it and you've already picked up on one of the questions I had, which was about prosperity.  and the mutual existence of that in terms of the Treaty principles. So thanks for picking that up. If I might just raise the question of Apakura, because when we get to marae-based protocols, of course, in our rohi, we don't have any marae.  We have marae that are in Waipa District, we've got Purikiriki, but it's not in our rohi, it's not in Apakura's rohi. So, you know, that is one of the drawbacks for us, a lot of them.  After Ranginolfia, a lot of our marae had roads and redoubts put all over what were our traditional significant sites. So I just, you know, just wanted to come back to that and acknowledge from the earlier discussion and Roger's point about the map at the back of us here, which lists a whole lot of marae that no longer exist.  as Apakura go forward with their strategic planning, we hope to bring back. So, you know, I just wanted to put that there. The next question that I had was, what is the present state of ICC of the Iwi Consultative Committee? Because I was a member of that, and I'm not sure, as a member of it, what its present status is.  And you talked about refreshing the models, but have we already chucked one thing out while we await another, is I guess the question I've got and would like to have answered. And whether the need for change was something that was driven by the partnership, which I think you have answered in part. So those are my questions so far. So kia ora.",

We have P\u016brekireki and notable also is the intent to speak with the Runanga and we had our first engagement yesterday.  and looking forward to that conversation. Apakura, of course, being spread far and wide across Tainui, beyond the boundaries of their normal and natural home here in Waipa. So that's the mitigation, or that's the way forward, is to have those continuing conversations with P\u016brekiriki and to have conversations through the runanga.  and then take our progress from there.",

Because I just want to make comment around, I've actually asked Gary D for a budget to look at compromising shame. My own desires when I got in here was look, and I've expressed it to Shane before around calling a full iwi  hui with our other iwi representative groups which would include Nga Iwi Topu, Maniapoto-Ki-Te-Raki and all those groups that council has engaged with over 30 years and bringing them to  my centre of the universe, Paraoira, to have that discussion and support Shane with how he started. Because for many of you, I'm not sure you realise the Crown actually clustered us into iwi. We actually don't like to be iwi. We like to be hapu and marae based. And that's where we do a lot of it. We focus our functions from. So I, you know, I know I've been to Gary to ask, to look at just even looking after me around feeding the people that will come because  the people that will come. I will not have the budget to do that when I'm seeking the outcomes for my hat here at Council. So yeah, just going back and just making sure that  These two guys have the right resourcing when they go out to engage with our wh\u0101nau, there's nothing worse than us going out as council, wanting things from iwi and we don't even take a packet of biscuits or anything, so that just sits in the back of my head, so t\u0113n\u0101 t\u0101tou.",

Tenehenehenui is the new body that drops out of the Ngati Maniapoto Trust Board that used to exist. Now that they have settled, they become Tenehenehenui.  the other board has gone. This board here now represents groups that are now in their clusters of whare. Those whare are made up of those hap\u016b and those marae that will talk and do the functions while this board here, and Shane will correct me if I'm wrong, deals with the crown functions. But individually in here are like the groups that we have closer in Waip\u0101 who deal with going out with the consents and all of that kind of stuff.  But what I'm saying to you is prior to the Crown doing settlements, and we've always enjoyed being at a hap\u016b marae level, but we know we still have to operate as iwi because that's how the government makes things for us and how we have to engage like that.

Two big questions. The first one was, I guess, around the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi, including prosperity. So I've been really familiar  with other four principles, protection, participation, partnership, and redress. It's the first time I've heard mention of prosperity. Yeah, so I'd appreciate a bit more, I suppose, k\u014drero around that. And the second thing I'd like to understand a bit deeper  is um which in the report says there's a an acknowledgement that it isn't really working that well and in fact not a great deal of knowledge what it actually does you know at a as a hapu and a marae level and yet that seemed to me to be the hapu and marae um body that that would be able to give input to council that seemed to be you know the the ideal um  I suppose, approach that recognises that's how M\u0101ori in this area like to work.

And I think if they hadn't been here in certain places to engage with, I think there could have been some stuff that would have happened for M\u0101ori without their consultation or their work. So I'd like to acknowledge Ng\u0101iwi T\u014dp\u016b for all of the work that they did prior to even being financially supported for all the efforts that they did contribute to.  one of the the shitty things is is that yes we have to we as M\u0101ori because we were made to do it this we're made to do it this way now settlements have what what's really good for Waip\u0101 is we're all settled all the iwi that sit in the Waip\u0101 boundaries have settled so every now and again well most of them have said sorry Bill  trying to just make an example here of how we get clustered into this process and while we're in the middle of the process we're having to still deal with all this other business with this entity while we're dealing with our own entity and then we have to dissolve that create the new identity while all of that's going on we're still doing the business with council and all the other entities so  I know it must be frustrating for the council side and entities when they want to engage with us, but I kind of look at my auntie Gaylene and people like Bill and them that have been engaged here for 30 years, never ever had any respect around decision-making, have been continuously asked to contribute and give and give. And yet there's been no patience for us around how we  have to then recalibrate ourselves within our own clusters that meet the regulations or the darn things that central and local government expect of us all the time. So I know it could be frustrating for you guys, but it's just as frustrating for us when we're responding as much as we can, a lot voluntary, because we're not on the clock,  But I think, too, I think some of these things, like I'm going to take it back to the water reforms. I think if we were involved over the last 100 years with how we looked after the water better, I don't think it would be the way that it is now. But we can go on forever about that. Kia ora tatou.",
