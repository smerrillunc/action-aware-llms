    "text": "OK. Thank you, Chair. Good morning, everybody. This is a workshop item going through what's been quite a complex  submission, draft submission on the Ministry for the Environment's discussion document on the emissions reduction plan that they are putting together. Now I was hoping I might be able to share a graphic, I'm not sure that I can just at the moment, but basically what the situation the government's in. The Climate Change Commission, you may recall earlier in the year, set a number of  carbon emissions budgets for 2025, period 2030 and the period of 2035. And currently on present policies that are proposed, we're not going to get our national emissions down that far.  So the ministry is looking for feedback on what they're proposing so far, plus any more ideas. So this isn't a submission on an emissions reduction plan. As such, they're just scouting for more ideas. So across council, we've put together this draft submission that needs to be with the ministry by the 24th. That's a week tomorrow.  The main points that we've put in so far are support for the general remarks by local government New Zealand and Taitoara, that local government needs to know what is expected from it. The document talks about the role that local government needs to have in helping move our communities into a low  emissions economy and lifestyle, but it doesn't actually tell us what they're expecting us to do or set any targets or anything like that. We're also making the point that this is going to cost a lot. And if we're going to rely just on rates funding, then  that's going to be difficult to achieve an equitable transition across all of our communities and also there needs to be some joined up thinking across government because we've got obviously some major reviews going on at the moment. This is yet another one so there needs to be joined up thinking and that joined up thinking needs to include local government  and the various other sectors where those are appropriate. The original discussion document posed 110 questions. We have not tried to answer 110 questions. Some of them don't really fall within the scope of council anyway. So we've got some responses that we think we can reasonably put forward to reflect council's perspective.  as well as supporting, as I say, LG and Z and Taituara. So I'm happy to go through this and gather your thoughts. Councillor St Pierre has emailed some comments through as well.",

The Climate Change Committee that reported back completely dismissed the carbon storage in pastures. And if you go on the ABC, I had a look at the rural website there in Australia, and they are very, very advanced in soil carbon.  I'm not too sure why it's discounted, but with all the pastoral area that we have, particularly in the Waikato and Waipaha, there's a whole lot of opportunities to offset that are not being realized. I just wonder if something needed to be added into there to the committee review that, or the Ministry for the Environment review that, even in America and Canada getting into that.",

The point that Claire's making is around making the case for regenerating and restoring native forests rather than, I think the term that she used is agricultural tree plantations. And the sequestration of carbon in soils is an example of that. But from what I can recall from the discussion document, they're talking around  native forests on the steeper slopes and the less agriculturally productive land. Yeah. So in that sense, that then becomes, I think, quite a reasonable argument for drawing attention to the sequestration, particularly in soil within our within our agricultural areas, particularly in this district.  So I think we can certainly add in something to that effect as well. Which of course ties into the highly productive land NPS as well, trying to protect those. That's why I say we need joined up thinking amongst all of these instruments.",

OK, certainly that that is a major source of of of wiper carbon emissions that we can do some something about. Potentially, and the other point that Claire was making on the planning  question. I think it's on page nine. Question 33 response there was seeing whether there's any tools we can use any evidence based tools to compare carbon emissions from various configurations of urban and commercial areas, different densities, so we can try to find some kind of optimal urban form for  for future planning decisions. So, those are basically her three points. Yeah, that's true. It's true. It'd be good to have how realistic they are at this stage. I'm not sure. And this is part of the problem that the ministry points out. They've got all these policy ideas, but there's still a lot of work being done to try to work out just what the emissions impacts of these policies would be. So,  the gap between where we want to be and where we are could be even bigger than we would currently expect.",

So it's so quiet in there. They've all got these electric lifts and hoisters. And they just dock in and get a brand new top up of a fully charged battery from their big solar panels on the roof.

Look, I was just looking at that transport section as well, and I mean, most of the comments and questions relate to light vehicles, and there is actually, there's no real, other than there is one, the freight transport question at 54. It doesn't really give any opportunity for there to be any input directly around those issues you just raised, Graham, in terms of the,  you know, the reality of electric solutions in heavy industries like, that are dominating our district, if you like. So I don't know if it quite fits there. I don't know if they're actually even asking about that, but for us, it's quite a topical thing for our district, but I'm not quite sure how that then relates in terms to council's work, but I suppose it's something that we need to be really mindful of, isn't it?  The questions seem to be mostly focused around light vehicles and freight transport and missing the whole point that there are swathes of industry around our country that will be looking at electric options going, really? I don't know that this is going to be effective. So I don't know if any of the questions, as I say, directly enable us to put that out. Maybe we could put something there in paragraph 57 in terms of other views.  But I mean, when I attended the last field days, people visited the site with great curiosity about an electric truck. And the electric truck's battery was about, took up a good one third of the tray of the actual truck itself. So the,  You're limiting your capacity, wouldn't you be? Yeah, yeah. Efficiencies would be pretty minimal, I think. But I mean, there are places that would work, but I guess knowing the ins and outs of dairy farming, as both do you, Graeme, and Bruce, I have significant question marks there. And I guess I'm hopeful that in the fullness of time, technology will provide us with the perfect answer.  and we'll all go on happily on our way, but I guess for now, those answers aren't particularly compelling, and Alwyn too, of course, you'll understand that. So yeah, just wanted to flag that, that it's a significant vacuum of technology and potentially a lack of understanding of the realities of farm life, which is pretty big in the lives of a lot of people in our district.",

But we can still put in comments around that and hoping that that technology research can be brought forward. I can certainly talk about the need for that supporting infrastructure.  And certainly council is already being approached by people wanting to put charge points in, either in towns or elsewhere in the district. So that is starting to happen. But you need to look, obviously, at, as you say, the long distance traveller as well. There's also some research that I've seen in North America that where you put a charge station,  can affect the local economy in that immediate area. That's presumably where you want to position your cafe, or you'd rather have a charge point right outside your cafe because people can then park up and where you're going to spend 20 minutes while it charges, you come into my cafe. So there are economic impacts as well as to where they're located.  So there's quite a bit of stuff I can put into question 57 that reflects the wiper perspective and the wiper way of life.",

    "text": " Thanks, Dawn. So, Susan, this is just in reference to what you're saying, that the Ministry for the Environment, as another one key part of their work, has chosen large batteries, so that is 5kgs and above, so that is cars and up, as part of one of their mandatory product stewardship schemes, and that is currently being designed and is out for consultation. And Dawn and I are hopefully going to share that with you guys in your Friday update.  and then we can bring forward your views to link up. But so maybe just even a caveat, kind of a general statement saying that you support a mandatory product stewardship for batteries. And yeah, so I've got some wording there that we can definitely work on. And so that is underway and happening, so that is positive.",

Can I just add on the back of the infrastructure charging stations discussion, in June, I attended an Infometrics webinar on the Climate Change Commission report, and they provided a bit of data there around sort of best practice and things. And I noted that there's an expectation that charging infrastructure will be made available every 75 kilometres on New Zealand roads.  So that's a lot of infrastructure when you think about the length of our roads. So who's going to question mark, who pays for that? Is that going to be a best practice? Yeah, lots of things fall out of the bottom of that, I guess. So I just wanted to add that. Thanks, Sally.",

So they're using and shredding tyres and actually using it as a component in our roading industry. And I was just wondering whether we had, I know we're a small country and we're, as we say, 5 million people, but whether that would be an option because we have a major infrastructure problem with our recycled tyres.  I've seen mounds of them everywhere and getting rid of them with investigating.",

So you guys will be able to read a little bit more information about that and share your views. So that is one of the options that they talk about because yeah, so it'll be where you buy a tire, you pay for the responsible end use at the outset. So, and then returning the tires is a hundred percent free. So yeah, that'll be within that same document that we can share  That's out for consultation on scheme design. Thank you very much.",
