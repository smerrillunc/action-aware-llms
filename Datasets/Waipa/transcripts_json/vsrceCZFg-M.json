And then I would obviously, if there are any questions from any of the other documents as well, please feel free to fire away afterwards. What I would like to do as well, I will invite, I will talk to most of the document, but I'll invite Dr Janelle Ward to take you through all of the species updates. This is Janelle's area of expertise.  But look, the team are here as well. So if there are any questions afterwards, obviously, fire away. So this is the July to October report. And typically, we would do July to September. But given just the way things have been sort of moved around a little bit, I thought possibly it might be prudent to include October just in case. So I'll just start from the beginning.  Part one of the report looks at incursions and breaches. So year to date, there have been eight incursions of pests at Mongatotre. We had ship rat tracking in July. We've had three incursions of possums in September. And the police report that all the possums were caught. And a subsequent detection, possum detection dog  and was brought to the Mongar week of the 20th of September with no further possums being detected. Also, shipwreck tracking was picked up in three locations in October and at the moment we have live incursion responses in place across all of these locations.  In terms of fence management, there have been eight fence breaches at Maungatautui in this financial year. And now I'd just like to hand over to Janelle, who will take you through 1.3, the species updates.",

    "text": "Kia ora tatou, I'm Janelle Ward, t\u014dku ingoa. For the month of October, there were 11 brown kiwi released this year, and that brings our total towards the end of October.  of 339 kiwi that we have introduced to the mountain. And it's looking really good for that. And we're doing some monitoring at the moment, including some fence line monitoring with up to 20 cameras. And this is part of the strategy with the Kiwis for Kiwi for starting to plan for translocations out from the mountain in the next couple of years.  We have both takah\u0113 pairs that we have at Maungatautari have attempted nesting so far this season. They started in September. Unfortunately, one of the pairs, by the end of October, was unsuccessful. The eggs were not viable, and unfortunately we had to destroy that nest, but we're hoping that she will nest again. But the very good news, which is technically November,  is that we do have a chick hatched with our second pair in the Cooper's enclosure. So we're just waiting for our first video footage of that chick. In other exciting news, we have had some progress with the K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d potential transportation in future, with some funding received from the Department of Conservation to initiate the prototype fence modifications to prevent K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d from climbing out of the sanctuary.  So by the end of November, we will have a prototype in place with the plan. In terms of surveys this year, unfortunately, we have had a number of holdups due to the COVID lockdowns. Luckily, none of us will have a long-term detrimental effect, but there has been some impact. So, for instance, with our HIHI annual survey, we did have to cut this short this year. Normally, we would have 40 days. It was much reduced.  but the good news is she still thinks she has enough data for us to get a reasonably good population estimate, and she didn't think that our population is stable. With titi pounamu that were introduced in May and June this year, we do have some obligations under our permit to provide surveys, and one of those was supposed to be completed in the spring pre-breeding, and unfortunately, as we were all in lockdown, we've been unable to complete that,  The good news is that we have had a summer intern from Otago University who will be coming to stay at the marunga once we can do, under COVID conditions. And he's going to be tracking and monitoring titi p\u016bn\u0101mu over the summer. Our hocksteaders frog survey has had to be postponed multiple times, but in speaking to EcoQuest, we will be able to achieve that next year.  We've also made some progress on starting some fish surveys again at Maungatautari, which there's been quite limited fish surveys happen since some species were released over 10 years ago. And it'll be great to make some progress on this and we've got some help through NIWA. And then lastly, we've got within our report, a couple of reports on deceased wildlife that were found at the sanctuary. One was a Kiwi who was found to have drowned.  and one was a teke who was actually found outside of the fence and was predated on. So just showing the importance of that fence and stopping, you know, the rats and stoats and stuff attacking our kaunga species. We've also got a number of research projects ongoing and they're listed in the report there, but most of those have actually been on hold with no visits to the maunga throughout the COVID lockdown. And we've just got one that's restarted recently.  And that's me, thank you.",

And I would also like to report, although it's not covered in this report, we did have a notifiable event at the beginning of November, which was reported to WorkSafe.  which has been cleared by WorkSafe now. And fortunately everybody who was involved in the event is safe and well and back at work. But it was during the windy day that we had on the 3rd of November. And we had a tree that actually fell across one of our tracks and landed on top of the ute. And so we're obviously very relieved that everybody's okay. And as I say, WorkSafe have signed off and yeah,  know, carry on. So we are doing and obviously, we will always review things like that. And just to see if there are any things that we can do better. And just to try and prevent those things happening. And then just moving through to section three on visitors, and we have had  An interesting first five months of operation, moving in and out of lockdown and obviously with border closures, which we all are obviously very familiar with now. That has obviously translated into a significant reduction in our visitors. So year to date, we are approximately 51% below pre-COVID visitor numbers. And then the  Again, compared to 2020, we are down as well, just the way the lockdowns have been falling. So we are projecting that we will have a reduction in visitor numbers this year. But from a financial perspective, we're still very robust and have done some good work around sponsorship, funding, and donations as well. And also, we've been recipients of the  wage subsidies as well. Then moving through to project section four, again relating to just the challenges that COVID is presenting, our education centre build has now been postponed until February 2022 and we have experienced some delays because of COVID and also there are some supply chain issues that are flowing through into the projects as well.  And, but we yeah but that's and. Now, hopefully, looking at February 2022 is locked in and then jobs for nature and over the last it's in October and November, we started off for new jobs for nature rangers and all started on the first it was, I think, from memory.  And then also, we have just started our new Sanctuary Manager, Bodhi Taylor. Bodhi joined the team on the 18th of October. And finally, our Toil Hall My Ranger Cadetship, that concluded on the 6th of September, and we're working to reintroduce that from March of 2022. Any questions?",

There are two schools of thought on this subject. There are some people who would argue that trapping outside the fence  potentially opens those areas up to be reinvaded by new incoming pests. And sometimes when you have a resident population alongside the fence line,  those resident animals set up a territory and realize they can't get through the fence and stop testing it. And so they deter other pests. So there is a bit of an argument that, you know, that's not necessarily the right way to go. But in my opinion, I absolutely agree. Preemptive control, you know, around the fence line is definitely an area we want to get into and do more of. And there's a few challenges there around, you know, access and where we can't.  where we can and cannot trap and things like that. But yeah, absolutely. I think that's a good piece of work to look into. It's probably more of a challenge around resources more than anything else. Yeah.",

I didn't expect to be picking up possums as fast as I did because we had had no sign  of anything within the fence.

This has translated into industry recognition, receiving Qualmark Gold Standard in December 2020, and being nominated as finalists in the New Zealand Tourism and the Waikato Business Awards. The long-term goals of our 10-year restoration plan are to increase the indigenous dominance and species occupancy on Maungatautri,  and to increase the number of people who treasure the Monga and are involved in its operation. Today we'd like to share some highlights from our last financial year and some of our new initiatives for the next 12 months and show how we are progressing towards these goals. Before I hand over to the team, I'd like to provide some context to our presentation.  In 2019, Sanctuary Mountain began aligning our reporting to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. In early 2020, we joined the Waikato Wellbeing Project and embedded the United Nations SDGs into our systems for collective impact. Simply put, we believe that by restoring the maunga with our partners,  We are positively impacting and contributing to the creation of strong, vibrant and resilient communities. This is our theory of change. So tonight, our team's presentation will be in three parts. Firstly, we'll share with you how our Restoration Mahi is having a positive impact and building an ecological foundation  Following this, part two of our presentation shows how our ecological foundation supports and builds social well-being. And finally, part three provides an overview of the importance of our partnerships and how they are intrinsically linked to our overall success. I'd now like to invite Janelle, Warwick, Dan and Craig to tell of this great Mahi  what they do daily to build a strong ecological foundation by sharing the mauri and mana of the monga. Team, over to you.",

On the top left here I'm sharing some species survey data with you and we have the hihi population estimates from surveys over the last few years since they were introduced and you can see that in the previous survey in 2019 we had our highest population recorded yet  And the survey at the end of 2020, it finished around October 2020, did show a slight decline in the population estimate from that time. But overall, we do have a stable population. And the current HIHI survey is going ahead in 2021. On the bottom left, I've got a graph here of the founding Kiwi population that have been released to Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautiri. And we now have,  over 300 founders that have been released to the main mountain and just over 100 of those released in the last year. On the bottom right we've got the k\u014dkako census. So we were this year successful in achieving some funding to go ahead with our large k\u014dkako census.  and we were able to employ Dave Bryden and co to do a fantastic census that showed us that we have just over 100 birds. So 101 territorial k\u014dkako were discovered at Maungat\u014dtiri. This is actually more than double the previous survey, which happened in 2018, where we had about 44 territorial birds. And with more than a doubling of the population in two years,  This is actually the fastest known growth rate of k\u014dkako on the mainland. In other species monitoring, we have, of course, we take close charge of our takah\u0113 pairings and their offspring. We have two pair of takah\u0113 at the mountain. And overall, we've had 21 juveniles produced from these two pair.  and we have two juveniles that were produced in the last financial year. These two were named Waiti and Waita, and because we introduced new males last year, they actually have some superior genetics and are up in the top genetically for the country. We also this year set up a permanent lizard survey plot in the southern enclosure.  and this consists of 80 different stations over eight transects and includes ground covers, tree covers  and monitoring tunnels. And we had our first survey at February 2021, and we only discovered two forest geckos at this time, but it was a really good start as we hadn't had it up in place for long. We're going to be making some mild changes to the tree covers over the next couple of months, and hoping to do the next lizard survey later this year.  Also in 2020 and 2021, in the last financial year, we managed to complete the Tuatara survey, which was right on due at the five year mark. And we were able to find 27 plus Tuatara in the Tuatara, in the wetland, and 24 plus Tuatara  at the other site where we have Tuatara that we do not disclose. This included quite a number of juveniles and showed that they are breeding successfully and that some of those juveniles are being recruited into the population. And all of the adults that we caught were in really good body condition and looked great. And we found up to 75% of the initial founding Tuatara, which was a really good result.  We also had a frog survey this year. The EcoQuest does the frog surveys every three years, and it was due in 2021. So in April of 2021, we did the first part of the survey, with the second part due to occur in November 2021, of course, pending COVID restrictions. So this was immensely successful. It was the first time we'd used  Sanctuary Mountain volunteers in quite a long time and that's because EcoQuest of course can't bring in their American students to the country so we were able to sort of take the place and it was a great learning experience for many of our volunteers and staff and with lots of people getting to see Hocksteaders frogs for the first time.  We've also initiated a couple of fungal survey projects in the past financial year, including an iNaturalist project at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautiri. And with that iNaturalist site, we've so far identified over 64 different fungal species. And we also have a new researcher from Scion called Ian Hood, who's starting some wood fungi long-term research.  Of course, one of the biggest events of the year was the Rifleman or Titipunamu Translocation, where we picked up 40 birds from Puriora Forest and 40 birds from Pirongia Mountain. And these were released in late May and early June.  and it was an amazing experience. Everything went super well and 100% of the birds released did fly off successfully. The plans are to, of course, survey these guys in the next couple of years to make sure that they're thriving and that they're breeding.  K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, they are due to be released at the end of 2022. And this financial year, I was actually really lucky to be able to go down to Whenua Hou and participate in some of the fence trials to see how k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d would interact with the fence that we have here at Maungatautari.  And that went really well. We do have now a modification in our design that we are currently testing and going to put to the next level. And if this is successful, which I think it will be, we hopefully will be well on track to receiving k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d as planned in late 2022.  We've also had some M\u0101ori North Island k\u0101k\u0101 monitoring and a little bit of wild bird rehabilitation as we had some injured birds this year that we took to Hamilton Zoo. And we are looking at a permit to extend our ability to be able to release captive bred k\u0101k\u0101 in the next following year. In other species management activities, obviously we continue our feeding for takah\u0113, h\u012bh\u012b and k\u0101k\u0101.  and we have a lot of research happening on the mountain over the past year and continuing. We have a number of universities that have got some ongoing projects that are happening around the mountain and these include invertebrate genetics and abundance, tree phenology and water quality.  We've also got some significant restoration work happening in the Tautari wetland and we're also starting in 2021 some plans for some new restoration work in the southwest of the mountain.  So species monitoring to happen over the next financial year. We do have the second part of the frog survey to hopefully complete in November. And we're just starting a new process for fish survey. So we're going to be working with some colleagues at  Niwa and designing a new fish survey so that we can see what's happened with those guys that were released some time ago now in both the southern enclosure and the wetland.  Although we have a booming population of k\u014dkako, we have determined that they're not quite enough founders for really good genetic health of that population. So we are planning to translocate up to another 20 birds over the next couple of years. And that hopefully will first start happening in 2022 with birds potentially coming from Territory M\u0101tangi.  We are seeking funding for that and it will be determined on securing that funding in time to be able to plan this successfully. And last but not least, we will continue with upgrading our lizard surveys plots in the southern enclosure and we hope to carry out another survey in summer of 2022. Thank you.",

    "text": " I was born on the side of the River Kirikiriroa, under the mountain of Pirongia. I am a Westerner from Scotland, from Denmark, from England. Where is the north of Haupo? My name is Dan Howie. T\u0113n\u0101 koutou katoa.  Greetings everyone, my name is Dan Howey and I'm the biosecurity team leader here at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautari. The biosecurity and operations team are mainly concerned with detecting and eradicating pests on the maunga and maintaining the predator-proof fence. This work is essential for Sanctuary Mountain to achieve its sustainable development goals of protecting native flora and fauna on the maunga and allowing the ecosystem there to thrive.  The last year saw a total of 13 pest incursions to enclosures at Maungatautari. Two of these incursions were from mice, eight from ship rats, and three from weasels. The map on the screen indicates where these incursions happened. Blue squares show where weasels have been trapped, red dots where ship rats have been detected or trapped, and yellow triangles where mice have been detected.  For all of these incursions, pest responses were put in place and all enclosures are once again pest free, with the exception of the northern enclosure where an ongoing pest response has been conducted. Some of the highlights for our team over this past year. We had a visit from the DOC Conservation Dogs Program where around 20 handlers came to the maunga  and swept the mountains searching for a variety of pest species including rodents, mustelids, Argentine ants, plague skinks and the like. It was a great opportunity to test the pest free status of the maunga and for our team to collaborate and share knowledge with peers in the industry.  James and his rodent detection dog Rua achieved interim certification in this year and we're also privileged to have cadets join our team from both the Te Puni K\u014dkiri cadetship program and through a relationship with Toi Ohomai. Some of the important work coming up in the biosecurity space over the next year  We had a review conducted on Sanctuary Mountains Biosecurity Plan last year and our team are currently working through the recommendations from that review. Probably the most visible one will be the installation of biosecurity stations at entrances to all enclosures on the Mauna. This is boot brush and bag check stations effectively.  Another interesting development in the next year to come is the recruitment of four new team members via Jobs for Nature funding. These recruits will help our team considerably and will be concerned mainly with fence replacement and track maintenance on the maunga. Over the past financial year, our team responded to 86 after-hours fence call-outs and several more through the day.  Seven of these call-outs were for significant events causing a total of nine sections of fence to be destroyed. The map on the top of the screen shows where these fence replace or fence breaches rather happened. Red dots are where vegetation has struck and damaged the fence or formed a bridge across the fence and the blue square is where a culvert was found jammed open as a result of a storm event.  Also, the operations team has been conducting a variety of maintenance work. The map in the bottom right of the screen indicates where this work has happened. The blue line indicates where track maintenance was conducted on the Wairereverse and on the northern perimeter road. The green line indicates where weed spraying has been conducted right the way around the maunga on many of the access tracks. The pink line indicates where tree felling was conducted by arborists where dead and dying trees were threatened with offence.  And the orange line indicates where hedge trimming was conducted on the forest margin for the majority of the way around the maunga. Also, our team has been conducting an upgrade of our EDAC dialers, which is the system that alerts us when there's a fence breach. This upgrade will allow the system to remain compatible with upgrades to the cellular network in the region. And the team continues to working on replacing slumping culverts right the way around the maunga.  important pieces or some exciting developments for the operations team in the year to come is the replacement of the aging components of the fence right the way around the maunga and once again this will be assisted by Jobs for Nature recruits. This will ensure that the fence continues to protect the precious ecosystem of our maunga for a long time into the future. Kia ora.",

    "text": " Kia ora tatou. Ko Craig Montgomery ahau. I am the Kiwi Ranger here at Sanctuary Mountain Maungatautere and I conduct most of the, if not all of the Kiwi work here at the sanctuary. So in total the sanctuary has now received 311 founding Western North Island Brown Kiwi. 72 of those from the original releases that happened here from 2005 to 2015  But since 2018 I've been a part of releasing 239 of the new kiwi k\u014dhanga founders. So in the last year it's been quite transformational as far as the surveys that we are starting to roll out on the mountain.  The biggest piece of work this year has been the Kiwi Conservation Dog Survey. We had Tom Donovan and James McLaughlin from up north come down and conduct a 60-day survey of the mountain with the goal of finding as many Kiwis as we possibly could. The goal behind that was to detect all those Kiwis and scan them with a microchip reader. Microchips are obviously what the founding Kiwis have implanted under their wing.  And so based on market chip versus non-market chip, we can find out a ratio of what the kiwi are doing on the mountain. So after those 60 days, we found 47 kiwis. 11 of those were founders, which could indicate that we have a very, very successful breeding population on the mountain because 36 of those were wild bred mongototiri birds.  which is really exciting. We always suspected they were doing really well, but it's really good to have some really concrete evidence that this is actually happening. And then we had our first official Kiwi call count survey. We had five sites all over the mountain, which we monitored for four consecutive days.  Now to do that I had to recruit a lovely bunch of volunteers and we had a training day which I think we had about 60 people turn up to that particular day and it was hugely successful and I think about 95% of those people actually came and participated in that survey. Amazing results, 16.8 calls per hour.  Nothing too alarming, but very exciting results in that. But the highest result at one site was 75 calls in one hour. So yeah, exciting. Watch this space. And this year I have also deployed trail cameras around the fence line. And this is a new monitoring technique that we're going to trial and refine as we go, which I'll go into in the next slide a bit deeper.  Yeah, so this year coming up, really exciting. It's our fourth season of releases. Probably going to be our last season, based on our surveys that we conducted in the last financial year, indicating that the mountain is really, really breeding really well. Okay, so the original goal was to release 500 kiwi onto the maunga as part of the k\u014dhanga strategy with Save the Kiwi.  But because the population is doing so well, we're going to probably tie over this year, and we're probably going to get close to 380 to 400 releases in total since 2018. So monitoring at all Kiwi maunga.  So during the KiwiDog survey we put transmitters on nine birds on the mountain and this is so we can start territory mapping. So territory mapping can indicate how big, well it'll tell us how big territories are, but if it's a large territory we can see that there's lots of space for the Kiwi. If it's a small territory we can see that there's a little bit of overcrowding, but at the moment  It's already looking like they're not overcrowded and they're very, very happy kiwi. And what else we got? So I'm also going to continue observing the movement on kiwi on the fence. So not just with the cameras, we're just taking pictures of kiwis and sort of calculating indexes or densities on the fence line. But we're also going to deploy transponder loops. So these remote microchip readers that will sit on the fence line.  and they will be able to tell us how many kiwi are running the fence line that are founding birds. So if we get a bit like the dog survey, out of four kiwi, one of those kiwis is a transponded third, that will give us a one in four ratio. This will also help us when we come to our capturing of the kiwi, because we don't want to be spending lots of dog hours in an area where there's lots of  transplanted birds because they're obviously the founders are supposed to stay on the mountain. With the camera work also, we're using it as a pest detection tool as well. So we are deploying zip motor lures, which is a device that fixes to the fence or a tree and pushes out a wee bit of mayonnaise every 24 hours. And this will help passively encourage pests to come and interact with this device and then I can capture pictures  alongside my kiwi work and tell us if there's pests or not. So yeah, something we've never done before but they're all very exciting all the same. We're going to repeat the marten recapture survey, which is a 30-day survey, and will give us an indication on how much the breeding has changed in the last 12 months. Because of course this year, the first year of k\u014dhanga birds will start breeding, so we can expect the  breeding and pool of juveniles to rapidly increase in the next one to two years. And we'll also repeat the Keep Your Call survey because it's a nice universal piece of survey technique that is used all through New Zealand and even though we've only just started using it, it's a good place to start and it's a good way to substantially capture the densities or just calling birds within a sanctuary, just an index of  Cool. All right. Well, thank you very much. And that's mine.",

We've been really fortunate this year to be able to provide learning experiences for 2,790 students and 662 adults, a total of 3,452 education visitors on site at Maungatautari.  Most of these education visitors have come from within the Waikato and Bay of Plenty regions. These numbers reflect a 16% increase compared to the previous year that was, of course, impacted by a full school term and lockdown. This year, we've also been impacted by the stop-start nature of changing alert levels. However, we have been able to deliver to a wide range of groups, and I'll share some of those through photographs on the next couple of slides as well.  To the highlights. So teachers have indicated to us a 97% satisfaction with the programs that we deliver and also a 97% satisfaction with the student engagement in these programs. So this is a fantastic result to see. I'd like to thank and acknowledge all of our educators for their hard work in facilitating these experiences. We've also had three new education contractors join our team this year.  and they have dived straight on in and done a great job with our school groups. So thank you to all of you for your support and your contributions. I'd also just like to take the opportunity to thank the wider Sanctuary Mountain team as well, as they support our education programme in a variety of ways, some of which you'll see shortly in photographs too. We've also been working hard on our pre-visit and post-visit resource materials for teachers.  can support them in a visit to Maungatautari and these resources are available on our website. Post-visit resources in particular focus on the actions that students can take either at home or back at school for conservation outcomes once they've had their visit. We've also initiated an e-newsletter that gets sent out to schools once per school term  This enables us to share stories of what's happening on the Maunga, but also opportunities and resources that are available for teachers within our education programme. We have close to 300 subscribers for that newsletter, and if you are a teacher involved with a school, or you know some teachers that might like to sign up to this e-newsletter, you can do so by going to the education section on our website. I'd also just like to thank a couple of people here  So in the photograph down below, the four students shown there are Year 2-3 students from Selwyn Ridge Primary School in Tauranga. And at the end of the year last year, they visited us having raised $400 at school that they donated during their visit. So thank you to them for that. And also thank you to Mother Earth for their ongoing support of our education programme. At the moment in the education space in New Zealand,  The New Zealand curriculum is undergoing a refresh that includes a bicultural framework. NCEA in our high schools is also undergoing a change programme. The environment that we are all working in at the moment as well means that it's important to look to alternative ways for us to provide opportunities, provide learning experiences for schools in the digital space or virtual space.  So this year we will continue to build our relationship with schools and continue to develop our education programme experiences in the light of these changes. We are also looking forward to the building of our education centre and the opportunities that will afford our programme as well. So I hope that these few photographs have shown you that schools really value a visit to Maungatautari to provide a real life experience  to make connections, and to extend their knowledge, and to bring to life their classroom learning.",

So, over the 2021 period,  did 430 tours to 1,463 visitors. That did see an increase, which is quite remarkable given the current situation of 7.4%. 18% of our visitors to Molotov 3 do a guided tour, so that's 82% that don't. So there is a real opportunity there to move these to guided tours.  Popular tours are our seasonal forest tour and our wetlands tour. You can only do the wetlands tours with a guide. So that's where we've got our two tourists we see, Tour Tala and Takahe. We did 35 night tours over that period and that accounted for 18% of our revenue. What we are missing here is inbound tour operators.  So our overseas visitors, we've had no inbound tours for 18 months. And in previous years, this has accounted for about 36% of our guided tours. So that increase is actually our regional visitors. We've had lots of Aucklanders and  Waikato and Bay of Plenty visitors, so that's great. So the focus for the coming year is to focus on our local tour operators. This can be really beneficial in that groups coming in come back as individuals, so they come back and bring their wh\u0101nau to visit.  We want to have a monthly calendar of themed and specialty tours, so there's something on offer each month. It's a bit different. We're also introducing longer tours with our local practitioners.",

So we should have that back today or tomorrow. So all the agreements are in place. Massive blow fly. So what we need to do now is to go through the Maryland court process. So Phil Lang is drafting all the required documents. We need to do that. The landowners are comfortable with us drafting them.  We need a couple of affidavits and there was an injunction that needs to be withdrawn. And there was a two road orders that are being surrendered. So we've got sign off from the adjoining landowner in relation to that. So it's all ready to go. It's just a matter of pulling the paperwork together and getting a court date to see that in place.  Gary Knighton spoke to one of the landowners this morning. The agreement was always to try and open the gate, even though the documentation hadn't been lodged or finalized. So we're working with those landowners on doing that. There's a couple of issues we just need to address, which are relatively minor that we can sort out in the next day or so. And then it's pretty much hopefully,  Prior to Christmas, we'll have the gate and the walkway open.",

The main achievement in recent months has been Pukeahu Farms Limited, so Quinn Dellinger's property. And, you know, over two and a half kilometres of fence and 2.53 hectares of land behind the fence. So I managed to get his agreement signed up late in August on the mudguard of his trailer up by his wall shed in the back of the property.  And since then, of course, we've had all the lockdowns and so on. And so getting the documents signed and through the system has been somewhat challenging. So they were signed, I think, by the Maungat\u0101tere Trust before we were due to have our last reserve committee meeting. And then that, of course, got cancelled at the last minute. So those documents were passed to the council and I'll need to check with  Sally, whether they have been signed. I know they had two signatures, but I think we were still waiting for one.",

    "text": " Yeah, so it's great to hear that. I must admit that COVID puts another level of challenges into this with documents in the system and also, you know, the extreme patience that landowners have to show while these things work their way through the system. It's difficult enough in ordinary times without the challenges of COVID.  So, ahead of us, we've got Richard and Gay Hicks' property, so 1.4 kilometres of fence on there and 0.33 hectares of land, or 33 hectares of land behind the fence, so it can't be that much.  But, so I still have to approach the Hicks' on Luckett Last Road. And then once that is negotiated, there just remain two properties to revisit. So it's Peter and Sandra Holmes. And you may well recall that Peter,  had some issues about not wanting to sign any documents, so that's just something to be revisited and see if we can get that over the line. And similarly, Peter and Kerry Watson, so those two properties adjoin one another. And I think, you know, certainly haven't ruled out achieving those, but that probably won't be before Christmas.  So that's where we're at. And that actually completes the full, I think, 24 landowners around the maunga. And then, of course, leaves the challenge of managing to get similar things completed for the M\u0101ori land, of which, of course, there's several blocks and quite a process to deal with that.",
