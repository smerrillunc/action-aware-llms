But we've certainly been keeping in touch with them. We had hoped that their efforts to contact all of the big trucking firms that use that route and encourage them to use State Highway 3 would have seen more of the trucks detour off 39 onto State Highway 3. But I don't think that has happened. And actually an email I got from them just today when I queried  how things were going, they responded, well, they haven't actually got, or they said they didn't have one of the signs up for the northbound traffic, meaning that they couldn't enforce the restrictions. And so some heavy traffic was still running over the old bridge there.  So I hope they do get all of the things in place that they promised that they would do. So our expectation is that they are regularly monitoring the detour route. So their contractor would do that, the signage and the road condition and the like. And they are responsible to repair any damage to the road or the single lane bridges  as a result of the detour. I mean, that's cold comfort for the residents along the route who are putting up with more heavy traffic and noise and, you know, trucks on roads, you know, much bigger trucks than those roads were designed to deal with. So I've certainly prodding Waik\u014dtahi to be monitoring and reporting and addressing any  negative issues that arise on that detour route as a result. But it is a little bit of a wait and see what happens, how well it works, and whether we need to take more steps or we require Waki Kotahi to take more steps to protect or, you know, change the way the detour route is operating.",

And so that was really good and quite an exciting development and long overdue. So, there was an online public consultation meeting about a month ago,  and that was really well done and well attended to. Quite a few community people there and some real good back and forth. So, I just commend staff there for facilitating that. That was really good. Lots of points come out of it and things to consider. So, no, the health guys are really looking forward to something progressing there, so it's cool. There was a letter from John Turner yesterday, I believe, went to Council, came back to me, I've seen. So,  and said much the same thing as everything else you know just we need a pedestrian crossing good to have it go forward just a few little tweaks here and there but hopefully we'll get it to work so that was good he also made mention and as did other people  So, if that could have some attention, I don't know if it would be at the same time or the same project.

So the guys have taken away that and they're working through it with the designers to see how many of those things can we accommodate, changes can we accommodate. So what things we can easily make changes and what things could be pretty difficult to change.  we're always in that position where we're dealing with Waka Kotahi as the road owner and we're kind of just sidling up to them and nudging them to get as much of what we need and want without annoying them too much because we need their cooperation to get a final sign off so we can build something. So  We want the, you know, the absolute best outcome for the village, for pedestrian safety, for parking, for the commercial area, for walking and cycling. And we've got to, you know, there are some, definitely some trade-offs across all of those things, and we've just got to try and get the best result. And, you know, not forgetting that other one where they mentioned that actually we get some pretty big vehicles  travel through our helper on the highway.

We'll take all of that feedback and put it into a revised plan because, you know, we want to make sure the community, you know, best informed that we can going forward. But obviously, we've got to show that revised plan to Waka Kotahi, who have to give it a final  sign off before anything can be built. So yeah, there's a few hurdles to jump through. And we also have to have a, what's called a safety audit of the design where independent designers take the plan, they visit the site and they look at all the possible pitfalls of the design and make sure it's safe from every aspect.  and they feed that information back to us. And then we obviously have to make any amendments and we've got to get Waikato to also accept any changes. So yeah, a number of steps to go through before we get to a final agreed plan that we can put into a contract document and get a contract on to building it.",

So, it was commented how much the esplanade was used during the lockdown period between dog walkers and just generally people trying to get out and about. So, we definitely appreciate that and we appreciate council's maintenance of that area.  We did experience some antisocial behaviour with, for example, signs being removed and damage done to properties over the lockdown. We feel it was family members who came back to stay with locals and were a bit bored and decided that they would take their boredom out on the signs and graffiti, which happens when we do have holiday periods.  The association itself is, sort of, going through a restructuring process and looking at more becoming a community connector rather than, sort of, having meetings, because we're finding the meetings are not being attended. And also, I'm not too sure at this stage what the changes with the one less representative at council, so we're just looking at how we can-, so they said in the light of the council changes,  We recognize the gravity of the changes and the importance of having a very visual representation to counsel from us and adapting ourselves to do that.

And, yeah, disappointing that the focus was on that and not on the councillors. But anyway, Koramatua. A bit like Pirongia, quiet because we've had this lockdown and  and we're opening up, but undecided how we're opening up, obviously to one or two people for dancing, et cetera. It's a piece of cake, they're vaccinated. But I have been talking to Bruce Nunns, and I think, yes, he's on here at the moment. He's been doing a bit of work with his team regarding what the council buildings are actually, the buildings that the council manage.  and what they're doing, and guidelines for that. And that's just come through this afternoon. So, nice and clear. We do not have to run with it, like Porongia's not running with theirs. They're doing their own thing. But I think that's something that I need to talk to the committee about, as to how comfortable they are. The last thing I want  is there to be an issue with being a COVID centre or place of interest and who's going to pay for the deep clean and other issues and also should there be a major incident where it required an insurance claim and guidelines from the council were that  you didn't have it open to anybody and everybody, insurance companies are looking for the first way out that they can. And if guidelines have been, and you haven't followed those guidelines, I think it could create an issue after the initial $10,000, of course.  But that's okay. And we're also, Bruce is also looking into the numbers of people that can be in the hall through firing things. So things that are being updated. And I think also maybe the leases need to be looked at as well. I mean, the people that signed our hall lease have all been dead and gone for a number of years.

    "text": "Yes, certainly. Good afternoon, Chair and committee members. Yep, so I won't  go through the whole report, take it as read, and just highlight a few key points of interest for you, which Claire has alluded me to previously. So the first one is water restrictions this year. So, you know, hopefully you're aware of previously for the last 10 years, we've had alert levels one, two, three, and four across the district, which we bring into, usually the 1st of December, we bring in alert level one.  And then we move through the alert levels depending on demand and supply issues. But we've changed due to a significant level of investment by the council over the last five years in water treatment capacity and water supply capacity that we're moving away from those determined alert levels and going with an educational campaign.  So the first part of that is hopefully you've seen the signs that now say save water or save why. Put a nice purple sign on the lamppost with a teardrop on it, a water drop. So that's the start of the campaign is to more educationalised rather than we're at level one, no sprinklers or whatever the outcome was. We won't be saying any of that. We're saying it's about conserving water. And so unless it gets serious and we get a severe drought that causes us to change  and bring in alert level threes and four, we won't be moving to having alert level one and two. It will be an educational campaign. We've got a social media campaign starting and a print media campaign starting all about education, how you could save water, all the normal things. So that's a change in tact for us.  And we're currently just compiling some documents that go with that. And one of them is our water story, which takes us through the last probably five or six years of where we've come from over those five or six years with investment, what we've done both in water and wastewater to show where we are today.  And why we've made these changes this they've enabled the change so that's that's the plan for the summer, hopefully we don't need to to go any more. into the older level threes or four that's largely dependent on say on the weather and on the supply to tahi.  Although we've now got water coming from the new Planet Parallel Road, which pumps water over to Te Amutu, we're still also reliant on Te Tahi as well. But not as reliant as we were, but we've still got some reliance on it. And it is all about that story of saving water. If demand goes crazy, we'll ramp up the message so people do the right thing.  Any questions on that?",

    "text": "Yeah. And if it got that way, we've turned off the old parallel road plan. We could turn that back on to supply Pukerimu  and send all the water over to Timutu. So we've got some plans if it does get very dry. And the next one was the flood hazard mapping. So if you're aware, over the last wee while, we've been doing a flood hazard mapping process. So we've done a model that predicted where properties would flood across the district, only in urban areas.  We haven't done rural, that's the next stage. And as an account of that modeling, we determined there was a thousand houses that could be a risk of being flooded. And that's not the garden being flooded, that is the house being flooded. So there was approximately a thousand houses. So we sent letters to all those properties to address that issue, telling them we'd identify them as possible.  But we had some more work to do to confirm that number. And the confirmation we needed was more detailed modeling and going out to site and actually surveying the levels to determine that. And we've reduced the number from that 1,000, we're down to now less than 100 of houses that we predict in a one in 100 year rain event that their house would flood. So we're close, we've still got a couple to survey before we completely finished.  but we'll be planning, we'll be sending those letters out in the new year to those houses that we believe could be at risk of flood. And those letters will be on their limbs for them and for any future purchases to see. So there is an impact of that work. And we've, most of the thousand people we have alerted apart from those hundred, most of them have had a letter  that says we've done further work and they're no longer, we deem them no longer at risk of flooding their house in that one in 100 year event. But say we still got a few stragglers that we need to survey where no one's been at home or we haven't had permission to go on the property. So we're still working through those issues. But it's been a long, a very long project. And on January 17th, when we send those letters out, we'll also have a map  On our GIS system, like our intermaps, where you can go on and look at where all the pipes and stuff are. You can go on and look at a flood hazard map and you can be able to see for yourself where those flood hazard areas are. It will be quite coarse for the public viewing. The staff view will be much more detailed. This will be quite coarse, but it will prompt questions if someone looks at their house, it looks like it's flooded.  to be flooded they can give us a call and we can go into more detail and tell them yep from our model it looks like your garden would flood and pond in the left-hand corner but your house shouldn't flood. So we'll be able to go to that level of detail. So that's been a long journey and the last one was stormwater. I don't really know anything in particular in stormwater Clare but one of the things we're doing  um in in Cambridge around where the white church is we're just putting in some rain gardens so rain gardens take the runoff from the road and it goes through a little garden just looks like a roadside garden and it cleans the first the first flush off the road is is held in in the rain garden and prevents it um getting into the system and so that will protect um more future contaminants going into the lake so all there's a there's about  12 rain gardens were put in all that protect Lake Tukahutu from that first flush of contaminants off the road. So that's a project we started a while back and we've got a ready to lead a contract for that and now started February for that. And that's the first trial area. If you'd like to see how successful that is and then there'll be plans in the future to roll out more rain gardens as part of our, we were just in the process of  renewing our stormwater consent, which will be for the whole district. And the last one we got 10 years or 15 years ago didn't have much in it around quality of discharge. The new consent we're about to get will be very much a quality based outcome requiring us to have treatment on an awful lot of stormwater discharges. So it'll be an expensive  deliverable at the end, once we've got the consent to meet the requirements of that consent. But it will improve the environment substantially. So that's a good thing. Yeah. OK, I'm happy to answer any questions. I just think you've done brilliantly, Martin.",

So I'll just skim over a couple of items and then just a chance to ask questions. So typically the quarterly report is just often an information report giving an update on where things are at.  This one did have one recommendation that council support the submission to Waikato Tahi to raise the speed limit on the Waikato Expressway to 110 when the last remaining parts of it are complete and have had the safety upgrades done on it. So,  We look forward to the day that that's all finished because it's a pretty marvellous asset for Waikato, just a Waikato region, which has been many years in the making and billions of dollars. So it's pretty cool. In the programme there we list some of the transport programme for the year. We've got some  roads at the top there we were doing design work to do reconstruction type work so the first contracts out to tender at the moment for Panui Road, Whitmore Street and also a seal extension on Low Road near Rukahia. Tipahu Road is one area where we've got a design underway and so that's from just  or around the Clothier Road intersection going north for just over a kilometre. And it treats that quite narrow section of road, which is also, I guess, the seal is quite worn. We've had a few crashes there in the wet and there's some signs up in locations there warning of a slippery road surface. So that's a piece where there'd be a bit of widening and strengthening of that piece of road.  So we're doing the design now and depending on how our budget holds up, because certainly construction costs for all road construction work have really gone up. We talk about inflation and where it's running, but often in the roading scene, the costs have increased 10, 15, 20 percent for some types of work.  in the last 18 months. And that just reflects the growth going on in the region where so many of the contractors have got full workbooks, you know, building subdivisions and, you know, housing developments and things like that, which are really going on.  As far as resealing, so back in October, we started the chip sealing work around the district, and we've done quite a lot of that in urban areas and a little bit in the rural. So you will see more of that, you know, in the next two months around the district. Can we ask questions now, just while you're on it? Yes, yeah, sure. I just, Mystery Creek, and I've been on to you about it, it's been extensively patched.",

    "text": " Yeah, no, good point. We certainly know that parts of Mystery Creek Road are showing their age and there's quite a bit of wear and tear and even before the Kaipake Road sand quarry  you know, gets fully operational, there's already been quite a bit of heavy traffic through that route from, you know, the Cambridge sand quarry, all heading towards the south side of Hamilton. You know, we've got a number of sand quarries operating in our district that really serve  both the housing market in Waipa but significantly the housing market in Hamilton. So often these roads like Mystery Creek Road, Kaipake Road have a lot of heavy traffic on them and historically they were quite lightly built roads. You know we dig a hole in them there might only be  100 millimetres or 150 millimetres of gravel underneath the seal. And for these country roads, which now have a lot more heavy traffic, normally they would have sort of like 300 millimetres, so double the depth of pavement underneath them. So we've got to prioritise roads in terms of maintenance cost and safety. And so sometimes it is most economical to make some repairs and reseal them and get another five years life out of them.  before we can afford to reconstruct them. It costs around $4 or $5 a square metre to reseal a road, even if we spend $10,000 or $20,000 doing repairs. And that's a big difference to the cost of about $50, $60 or $70 a square metre for reconstruction of the road. So it is really a numbers and economics sort of game in terms of  If we can get more life out of that pavement, we're obligated to do that to balance the budget. And sometimes, yeah, as you say, ideally we want the pavement as smooth as possible before reseal goes on, but all sorts of vagaries, traffic and weather and things can impact on that. But if it is bumpy afterwards and causing issues with noise, then yes, our contractor would have to fix it at their cost.",

    "text": " Sure, sure. Yep. So peat roads, yep, they operate on a fine sort of moisture balance. And when we get a really dry summer, then the land beside the road dries out and that sucks moisture out from under the road and the peat shrinks. So the road on top of the peat is almost like a water, you know, a raincoat.  And it means that for most of the time, the moisture content in that peat is reasonably stable until we get a drought type situation. And then the surrounding land dries out, the peat under the road dries out and shrinks. And if the peat is anything from sort of  you know, three to five to 10 metres deep, then, you know, there's nothing we can do to stop that shrinkage. I know that if farm drains are not close to the road or farm drains, if they're not cleaned out, so they're left where they are so that water levels remain high, then that can partly protect the road and reduce that peat shrinkage. But we, you know, last summer we had a lot of  shrinkage and we've we repaired the worst pieces in some places we had to put up signs and temporary speed limits like Collins Road is one of those and say hey you need to slow down because we cannot we simply cannot afford to fix all of these roads. I think this year we've probably allocated three to four hundred thousand dollars to go in and smooth  some of those roads which are out of shape. But if we do end up with another dry summer, we'll get another $300,000 or $400,000 worth of damage from that drying that we'll have to repair as well. So it is a risky business, but sometimes the only option we've got is to do some light smoothing and put up those signs and warn people to slow down.",

    "text": "Hi, everyone. So I'm the manager of district plan and growth and there's  Quite a lot to cover in this report, it's quite comprehensive, so I'll just skim through like the other managers here, just cover the high bits really. So probably the first one to cover is under item four, so Future Proof, just an update. So Future Proof is going through an update of the growth strategy, the sub-regional growth strategy. They've got their hearings this week. The second day of hearings was today on submissions to change the strategy.  There are a number of submissions from developers, I guess, looking to the next 20, 30, even 50 years out and taking an opportunity, I was supposed to say, where could the future of the sub-regional go to? In the area of your interest, I suppose, Ahaup\u014d was a submission that came up today. And there are three landowners who were representing the 02, 03 and 04 growth cells in Ahaup\u014d.  and their submission was seeking to bring that forward. At the moment, it's marked for post-2035 in the district plan, and they were looking to bring that forward so that development could start, and there were large lot residential zones. So the future brief will go through. There's a panel. It's almost like a pseudo-resource management panel. Mia Jim is Waip\u0101 Council representative on there.  and they'll go through and make their decisions on whether there's any merit in any of these. It was hard to pick from the questions on whether there was any support for that particular proposal, so I guess we'll wait and see. The Three Waters, I think you're fairly familiar with that and probably Martin is better. Not sure if he's still there, but he's probably better qualified to cover that off. There is a study to investigate a rapid transit network  the future proof in the Hamilton metropolitan area, that generated a bit of interest in the future proof hearings. It was a bit unclear what rapid transit means, and there were some questions from some of the representatives on the hearing panel for that, and there wasn't really a clear answer, but I think that's looking quite a way into the future, and it extends into probably Te Waimotu and Cambridge, if it ever came to fruition, so no further south than that.  National policy statement in development, so we've got a plan change underway at our council, which will come to shortly, and at a future proof level, they've released an update of the feasibility development capacity, and that's going to flow through into changes to the district plan and the regional policy statement for what they call housing minimum bottom lines. So that's a requirement that we have to put into the district plan, and it just  pretty much sets what our minimum housing capacity is, and it's what we're expected, and we will get up for that in my part. I know Kirstie's got an item later on, on the spatial plan, so I won't cover that off. So under item six of the agenda for this report, the e-plan is a project that we're working on. So what that does is that takes our district plan and puts it into a,  I guess a bit much more user friendly component where you can interact with it on a map based GIS platform. And for example, it means when this rolls out and we're looking at early 2022 rolling this out, you'll be able to go and, for example, put in a property address and it should show all the rules that apply to that property. Or another example of how you can use it is you can go in, put in your address and say, put in a keyword like second unit, second house.  and it will show you all the rules that apply. So it's a much smarter way of understanding the rule framework that we've got at the moment, and it should help inform a lot of people wanting to do things. And in terms of national direction and RMA reform, so I talked about the National Policy Statement for Urban Development. There is a bill, and you'll be familiar with it, the Housing Enablement Bill. I understand it passed its second reading in Parliament yesterday.  We did put a submission on it, so that's the one that's proposing to allow up to three houses, up to three houses of up to three storeys on all residential zones and tier one councils. So our reading is that it applies to Waipa in our residential zones, but only obviously because it's large lot residential, the growth areas there, it won't apply to. That's the proposal at the moment. It's looking almost certain that it'll go through,  So the second reading I heard on the radio this morning that both of the major parties were backing up the amendments. So you can probably anticipate that'll go through with amendments. And the amendments will be probably that will confirm that we will be mandated to put in medium density residential standards in our residential zones. And the areas that are mostly affected will be Te Aumuri and Cambridge. So it will be a whole new world because it's fast tracking housing  At a level that we haven't really seen in this country, and there's quite a lot of concerns with practitioners around what that will leave us in terms of legacy of design. And just just the way communities run so. We're not quite sure what they will deliver, but we can expect it will be mandated under legislation to do that soon. We've got a number of plan changes that are rolling out, so a couple that you might be interested in. I won't go through the full list.  Plan Change 18, so that's to make it easier to keep bees in residential zones, and that includes large slot residential zones. So the district plan at the moment has some rules in there which are pretty ineffective. And we're preparing a bylaw which will take the rules out of the plan and will open up beekeeping in those zones. And I talked about Plan Change 21, which is our council's urban intensification plan change. So we've got that going on.  they will come together quite nicely. So we're quite well set up in Waip\u0101 because we didn't anticipate the bill coming out, but we sort of front footed some of the intensification we needed to do. So we've got a happy accident here, I suppose, where we can use our plan change to implement some of that legislation that we expect to come through. In the resource consent space, there's quite a lot of activity. I guess both the resource consent and the building consent  Applications are higher than they have been. We just like sort of unprecedented coming up frequently just in terms of the volume of applications we're seeing in both resource consents and building consents. We are seeing increased interest and applications coming through and being granted for intensification. Even when they're out of size, even with a compact housing, but not in the compact housing overlays. And they are merit based approvals. So we go through a process of assessment  Some of them have gone to hearings and they've been tested through evidence.

    "text": " I think it is working well. We've had a couple where there's been a bit of media interest. There's one in Coleridge Street, both in Cambridge, and there's another one after that in Taylor Street, I think, and both of them generate a little bit of media interest. They were from people, I suppose, who were interested or affected parties who really just didn't agree with the outcome. And, you know, people are entitled to do that, but  they kind of took it to the next level and started, I guess, lobbying against a decision that council commissioners had made. So, you know, people are entitled to disagree. And our stance when we get those sort of responses, and these aren't the first ones we've had, is we follow due process and we've got to really abide by the outcome and the decision that's been made. And it gets tested, you know, it gets tested through a hearing process, or it's not a hearing process, certainly,  The staff look at it very closely. We get expert urban design input if we need that. We get expert engineering traffic advice if we need that. So I'm reasonably confident, yeah, Bruce, that the system is working okay. Which, again, is part of all the council's feedback to government around the Housing and Neighbourhood Bill. A lot of councils, not just Waipa, have responded proactively like this. And so we are wondering,  why the government is wanting to impose additional fast track measures where councils by and large have pretty much responded in quite a positive way and developers have sort of taken up that opportunity as well. So we've got the housing amendment bill coming over the top. We're not quite sure if it's actually needed, but I guess time will tell. What else can I say about those? So volumes are all up.  In terms of the enforcement space, that's in the report there, so I won't go into that too much. And of course, in terms of development, you'll be aware of some of the large lot subdivisions that are underway in Porongia, and also in the Ohiopo-Grace cell as well. I think that's pretty much it, Madam Chair, so happy to take any questions.",

So what that means is in the Waipa 2050 growth,  strategy and in our district plan that scheduled for growth after 2035.

So firstly, I think it's important to note that while many buildings don't comply with the requirements of the current building code, because this changes over time. So I think that's the first point to note that a lot of them don't comply with the current building code because this does change significantly over time. The requirement to upgrade though,  if it doesn't comply, is only triggered when there's a change of use of the building or when a building is altered and a building consent is required. In these instances, upgrades are generally required for means of escape from fire. So that would be if you didn't have a fire alarm and you needed to under the current code, you'd have to install fire alarms and emergency lighting, those sorts of things. And the other compulsory requirement is when there's an upgrade or a change of use is access and facilities for people with disabilities. And that includes ramps and disabled toilets.  In all other respects, the building has to continue to comply with the building code to at least the same extent as before the alteration. So that's an important point to make. Just because a building doesn't comply with the current code doesn't mean that that's an issue. If a building contains specified systems,  And they are things like if there are no specified systems within a building, build a B1.",

So under the current building code. In a building such as  buildings built under, you know, sort of greater occupancy numbers. So where the occupancy numbers are unknown, the only way you can really get a good idea of the halls' capacity. So in most buildings, it's normally on the BWOF or it's on a fire report when the building was originally built. However, a lot of our halls are very old and those documents don't exist.  Finally, and the final point I just wanted to make is that all halls should contain fire evacuation schemes or something that actually advises occupants what to do in the event of a fire. So if there was a fire alarm, it would say where that was, it would have a plan showing the sort of fire exits, that type of thing.  So yeah, they're the key points in the paper.

So if I can just briefly talk to the report and then Vanessa will lead through a PowerPoint presentation. So in your agenda, you've been provided with a staff report and the purpose of this really is to provide you with a brief introduction to the development of the district wide community spatial plan.  It outlines what it is, why we're doing it, where it will sit in the hierarchy of documents that council has developed and implements. But look, I think the best way for us to work through that with you is for Vanessa to now share her screen and take you through a brief presentation and absolutely happy for you to ask us any questions either as we work through the slides or at the end.

I'm hoping in year three of this pandemic I will actually get better, but it feels as chaotic as my first Zoom meeting back in 2020. Okay, bear with me a second. Can I see?  This is OK, great. Sorry about this. My name is Vanessa Honor\u00e9, kia ora koutou to everyone. As Kirsty mentioned, I'm the Senior Strategic Planner at WIPA District Council and I'm also the Project Manager and Co-Technical Lead for the WIPA Community Spatial Plan, but I will be introducing  to you all today. I apologize for some of the councillors like Bruce, you would have seen actually some of those slides before. And please, this is really an informal update at this stage and I'm really open to have kind of an open discussion if it comes to it. So if I don't see raising your hands, I'm hoping  Madam Chair, you can support in this or Kirsty yourself can look into that. Fantastic. So the purpose of today's update is to obviously provide you with an introduction and an overview of the development of the committee's spatial plan to date. It's also to explore the opportunities that we might have in 2022  to gather and capture peer and peer work committee feedbacks on the spatial plan. As we go along, there is actually an engagement plan that will actually start up at the start January, February next year. And we can talk about this a little bit later in the presentation. And obviously, as I said, an opportunity for an open discussion and for to receive actually feedback.  So a little bit of the background of the spatial plan because that's something which is quite new in New Zealand and why do we actually need one in WIPO. So spatial plan there is quite maybe another use of the word itself it can be called also a master plan it can be also called a strategic plan and all those words can are interchangeable  And they mean actually the same thing. This is really to set direction at the portfolio level for any kind of activity or investments that we need to look at from the four well-beings for economic, environmental, cultural and social.  And when I mean actually long term, we're looking at 30 years within the plan, within NYE, on 50 years. And it happens that some spatial plans do also look at 100 years ahead.  When we look at Manufaenuan Iwi management plans, some will actually look at seven generations ahead. So we're looking really long term, projecting ourselves into what WIPA could look like in 2050 and beyond.  So we have a set of feature that we need to kind of go through when you actually scope for a spatial plan and I will go into this in a minute. And the first why do we need one. And I think we all heard from from 20 quick full presentation, you know, developers are knocking at  be looking to develop further the few amount of places that we have, and remain, and develop at this stage, we're looking at, you know, and some areas like Pyrongia for example,  We did the concept plan refresh last year and we've got about 230 more residents. Dwellings actually will be planned to be developed by the end of 2050. In Cambridge for example we've got actually the population which is forecasted to double. So how do we actually retain those four well-beings while there is so  so much changing around us. And that's really what the spatial plan is trying to do. How do we retain the vision, the community outcomes that we are set to deliver through all those changes? And how do we actually visualize those activities? How do we pass on the message to other entities, other organizations,  for them to know what are the main investments, what are the main priorities for us to achieve the vision and community, and that's really the purpose of a spatial plan, but of our spatial plan in particular.  As I was saying, there is a step by step. When you kind of start thinking of building a spatial plan, you look through all those kind of criteria, and you start defining a little bit more on how the spatial plan might actually look like. So as I said, I won't be looking at 30 years ahead with an eye on the 50 year plus, potentially.  We're looking at a district-wide document, but really one of the particularities of this spatial plan is retaining the concept of a collection of community, and I must stress this. This is quite particular when it comes to the spatial plan. We're going through play summaries, workshops with elected members at the moment,  we are really trying to retain this collection of communities and this collection of community identity within the district council as well. How can we actually retain those characters through the growth of the district?  From a level of detail, we want this to be, as Kirsty mentioned, it sits at a portfolio level, beyond before the strategy, before the district plan, before actually all the plans that we have at the moment. So we need to feed on from the documents who are currently existing and currently operative, but we also need this document to inform the future strategy and the future district plan.  From an engagement approach, it is completely in partnership with Manafinwa and Kirsty and I are completely devoted to make this point across actually the spatial plan. This is really important that Manafinwa come to the table and outline the aspiration as much as we do with the rest of our communities. So a high level of partnership with Manafinwa and Iwi, that's really what we're trying to strive for here.  Some of the outcomes, as I said, retaining those well beings while being pragmatic, we know that there will be a dial in and some calibration happening between, between all those four well being is we need to remain realistic and we need to remain pragmatic about this.  On the philosophy, we know that the achievement is to deliver on the vision and the committee outcomes that were set actually by previous long-term plans. Governance as well as the engagement approach, manifold and council-led.  And on the document itself, it needs, as I was saying, to provide direction and guidance to national entities and other organizations on what WIPA is promoting as being their priorities, almost like a manual of what WIPA will need to look like.  so they know exactly what kind of investment they are looking to provide to WIPA, but also a bit for our communities to think, OK, so there is a bit of a gap here for a project. I'm just going to see if this is something that we can do as a community as well. So something technical, but also completely legible by every one of us here as well.  And for the end product, we're really looking at almost like a web page, a site held almost like a one-shop website where anyone could actually get the information that they're looking for in the spatial plan.  How does they actually fit? Because yes, we have a lot of documents and you will be aware, there is so many and engagement as a moment and so many are asked by the communities. As I was saying, that's about the relationship of the spatial plan with other documents is really a lesson and informed. So knowing what actually the  those other plans are saying and what they are directing to, but also trying to inform the next one. But it will sit as a portfolio level, providing guidance to the rest of the plans and strategy in the future.  So a little bit on the project overview. So the project really started at the start of this year of 2021. And that's when we started actually phase one.  And that was really an evidence-gathering phase where we spent three to four months reviewing every document we could review within the WIPAC literature, if you want, looking at what were the main priorities for the Council.  Now we are entering, and I will talk a little bit about the outcome of phase one in the next slide. And then we entered phase two in September. Yeah, about September. So we're really at the start of the development of this project. And as I put right there, we're creating the community special plan. This is really what phase two is all about.  And in there, we're opening the doors to those two engagements. As I said, with Mana Fenoa, with key stakeholders. And I will talk about those two groups a little bit later on. We've done a lot of integration workshop and with WIPA district council managers and the business case writer. Those people who are creating those implementation projects at the bottom of the flow chart. And then obviously the wider community at the stage.  So as I said, Phase One ended up with outlining seven focus areas for the preparation of the Community Spatial Plan. And that line, I'm not going to go through the descriptive of each of them.  But they were, you know, usual suspects here. Our population change, our transport, our free waters, community facilities, vibrant communities will really actually reflect the economic side of what makes a community vibrant at any kind of scale, from Cambridge to Deparu. The natural environment, the cultural and heritage of each of those communities as well.  Then we entered phase two and we established four main workstreams.  to ensure that this partnership is delivered throughout the lifecycle of the project. We also are approaching a stakeholder engagement from a targeted approach, where we have appointed and are appointing a technical advisory group, but also a community stakeholder advisory group. And I will go into detail on to the next slide for those two advisory groups.  We also have the possible future scenario work stream, which is currently ongoing. And this is really about how a community might evolve in response to the changing key variables. And those key variables meaning population change, demographic change, and also economic change.  And then we've got the last one, which will come a little bit later in the life of the project, around April, March, which is really the preparation of the plan and how do we actually conceptualize and visualize all the work that would have been done by then. There is an evaluation of those possible future scenarios as well that we'll plug in there and that will establish a foundation for the community spatial plan.  And with it, with the preferred feature scenarios, obviously there is a set of intervention. There is a set of KPIs of key project indicators that we need to kind of establish to make sure that the spatial plan is a success, not only right now, but in five years and 10 years. Something measurable, tangible that we can actually measure so that we can see changes  and see our achievement to achieve a vision and the community outcomes as I mentioned earlier. Is there any question at this stage? No?",

    "text": "As I mentioned, our approach to engagement with the stakeholders is really kind of twofold. So we're having, we're appointing a technical advisory group, which is mainly,  representatives from ministries, national agencies, and all those agencies where we're looking to get actually some investments to be put in WIPOV over the next 30 years. And that's really to make sure that we align  our investment priorities to their financial agenda. We also have the appointment of a community stakeholder advisory group, and this is just so that we don't get lost into the technical aspects without actually forgetting about what we're doing this for.  and our community stakeholder advisory group are there to really make sure and ensure that the project team and the development of a community spatial plan retain the social, environmental, cultural and economic well-being at heart.  A little bit on the deliverables. So we have an ambitious timeframe. We're looking to finalize the project by the end of year 2022. October is our target at this stage, but we have a lot of work to do. And I've tried to outline there when we will be actually looking at bringing stakeholders  into the mix, but also when we will be bringing the wider community consultation. So just to outline, the fact is that this project is very dynamic. It has already changed from what we had planned in phase one, and it's quite a complex technical kind of level of input as well.  So we really, the ideas, the approach that we have with stakeholder advisory group is for us to, is for them to actually lift that technical input before we go to the wider committee engagement. So that we have something a little bit more tangible, something clear and something evident by the time that it gets onto the wider committee for consultation.  Do you have any question at this stage as well? Because we're getting to my last slide.",

And so we're reporting into a project control group, which has elected member representation, our mayor, deputy mayor, and chair of strategic planning and policy committee, as well as mana whenua iwi representation and project team representation. And we've identified this as a risk, but one that we will actively manage and mitigate. So as Vanessa said, we are  Confident that there will be sufficient engagement, clarity, and detail that this will be progressed to the point where come October 2022, we will have buy-in, but also there will be enough detail to inform those business cases for the development of the next long-term plan, and those business cases will kick off in October 2022.  So we will continue to report through to our PCG and also through to our Audit and Risk Committee and elected members as a collective on how we're tracking against the project plan. Thanks, Kirsty.",

And we're also reviewing a number of strategies, transportation, environment, economic well-being, as well as the work that we're doing in this space with the Community Spatial Plan. So we're looking at how we might bring that together with the likes of a bit of a council expo. And in terms of the planning that sits beneath  what is, I guess, the detail, we are looking at coming to the Pirongia community specifically as part of that engagement process.

So the good news is that Finance and I agree with how much money is in the budget there. There are a couple of things that I was wondering, wanting to take further. So in the prior year commitments, which is on page three of the report,  There's $2,500 which was set aside for the Pirongia public toilets upgrade. So in the end, they did not require this funding. They managed to find funding from elsewhere and they did not require that $2,500.  There's that, and there's also Pirongi Place Centre has, they took some, it's got some money last year from the committee. They've used all the money that they need, and there's $180 that isn't required. I've got it in writing that they do not require that $180. So I was wondering whether we could,  My staff recommendation is that we return that $2,500 and the $180 to uncommitted funds. Also in that line, there is that $1,000 that was set aside for the book for Mount Pirongia. At the moment, we're doing a bit of research because I'm pretty sure that the invoice has come through.  Finance isn't so sure, so we could just do a bit more follow up to confirm on that one, whether that, because technically that falls outside of the 12 months that we have, limit that we have on the funding.",

So the Te Aumutu Bible Chapel has cancelled this year's Light Party.  aiming to hold it again, which is an annual event in Te Awamutu. They're hoping, again, COVID permitting, that it'll be able to go ahead next year. So they were wondering if the $1,000, sorry, I can't remember off the top of my head,  The $1,000 that the committee gave them this year, if we could, if they could, if the committee could like defer it to the 2022 year. That's the first one. The second one, Pirongi School was allocated $1,500. Again, COVID has stepped in. Now, some of the funding for that $1,500 was to teach students, to be able to work with students in the pool.  but some of it was also to be able to open the pool up to the community. Now the community side of things, they have since decided not to open up the pool to the community over the summer holidays, hoping maybe there may be a chance to open it up once school returns, but certainly it is closed over the summer holidays. So  What they're saying here is these are our circumstances. Does the committee want to still give them $1,500 or do you want to make it less or what?",

Okay, so the recommendation is that the Pirongi Ward Committee receive the requests  regarding discretionary funding from Te Umutu, Bible Chapel, and Purongi School. So would someone just move those as well? Yeah, because we've had different people for each one, I think. So thank you, Ellen, and someone else that we haven't had before. Yeah, is that Andrew?",

The date of the next meeting of the Pirongi Award Committee is Wednesday, the 13th of April, starting at four o'clock. So I hope that suits people. It's a little bit different in timing because we're trying to align with the second funding round that's available to the other community boards. And yeah, so that's why it's a bit later than usual.
