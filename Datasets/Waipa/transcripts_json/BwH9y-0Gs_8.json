Welcome to everyone and hey, I suppose, although we're a month deep into 2022, happy new year. It's a bit kind of odd saying it now, seeing as it's the 1st of February, but it's the first time a lot of us have seen each other. So hope you're all well rested and had a great break and ready to rip into what looks to be a pretty  pretty full on year. So without any further ado, let's turn to our agenda. First off the cab, first cab off rank, obviously apologies. Now we have a recorded leave of absence from Councillor Barnes and apologies from Mayor Jim and Marietta. And I understand Lou, Councillor Lou Brown will be leaving at 10 a.m. and will return at some point when he finishes a meeting.  which we're interested to hear the outcome of, is that right? Yep, great. So do I have somebody who's happy to move those? Luke, Alwyn, and Mike Pettit can second that. All those in favour say aye.",

I've since had a phone call and I see the comments from staff are looking favourable. I believe when this by-law was proposed, pet pigs, so I'm talking about pigs, had not been taken into consideration. So yeah, I thank you for listening.  I just wanted to briefly talk to reiterate my submission. I have a pet pig. His name is Douglas. I got him in 2017. He was three weeks old and he will be five years old tomorrow. At the time I got him, I was on a large lot residential half acre property. So plenty of space, but due to a personal circumstance change, I had to sell that property and  had to find something more suitable for him. So I found a thousand square metre section. I'm surrounded by, bordered by five neighbours and everybody knows him. They talk to him over the fence, they throw him fruit and vegetables on occasion. He is, my section's fully fenced, fully secure, 1.5 metre fencing all the way around.  He was castrated as a piglet, he's not for breeding, he's not for eating, he's literally just a pet. He's vaccinated for lepto, treated for parasites. I keep his area very clean, he doesn't have a pigsty. I also have a horse that borders, there's a paddock beside me, there's a horse there, there's a cow on the other side, so having livestock around is pretty normal in these areas in Kehikehi.  So basically, yeah, he's just, I'm a responsible pet owner. I've got dogs as well. I've never had a complaint about any of my animals. As I say, my neighbours are absolutely fine with my pig and they say they don't even know he's there most of the time. So I just thank you for hearing me and I welcome any questions or concerns that councillors may have. Thank you, Sarah.",

    "text": " Awesome. M\u014drena koutou. Apologies that I was late. I had a couple of technical issues to get on this morning, out of practice. So very quickly, we, as the Te Amaru Community Board, largely supported the nuisance bylaw. We think it is a good move to give us some opportunity to target those people that aren't looking after their pets properly and are a nuisance.  Graham asked me in regard to our chicken numbers. I just wanted to clarify that. A few people suggested that, not a lot, but if we've got a bit of flexibility possibly in the bylaw, that's going to overcome five, six chickens. Apparently it's a chicken thing, but I've since talked to a few more people and they've told me I'll  the people you buy off are quite flexible. You can buy one or four. So even though we had put that in base, I just wanted to let you know, we'd put that up based on a few people's feedback. We thought it should include the industrial area, which we put in there. I did have a quick question around large lot. And that was, if someone has a large lot section within the residential zone,  Are we going to treat them the same as our large lot, even though they are zoned residential? Because they've got a bit more land, does that enable them to have a few more animals? I did see that there's been this cats topic brought up again, and I wondered if that maybe the cats should be included again, if they are being a nuisance, because I know I have a friend who has  half a dozen cats and they aren't a problem at all. However, I imagine there's other people who have a gazillion cats and are constantly in the neighbour's property, defecating and doing, you know, eating their birds, etc. So that brings me to my last point, and that sort of supports what Sarah was saying. And both Councillor Webber and Councillor Brown  alluded to, and I'd been wondering about this morning particularly, around are we able to have something in our nuisance bylaw that says these are the conditions, however, that we have an exception bylaw that says if you meet these criteria, there's good shade, no one's complaining about your animals, they don't have any offensive smells that are upsetting the neighbours, they're not making any  additional noise that those people then can have six chickens instead of five or have a pet pig or a pet crocodile, you know, whatever the odd pet might be. And then that way we're adding some flexibility into our bylaw that supports the people that are, you know, good and caring pet owners rather than  as Sarah mentioned, that we're catching them in the spy law and they're actually infringing it, even though they are really good pet owners. So that's pretty much me. But yeah, I'd love to possibly see some flexibility in there. So thank you. I hope you guys have all had a wonderful break and holiday, and we look forward to seeing you again for an exciting year ahead. So thanks very much. Thanks, Anne.",

    "text": "Good morning, everyone. And thank you again for the opportunity to speak to my submissions on the proposed bylaw in relation to beekeeping. I think my views are quite clear. I've been involved in the process to get this bylaw  for over two years, and it has been a long drawn out process. I had hoped to be able to speak positively about the resulting bylaw that is in front of you today. Instead,  I'm calling for the beekeeping section to be scrapped completely and for staff to start again and this time actually listen to experienced beekeepers about how best to mitigate nuisance from bees. As was the case nine years ago, staff have completely ignored expert beekeeper advice and created rules that are still not fit for purpose.  Of critical note, staff have come very close to slandering Hamilton City Council animal control staff in an attempt to mislead you into thinking this bylaw is good. Can I point councillors to the summary of submissions with staff comments and recommendations? In the first staff comments to my submission and on others, staff have written, and I quote, staff are aware that Hamilton City Council's approach is causing problems for their enforcement  who have more limited tools for managing problems of nuisance caused by bees. When I read that last week, I emailed Susan Stanford, Hamilton's animal education and control manager, about those comments to ask if it was true. Her reply on Friday was, and I quote, thank you for your email. It was enlightening to read. While mediating outcomes and bee complaints requires tact and diplomacy, it is no more difficult  than managing many of the complaints we get. I am confident we have sound processes when managing bee complaints. We had one complainant who was not happy with the outcome and took the case to the ombudsman. The ombudsman found in favour of Hamilton City Council, which reassured us that we had sound processes that are fair to both beekeeper and complainant. I am trying to contact Waip\u0101 District Council to see where they have sourced their information from. Regards, Susan.\"  In the same comment, again repeated a few times in the document, and I paraphrase here, having no regulations favours beekeepers, but provides no redress for complaining neighbours should nuisance occur. Hamilton City Council most definitely proved that assertion completely false. It seems Waipae District Council staff don't know how to use tact and diplomacy, so try and completely trash the process that has worked for Hamilton City Council for many years.  There are many other staff comments that need addressing, but unfortunately, five minutes is not enough to go through them. WDC staff comments to mine and other submissions is quite frankly disgraceful and certainly misleading to councillors who will now have an incorrect view of Hamilton's handling of bee complaints and a misleading view of the bylaw before you today. With regard to other expert submissions, staff have ignored the advice and recommendations submitted in favour  of another document that is, again, not fit for purpose. If the current version is passed, it will basically eliminate beekeeping in your urban areas. That cannot be accepted. Staff need to understand that beekeeping is vital to every town and city. They need to understand beekeeping from beekeepers, and they need to learn to use tactical diplomacy to deal with the few complaints that occur in your town. Sixty-six percent of councils in New Zealand have no restrictions.  and they all manage complaints easily. So could Waip\u0101's staff if they actually learned from expert submissions and said it's trying to mislead you all. Please don't make the same mistake as eight years ago. Scrap this proposed bylaw and either requiring your staff to work with experienced beekeepers to create a bylaw that reflects actual beekeeping, or better still, change the title of Hamilton's Animal Nuisance Bylaw and be done with it. That was my first recommendation two years ago and it still stands.  This current proposed bylaw is only fit for the rubbish bin. Thank you.",

I was actually talking to animal control in Hamilton City Council just to see just what misunderstanding was. And it appears that misunderstanding is simply that it seems to be in quantum.  that we probably understood there to be more issues with beekeeping in Hamilton than there actually have been. It seems as though there aren't really the issues in Hamilton that we were led to believe.  And so that dialogue has started, and we'll probably just continue that to find out just a little bit more as to how they are managing it. Where the source of our information came from, I can't actually recall now. Obviously, there have been a number of people who have had inputs to this bylaw.  including people on the staff who have been or have partners who are involved in beekeeping. So it's not that we haven't had anybody with no knowledge at all involved in this bylaw. I don't know if Jo is able to add anything more to that.  I know we have based this bylaw on those from other councils as well, so it's not as if we've just made this up as we've gone along.

    "text": " That's because of the restrictions that are in there. The main one is location from boundary. I mean, if you've got relatively small sections that are and the beekeepers required to keep the hives five metres from a boundary, that basically puts it under the washing line or right in the middle of the lawn, which is just ridiculous. It makes no sense whatsoever. And it's things like that that is clear that council staff don't understand.  that fits fence height that is more critical than location on the property. And that variable, five metres and three metres, depending on fence height, if you understand and actually watch bees, fence height is the issue, not location. And you're requiring people to put their hives right in the middle of their lawns, which makes no sense. And people are just gonna give up if that's what's gonna be bought. Can I just add in here, just on that note,  When the rules were in the district plan, there were very, very, very few complaints. You had up to 400 hives in Te Amutu and Cambridge with almost no issues. There were occasionally complaints, but no complaints except one person who I helped through the process of the resource consent. One person had a permit. All other 400 hives didn't.  have no rules, no restrictions, except basic nuisance. If a nuisance occurs, we will go and do it on a case-by-case basis and work out mitigation for that. It works. You do not need these restrictions. Greg Morgan Thanks for that clarification, Phil.",

    "text": "Thanks for taking the time to hear me.  I'm on a totally different subject again, it's been quite a diverse range of submitters this morning. I'm here to talk about cats, as you know from my submission. I'd like to just start by giving you a picture of my experience with animals bylaws. Just last year alone, I submitted on every single animals bylaw notified in the North Island, and I assisted with two in the South Island.  So, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of what's going on, particularly in the North Island regarding these bylaws. And I tried to get clarification, but I haven't had a reply from Council yet. But I understand that Waip\u0101  did not run any form of survey of the community ahead of this process, nor did I get the impression it consulted any focus groups. Certainly that wasn't stated in the statement of proposal. And so in my experience, most councils do run some kind of pre-consultation because then they draft a bylaw that's most appropriate to the district. And maybe the concerns around bees is testament to that.  In my experience, every council that surveys the community ahead of notifying its animals bylaw has cats raised as a topic of concern from stray cat colonies, people illegally dumping in public reserves, nuisance cats defecating in sand pits, tomcats fighting at night, et cetera. The list is endless. Cat nuisance is a genuine concern across New Zealand and simply having a generic nuisance clause in your bylaw  doesn't go far enough to truly address the issue. I do contend that your officer's claim is incorrect, that this bylaw can't include rules for cats. They've stated that because this bylaw is based upon transferring into bylaw form some existing district plan rules regarding animals in urban areas, that these rules do not include cats. So therefore it's not possible to include the rules in this bylaw,  I would suggest that that's a red herring because in the context of this bylaw, it's been issued under the Local Government Act and not the RMA. So WIPA has every ability to introduce rules specific to cats in this bylaw, as demonstrated by many other councils who have done exactly that. In fact, WIPA's enforcement officers need stronger regulation so that when a nuisance occurs,  they have the power to actually reduce the nuisance. When cats aren't microchipped, for example, the officers won't have any way of knowing who owns the nuisance cats, thereby making their ability to abate the nuisance even more difficult. Similarly, research has indicated that return to owner rates of cats that are microchipped is 20 times higher than for cats that are not. I'd like to point out that cat regulation is not a big deal.  Not only is it desired by the community, it's also well-supported. Just to give you an example, in Taupo District last year, the council proposed nuisance regulation after hearing the concerns of its residents. Not only did 92% of submitters support the proposed regulation, many called on the council to do more in a similar vein to what Forest and Bird has proposed in its by-law submission to WIPA, such as compulsory microchipping, de-sexing, and a three-cat limit.  In Whangarei, a district that has a cat problem, in their statement of proposal, they made it clear they weren't proposing specific regulation, but kept the door open to submitters who may have had a view. Their statement of proposal invited community views on matters relating to keeping of cats and feedback on the possible options for cat management. And Whangarei District Council wasn't proposing changes relating to cats in its amended bylaw, but options were considered as part of the bylaw review.  some sort of by-law regulation was within the scope of the consultation, I suggest the process run by WIPA has done a disservice to WIPA residents. By only consulting on a narrow scope, residents weren't really even aware that animals by-laws are in fact absolutely an appropriate place to regulate cats, that many councils are regulating cats through their animals by-laws and that strict regulation is being passed in other districts and no one is batting an eyelid. In 2020,  Whanganui District Council passed the strictest cat regulation in the country and even Companion Animals New Zealand was completely in support. You'll find that forest and bird and the animal protection groups are actually all on the same page. We all want the best outcomes for the cats. We just want them to be managed such that their impact on our wildlife is minimized. So we implore you to include stricter cat regulation in this bylaw and not fall behind those councils showing genuine leadership in this space. That's all I had to say.  Thank you.",

It's about so I feel like council officers feel that they're limited to the nuisance issue. And so then when you get into the  discussion around stray cat colonies, they're all worried about cost of enforcement. And time and time again, the first question I get asked is, how do you want us to enforce this? And I always say, it's about nuisance. So you only enforce it when the nuisance complaint comes in. It's not like we're asking you to be the police and go around door to door saying, have you got three cats on your property or fewer? And you're not gonna go around confiscating cats.  It's just about responding to nuisance and having the power to do something meaningful about the nuisance when the complaint comes in. Ideally, you would also be in your long-term plans allocating cash to control stray cat colonies. But as I understand, the only council in the country doing that with any gusto is Wellington City.",

We have special regulations for dogs and perhaps we can look at something along. You're talking of cats. It's a pretty difficult thing to herd or do with cats, but we'd have to actually ask our local community if we got enough support  to do this, the idea of this legislation was to look at the nuisance value. And I keep raising that, the nuisance value of what things are happening. So if somebody has cats or a proliferation of cats, you could actually have a nuisance and therefore operate under the law. The second thing I'd like to raise is, of course, not all cats are domestic. There's huge amounts of feral cats out there. How do we, what do we do? I mean, we can't, it's like feral rabbits. It's like feral possums.  We can't have poisoning programs without having some sort of thing. So this could be a separate piece of legislation that should be raised. It can't, I think, come under this act as it is operating at the moment. Just ask you to think about that, because we're just looking at a nuisance value and operating under that. Thank you.

I would suggest that we're not asking Waip\u0101 District Council to  impose regulation on feral cats because that's actually not your purview that's regional council's job it should be in their regional pest management plan. So this is about nuisance cats stray cats come a little bit grey area but they do technically come under nuisance regulation too so just because they're not owned doesn't mean they're not posing nuisance and so having  and that comes with complication because, of course, if stray cat colonies do emerge in Kihikihi or somewhere, there may well be microchipped cats or owned cats within those stray cat colonies just, you know, chancing it on some food that they're getting fed. And if you then send in your officers to go and catch and, I don't know, rehome or euthanise those cats without any regulation requiring microchipping, then you could well be  rehoming someone's pet cat that happened to be caught up in a stray cat colony. So this, we're just asking for clarity around what a cat is, whether it's, and if it's owned, it should be microchipped, de-sexed ideally, and I know that comes with cost. And so many councils have a subsidised de-sexing programme that they just put within their overall cat control budget or, you know, what do you call it? Compliance and enforcement budget.",

And the decision on that plan change was that the district plan wasn't the best place for them, they'd be better off in a bylaw.  and that they would be removed from the district plan when a bylaw is made. So that was why we started this process of making this bylaw. It was originally just for bees, but on the advice of the district plan team and the animal control team and others, we thought that  If the district plan isn't the right place for beekeeping provisions, it probably isn't the right place for poultry and pig keeping provisions as well. So we thought rather than go through that whole district plan change process again, let's put all those animal keeping provisions into this one bylaw and do it in one go. So this really is a case of moving the rules  from one instrument to another. And that was really all this bylaw was about. I don't know if, I think Carl's online and he might have something to be able to input us to some of the comments that we've had or number of comments we might've had around issues of cats and so on, or whether anyone else in the team, I've got Joe Cook-Monroe here from the team.  Diana's here from the legal side, Tony's here as well, whether they've got any input on this background as well.",

Anecdotally, I don't have statistics in front of me, but we're probably more likely to receive complaints about chickens and other animals rather than cats. Having said that, part of that will be because people know we don't have a provision specific to cats.  a number of those complaints may go to other agencies. So as was commented earlier, if we're talking about feral and wildcats, that sits with another agency. If we're talking about animal welfare type issues, they sit with another agency. So council scope in that is quite limited anyway. So to say we don't have a lot of complaints, we don't, but that's partly the reason.

The feedback from the team when we were looking at the B issues specifically and moving them out of the district plan into the by-law, the general feedback was that it wasn't a topic that had caused too much concern in the sense that the district plan rules had not been enforced on a significant number of times and therefore it wasn't  wasn't seen as significant. Most of the inquiries around other animals relate to how many you can keep and those sort of things. So particularly around the poultry, chickens, etc. Most inquiries we get are more around that number. We do get a significant number  when I say significant, more than other animals around things like feral roosters and those things usually again because they have been left in council reserves and those sort of issues. So again, we've got to separate between animals being kept and animals that are wild and  and feral, so we get the whole range. These rules will be looking more particularly at animals that have been kept. Certainly that's the way the district plan is written at the moment. We're talking about animals that have been kept rather than wild, feral, dumped animals. So again, the numbers are very small. I think on your agenda this morning, you've got the quarterly enforcement report, so it may have a table in it summarising what the stats were over the last quarter.  So Cal, you talk about animals being kept and it appears from what you're saying that chooks have the most common reports of being a so-called nuisance.",

So the reason that this has moved into by-law without a question is because there's quite a lot of  interest and it was generated by Mr Evans and I guess initiated by him in terms of the effectiveness of having a bee, specifically a bee control in the district plan. The research that we did, and it was a previous staff member who's now finished, did confirm that the complaints were very low and we came to the conclusion pretty quickly that it's an ineffective rule where  A, there's nothing, there's not a nuisance that we need to control. And then B, when those very rare events come in, they're very easily resolved. And the third one is, we only had one consent. There's something like, top of my mind again, there was 250 BIs we were aware of in the district. One person applied for resource consent. So that tells us pretty quickly that there's an inefficient rule in the district plan. And so at the hearing, the determination was made by the commissioners who heard that plan change.  that the bylaw was the best course of action. So this is really a consequential change arising from the decision of the commissions on what was Plan Change 18. So hopefully that's helped.",

That's still a plan change that we still have to work through. We haven't made the determinations, and there's a separate report coming to SPMP this morning on that. So while there is a link there between intensification, the way I would be recommending that the committee thinks about it is assume intensification as it exists at the moment.  don't assume that there'll be three houses on every three section, because we haven't made that decision yet. So that leads us with Councillor Gordon's question, is that there's a general intensification trend that we're seeing across the district. And so with that in mind, it is probably appropriate to limit the number of hives. The other point I'd make too, is two hives at the evidence, at the hearing, two hives is generally sufficient for hobby beekeeping. We also need to consider the commercial element.  if you start getting unlimited number of hires, then you become a business and you have a commercial element and a residential zone, and then that takes into a whole different realm. So that's worth considering.",

So it'll be quite interesting to sort of hear the outcome of this, that maybe it wasn't quite what we originally thought.  The other one is the five metre thing in the fence height. So Phil obviously knows, he's one of those experts, there's many experts, I'm sure they've all got different opinions, but it seems to me that five metres, I do pick up what he's saying with the small sections, regardless of the intensification of the sections,  this is the current one, five metres of each boundary seems really excessive. And maybe that number could be looked at, that could be reduced, but there could still be a number, could be a metre and a half or two metres. But the other thing is the fence height thing. So I'd like some real definitive answer on, he was quite clear that the fence height directed the bees in terms of where they, I guess, enter and exit the hive had far more impact than the  the setback of five, five metres. So, you know, I'm personally struggling to think that this thing is ready to be passed today, or at least for me. But a couple of answers around that, around the setbacks.",

Mr Evans' submission this morning is consistent with the evidence that we had  Mr. Evans, we had another submitter at Plan Change 18 who was a lecturer in beekeeping at the University of Waikato. And we commissioned an independent expert at that hearing to advise the council commissioners. So it is consistent with the evidence presented at Plan Change 18 on two counts. So one is, and this was a new thing for me to say, fence height does appear to be the containing factor around bee flight.  and their movement. And so setbacks become less important with the evidence that was presented. And that fact that in part of the deliberations of the committee from memory, or the commissions from memory on Plan Change 18.

I don't know, sometimes pacing slowly can be the best way to actually get something right. Now I'm really wondering, I guess I'll finish with the last question.

So our timescales aren't quite so long.  But in terms of investigating further the B question, what I am, is that we can look at that again. But I am picking up conflicting information as to whether fence height's important or not. We've got to bear in mind, remember that we had a discussion earlier in the process about fence height being two meters or 1.8 as per the district plan.  And then I was told that that wasn't important. Someone else is saying it is, and setbacks are important or not. So we've had to make a call on that, but we can look at it again.

So from what Tony said, there's been consistent expert evidence that the setback isn't the important thing, it's the fence height. And so I'm really in favour  of removing the requirement for a seat back. I just wanted to check with Jo, so her argument has been that we've got to think about intensification, but we still have, within the bylaw, that control around the size of the section. So the property has to be a minimum of 500 metres square, so if you have intensification, you might lose that sort of qualifying section size,  And so I would hope that that would be the safeguard, and because we've retained the safeguard, we should be able to do away with the setback requirement. We've been told that Hamilton City Council have done that, and they seem to be managing it without any major issues. So that would be my, I guess, request from Jim Doe, that if we retain 500 metres square,  requirement that could help us with being able to safely remove the setback requirement?",

Your best place for your hive is in the back corner of your section out of the way, but it won't worry the bees if you're 1.8 or 2. We should do away with the 2 and have the 1.8, which is a district plant. Your bees will always approach the hive from the least resistance.  always. They're not going to come out of the beehive and go straight up two meters. It just doesn't happen like that. It's like you taking the lower road instead of going over the hill. And the other thing is we might have to do with the cats is limit one cat per townhouse or unit, because if we're going to have all these houses built in a row, you've potentially got some real issues here.
