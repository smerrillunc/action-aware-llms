    "text": "Thank you. So I'll take my really short PowerPoint as read. I'll just  kind of acquaint you with where we're at with the economic wellbeing strategy. The strategy has been changed from an economic development strategy to an economic wellbeing to recognise a slight change in emphasis towards a greater wellbeing. And we're complying with the need for council to  adopts the four well-beings from government and the Local Government Act. So we've started the strategy. We're in targeted engagement with stakeholders, and this is part of engagement with stakeholders, business, elected members, councillors, community board, and iwi.  The aim is to work up a strategy for formal adoption in June by the Council. So the first stage, which is in progress, targeted engagement with stakeholders, and then drafting and stakeholder feedback. So we're still in the talk stage. I've started collecting  a few themes from our first few meetings, which I'm happy to go through shortly. So we've been gathering technical economic data. I can bury everybody in technical analysis and economic analysis. No two economists agree on the way things are looking. We're in a  interesting phase now with COVID has changed the expectation of business going forward and the business outlook. So it's a really appropriate time to update our 2012 strategy, which is, of course, now 10 years old. So our stakeholder and partner engagement is with  business owners, chambers, elected member, iwi consultative committee at the moment. And that's ongoing. The key sectors that we've identified loosely in the strategy, primary industry, food and agriculture, manufacturing, including agri-tech, technology, business professional services, education, high performance support, construction,  visitor and events. So those are the main sectors of interest. Our wellbeing priorities are across business and employment growth, the Maori economy, innovation and investment, workforce, education and training. So that's, yeah, that's it.  So, our aim is to work up a strategy that's fit for purpose in the current economic environment. And the strategy will align with the council's vision and community outcomes. So, over the last two years, we've engaged on community outcomes and we have a  a format for what is important to our community. So we want to ensure resilience and prosperity, economic well-being of the district, promote Waipara as an accessible and attractive place to do business, and identify opportunities for growth. So our engagement is with  partners, stakeholders, and elected members. We are not required to do a formal public consultation SCP process under the Local Government Act, but we know there's good community interest and business interest in our strategy, so we're looking for every opportunity to talk to people.  The emerging themes, let me list five of them so far, and then add a couple of sectors. So wellbeing outcomes, education, training, partnership, relationships, employment, and agriculture, primary industries. So added to that has been continued support for high performance sport,  support for events in the visitor industry. A suggestion from some quarters that we look at environmental sector businesses, education, aged health businesses, and the equine sector. That's a whole lot of sectors that I've just named. So if any, I can go through  the five themes in more detail, if you like. But let's just pause for some questions, comments.",

Just can you give me a little bit of more background of what this is that do my questions kind of around this? Do all district councils have a strategy similar to this?  And how much are you guided in what it looks like? You know, you were talking about the four well-beings. Do you have to be covering off those?  So just those couple of questions, just general background, because I'm struggling to understand it. And then finally, your emerging themes, most of them kind of hit me as sort of central government core business rather than district. So three sort of comments.",

They all have business development, people like me, or economic development groups, to a greater or lesser extent. Some councils use, some councils are lucky enough to have a trust running an economic development agency, like Grow Wellington, ATEED in Auckland, which is now called something else,  So yes, the four well-beings are enshrined in the Local Government Act, so council must give effect to the four well-beings, and economic well-being is one of those. So it's a statutory requirement that we have something around the strategy. Our current one is 2012,  It was created by a group of business stakeholders and elected members, quite a few workshops, and there's a copy on our website. I've actually done an outcome review from the original strategy, which is quite interesting to show how we've fulfilled the original strategy.  What were the other questions?",

We have the benefit of being next to a major metropolitan area linked with key corridors to Auckland. So it's important that WIPA contributes to outcomes in the regional and sub-regional economy as well. It's kind of a joined up approach to growth. So it's important that we work with central government and its agencies to get a good outcome for us.  In terms like, and the theme under employment, a lot of the businesses reported a massive skills and talent shortage. And we've got an environment of full employment, which makes finding workers difficult. So growing employment was important to our community and employment issues around youth training  Staircasing into employment was really important. Now, central government doesn't operate in our area really well. And so we've got to take the initiative around some of these issues. So we've got to manage our own partnership relations between business and council.  Our employment outcomes are important. We don't have to do everything, but we need to make sure that training as much as possible can be local. Not everybody needs to travel to a tertiary or to Hamilton for training. Things as simple as driver's license training. If left to the government, we probably wouldn't have any of that locally.  And our wellbeing outcomes, you know, many of our economies are taking a wellbeing focus, and that's a shift from measure for looking for added value growth outcomes, not just growth. And we'll be picking a range of kind of economic wellbeing indicators that kind of signpost our progress in that area.",

So I've worked with Alana and Elise to pull together the proposed guidelines.  So you'll see those there in front of you. So the criteria includes charities or community initiatives that Waip\u0101 District Council supports through funding or strategic partnerships, a private event that a town hall event has a town hall event booking and does not clash with preferential dates listed below, to mark a special national event milestone or celebration for a particular council run or partnered event, and as a symbol of respect or of solidarity with other global landmarks following guidance from central government.  And then, obviously, we've listed those preferential dates here that came up at the former meeting. So that includes Waitangi Day, Anzac Day, Easter, Matariki, Basil Day, Likanoi, Liberation and Armistice and Christmas.

And if I can just share my opinion, I understand there was some discussion at our last meeting that if they were available for private lighting, for private events, that that would potentially reduce the impact of lighting up the assets. In my opinion, I think having a vibrant CBD with a lot of activity,  would be a good thing. So if you drove through the town and it was lit up because there was a wedding on or there was a film theater or something, I don't see that as a negative thing. I see it as something that shows we have a vibrant township, vibrant CBD, and in fact would help to promote our town hall, which I think is good to promote. That is a really wonderful part of Cambridge. So we've left this intentionally vague  tonight so that we could just bring that idea to you all and see if there was strong opinion in regards to whether it remain exclusively for community groups and charities and then it would just be as simple as changing that note that says if  that you know the charity or community group needs to be aware if there's a private booking already happening in the hall and liaise with that with that group to make sure they're happy for it to be lit up because we don't want to light it up if someone's wedding is happening and they don't want it lit up so we just need to kind of make some modifications there but if if people are happy to that concept of there being available for private a private event  with the caveat that they meet the criteria around being able to meet the costs and they don't clash with any other of the preferential dates, then we can make it happen too. But I was happy just to, it wasn't clear where we were at with our guidelines. It wasn't really specific. And I thought we needed to probably nail down exactly what the expectation was there and then tighten this up, which we can probably do in this meeting without sending it back to council again.",

Just to your point, Elise, if you are happy for private individuals to start lighting up the town hall, I think you've just got to be careful with how far you go on this. I mean, would you want them to have a laser light show projecting home movies onto it, for example?  It is a continuum once you start to do private projections onto community assets.

So resourcing is a real issue for us at the moment. Take the report as read. It's a report till the 31st of December, 2021. I'll just go some of the Cambridge.  Matt Constable's iPhone 2.  Lease and services agreement was sent to them a couple of days before Christmas, I think. So they're getting that legally reviewed at the moment and hope to get some feedback on that in the not too distant future. Cambridge Museum, the roof needs replacing. So at the same time we do that, we will repair or fix up some of the seismic issues.  One of the major issues that drives the percentage of MBS is the parapet. So when the roof's off, we'll be fixing the parapet back to the structure, which will increase the percentage of MBS. And we'll also look at doing something with the chimney. So they were two of the major items that issues in relation to earthquake prone building.  So that works on going Cambridge Water Tower. We've been dealing with Heritage New Zealand. I think we've got a plan now. We believe we can remove the tower and the steel work at the top before it completely falls off. But we have to put a steel frame up there.  which replicates the size and how the tank used to be. So we're working through that. C1, C2 and C3 growth cells. The major infrastructure corridors have been acquired in C2.  through the 3Ms block, and also an agreement's in place for the infrastructure corridors through C3, which is a joint venture between St. Peter's School Trust and 3Ms. There's a whole heap of other acquisitions that are ongoing in that area. Cambridge Road, Hamilton Road, urbanisation, that's pretty well done from a property perspective. We've just got one,  or two pieces of land to tidy up on that. And then Eric from Roding can get those works underway. Hicks Road, that's the walkway to the northern enclosure that has been closed for about three years.  Um, Mr. Knighton managed to work all the time through Christmas and managed to get it open on New Year's Eve. So credit to Gary for sorting that out when he was, should have been on leave. Um, Mungatowtrie road cycleway. So as you're probably aware, we purchased state 59 Mungatowtrie road.  which is about 19 hectares adjoins Waipuki. So that was the final piece in the puzzle that we needed to have a contiguous route to Waipuki for Tiawa cycleway. So,  We've got the land, it's just a matter of now getting the funding in the LTP to tidy up that bit of extra track. So you'll be able to ride from Fukunui Stud to Waipuki within the Waipa Council boundary.  So as you probably saw the cycle way to the northern boundary was opened the other day. So get on your bike and go for a ride.",

And my view of the world is, we've got all these bits and pieces of buildings that aren't used all the time that perhaps you could build a community facility that had  you know, space that could be used. I know the Bridge Club like to have their tables permanently set up. So, you know, they're the sorts of things that you would need to take into consideration. But, you know, there may be a, you know, when I look around town, retail space that becomes available lasts about a day before it's picked, you know,  It's just a timeline to fit it out, really, to change the use. There's not much vacant around town, so is there an opportunity to do a development on that site? Get some car parking, get a development, get community facilities? I don't know. But then again, Cambridge is moving sort of that way. Should there be a library?  So they're all the things that need to be considered in the mix going forward. But as I say, there's no provision in this plan for anything. It was just that opportunity. And that opportunity, if we had got that, we'd have 850 square metres of office space here that we could have, you know, of library space here that we could have fitted out.

    "text": " Kia ora t\u0101tou, te hei M\u0101ori ora ki a koutou katoa. I'll just take you through a couple of the highlights from our report this last quarter. It was certainly another busy one for our community services wh\u0101nau.  Again, we continue to see high vandalism across our parks, now public toilets. As I described to SPMP yesterday, the damage has become what I would describe more intentional now rather than opportunistic with seeing things like arson and people bringing tools to cut and remove assets, way more graffiti and just a general disregard for  actually stick his belief at how some members of the community think that it's OK to sort of trash the assets and then leave a trail of destruction behind to be cleaned up. And as I just said, we're not sure of the of the reason why we're seeing this increase.  But one can only presume there's some sort of link to the fatigue and uncertainty of the last couple of years with COVID and now see potential escalation in the European countries.  We do have projects for some of our hotspots to address some of the issues that we've seen. We've always known that some of our more secluded or rural spots have a bit more higher vandalism, but as I said, that's even moving right into the urban areas now.  Pukimaku and Gaslight Theatre are two sites that we do have plans to do some more work in and we're working to get cameras in there. Some speed bumps have already gone into Pukimaku. There's some plan to go into Gaslight Theatre to slow the hoons that rip through there down a bit.  And then yesterday at the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee, they supported staff to look more closely at the Public Places By-law, which specifically for anti-social driving will be something that gives police and us a bit more teeth to, you know, catch these people and discipline them.  Libraries, just following on from what John was saying there, with that theme, we've had another very busy quarter. Quarter 2 did see the closure of the libraries while we were in Alert Level 4 there for a brief period of time.  But while we were in level 4, we were able to begin our click and collect service again. And then when we did open up in November and December, we saw some really high numbers of book issues through that period, which offset the lack of issues in October. When we moved to the COVID-19 protection framework,  We transitioned from the orange light to the red light, and obviously all of our council facilities required vaccine passports into the facility. So this did create a little bit of angst with some members of the public and the community, and the teams have done a really fantastic job of dealing with some of those difficult conversations. They're sort of the ones that wear the brunt of some of people's frustrations sometimes, so the team's done really, really well.  And even moving forward from when level 4 was, our click and collect service, especially in Cambridge, is continuing to see a strong demand and increase. I guess as Omicron kicks off and we start to move towards our peak, people are more inclined to use that service than otherwise.  In terms of our parks, our teams are struggling to recruit still. It's been a bit of an ongoing issue, especially for the parks team. Our reserve planner role at the moment has been vacant since early December, and it's one of our key roles to do a lot of our planning and future thinking work.  We're actually in the second round of recruitment for that role now. And we still have vacant mower operators and gardening roles. And to offset the vacancies in that thing, we've actually had to bring in some contractors to just help us keep up with level of service. So those are just a few highlights from the report. I'm happy to take any questions from anyone.",

I mean, kids can't even kick a ball properly there because of the awkward shape. But it's the only playground over this side of town, other than the one at Daunton Road. I mean, we've got this great big area out here, lots of kids, and we've got a dearth of playgrounds.  And I don't think that's good enough. And I don't think we've got enough on the other side either. I mean, ideally, people should be within sort of say half a kilometre's walk of a playground. We've got a whole heap of young families coming into the town. And they're living in houses, particularly over here in Cambridge North, where they've got damned old ground around them. You know, we need places for kids to actually be able to kick a ball, for them to be able to walk there.  I mean, what's the story? Gary might know. There's a big paddock beside the Oaks Village. Is that council property? Could we do something there? I mean, there must be somewhere and we should certainly be upping what we've got at the Tudor Drive playground.",

Essentially, yeah, there's lots to happen there. Obviously, just right now, in fact, this week we've kicked off the renewal of the Lake Te Kootu playground. That one there was becoming quite hazardous in terms of some of the equipment that was starting to fail. And Paul, our playground asset officer, he's done a really good job to nurse that through to now. So the junior module was done last year, and now we're doing that senior module now.  And then we do have plans for a destination playground somewhere on that northern town belt. There's also a playground identified on the corner of Terry Cane Drive and, oh it might even be, I forget what the road is there now, but right on the corner.",

Again, that's a destination size playground over that side that will cater to sort of that C2, a little bit of C3 and a little bit of C7 catchment.

They'll talk to their neighbors and whether or not they can erect a chalkboard and they can write up what can be harvested.  and then promote it through their network, like their sort of email out networks as well. And then where the main, sorry, the Berm Garden, that's been quite successful. The veggies are pre-harvested and she puts out a little sign. So I think the solution comes locally more so than broad kind of social media noise. I think it needs to come from that local community starting to  So if Marianne Gill, the reporter from the Cambridge News is watching this, you know, perhaps Marianne would like to do an article on our pop-up community gardens. Well, interestingly, we were in, it was featured in the, not this one just came out, but the February, February garden, New Zealand garden magazine, our pop-up gardens were featured in there along with some other Cambridge initiatives. So it's,  generally considered to be quite a positive thing to be doing in the community, and it will just keep finessing it and growing it, and it will develop its own presence in the community over time, kind of fed by the guardians, which is the goal.",

We thought the package with the postcards had gone missing, but it turns out they've got it and they're working on postcards to send back to Cambridge so we can distribute those back to the students that wrote, which is really cool. Yeah. I've also been in touch with Elizabeth from the museum. She's been really helpful. She's keen to  once we can have a look at the contents of those cabinets and the foyer at the council offices and see what's there and maybe develop some content around the stories relating to those items that are in there and when they were gifted and those kinds of things. She also has discovered a great collection of articles that they've got in their files at the museum from the establishment of the sister cities  and stories through time following those. So I'm gonna make a time to go into the museum and have a look at those and hopefully be able to share those with the community and help educate people on our sister cities. Also with the 70th anniversary of New Zealand-Japanese diplomatic relationships this year, the embassy has asked us among other areas with  Japanese sister cities to do little videos. So Graham Weber and Ayako and I have been working on those. So we've got a minute long little video just talking about the background and how the Cambridge Pohoro sister city was set up. So we've done a version in English that'll have Japanese subtitles and a Japanese version that'll have English subtitles.  So not only sharing that through the embassy, but also through our own social media, again, helping, hopefully, our community to understand more about that relationship. So yeah, good stuff at the moment. Yeah, good.",
