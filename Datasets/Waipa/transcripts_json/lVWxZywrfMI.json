I just wonder whether we can help fund the building works, the 50,000 loan funded so that it's not too much of an impact on us in  in this year and look, that's down to Ken and the team, I suppose, how we fund it, but and then supporting their operating costs to their full whatever it was, 60 odd thousand. If there's not enough money in the arbitrage funds, then it's one project that would need to go on to the rates as far as I could see.",

So, you know, their expertise lies in what they do, not in building a building. So anything that we can do to help,  I thought her comment was very valid as well, that this particular building, whatever the future holds, it sits on council land and will be able to use, you know, hopefully for their purposes for a very long time. But if that was not to be the case, then it could always be used for something else. So us investing in this building for me is, yeah, I fully support it. Thank you. Graeme then Roger.",

Because they do have some paid employees. Does anyone know if they've qualified for that, the big trigger for that or the qualification criteria, and the main being that you've had a 30% decline in your income?  Has anyone got any knowledge of whether they've got that? Because the only thing I was going to say, so one component of the submission is looking for some support for ongoing annual operation costs. And what I was going to say is that probably 10 to 14 days ago, the government announced a small business cash flow loan scheme.  We're essentially to support ongoing operating costs for businesses affected by COVID. Well, businesses, community organisations, etc. affected by COVID. You could actually get a loan from the government, the IRD administers the scheme. Quite clearly, it's a loan that needs to be repaid back. But if repaid in the first year, it's absolutely interest free.  So it allows you to buy some time, and I believe the maximum length of the loan was four years. If you go beyond the year without repaying, then it carries an interest rate of 3%, so obviously an attractive interest rate. But I do just wonder if the Cambridge Community House has explored that possibility. The key criteria for qualifying for that loan is if you qualified for the wage subsidy, you pretty much qualify for that loan.  So, um, yeah, there might be something just so in fact, it is a bit regrettable that I didn't think about that this morning when they were actually young when they're actually on the screen, so my apologies for that, but it might be something worth just going back to them on as well.",

So, yeah, so I'm just mindful, like, in relation to this discussion, in relation to the discussion on the church just before, if we're seeing those arbitrage funds as a resource\u2014 and it's quite natural that we would, because, you know, they don't have the rating implications\u2014 I think the only thing to really consider there is, is that going to compromise our recovery efforts, because quite clearly we're dealing with a limited bucket of funds.",

Is that what you're suggesting by funding by loan? So we're not lending money?  Yes, yeah, we're not lending money to the entity, but we're borrowing it and granting it. Yes. So, look, that is a possibility, Your Worship, and in fact, I guess a mechanism to avoid that hitting rates is that we do that, we borrow the $50,000, we make that grant to the entity, and then in terms of any servicing costs for that $50,000 loan, we actually fund that, potentially, by arbitrage funds.  and then there would be no impact on the ratepayer, and obviously that's far less of a direct hit on the arbitrage funds, which, as I said before, could potentially compromise our recovery efforts. \u2014 Liz, you had your hand up there, or did Jim want\u2014 Jim, you're muted.",

And I wonder whether or not  we could look to those groups to fulfill some of that community development role.

In terms of the notes that we've identified as part of the staff comments in our recommendation is regarding it being a public road and that is something that there is a process and Brian can definitely talk to that about changing that.  If we were to put a gate up similar to something that's happened at Waipukee Park, there would need to be funding associated with that because there is no funding set aside for a security gate. So I think those are the things. There's also the submitter that we heard yesterday is actually their notes are included under the community services section of the report. So I think there's about three of them as well. Okay, thank you Sally.",

Well, it's now the ownership has changed, but and certainly that first meeting that Ellen and I were at where there was definitely discussion about what could be done to improve the  the reserve area for want of a better description. But in terms of the road access, and I agree with your comments that the public have right of access over an unformed paper road, but that doesn't mean that they should have vehicle access. So my understanding, as long as people can walk, there's no obligation to have a paper road  open for vehicle access, it's just got to be open for the public to use. So, I'm just wondering whether we're 100% correct in the sort of reasoning behind our recommendation there that the public has  right of enjoyment over that paper road. They certainly can walk on it and et cetera, but I don't know whether we have got a problem with actually putting a gate to stop vehicle access and whether it's a, whether the cost of maintaining that reserve could be offset against the damage that's done by these hoons getting up there in their cars.",

So, there's only, I think, about 200 metres beyond that, which is unformed and it's fenced into the paddocks of the adjacent farm. So, the issue is not arising from the unformed piece of road, it's arising from the formed piece of road.  And so we would need to be putting a security gate down at the intersection with Mangakawa Road to actually close the formed road off from the public after hours. So that's the issue. And we probably still need to allow a pedestrian gateway at that point.  so that people could still, you know, if they wanted to see a sunrise or a sunset or something like that, and the gate had closed, that they could still access the park.",

Now, particularly in Rolleston Street, and it's not only that I live in Rolleston Street, I actually know that this to be the truth of what they're all saying. And we have these great big trucks rattling down our street. And I think I actually discussed it with some of our staff to say, it's really not on. The street isn't built for those huge, great big trucks. And what the heck are they doing?  coming along our street when the bypass is a long golf road and off into highway whatever to go either north or south wherever they're coming from but then I was told well their GPS tells them to do that and you just think for God's sake  Can we not do something about changing this silly GPS? Is it controlling the safety? Now, we, in particular, in Rolleston Street, there are a lot of families. There's a lot of young children in homes along that street. And I would say probably now, particularly down the southern end where I live, there's lots of kids. And, you know, we're going to take, well, before shutdown happened,  we had talked to the police about the safety down there. I've also asked the council to make that crossing of, oh gosh, what's the main highway that goes east to west along there past the Kihiki school, but where it joins that road to make them compulsory stops because we've just had another smash the other day. And  So I feel very strongly about this. Every day we think something's gonna happen here. And when you get a car, a car parked on one side of the road and on the other side of the road, then you have this great big truck. And I mean big, I mean those big logging trucks. So why do they have to put up with that? And it just seems like,  we get fobbed off, but the police have said to us, well, take, give us your petition, and the whole, we've got that all organized when we're allowed to do it, and they'll come out and they'll take photos and they'll, you know, but what can they, you see, then they say, but what law are they breaking by doing that, you know?  And it just seems like it's an extremely... And why the heck are the trucks coming off the route that's there for them, which has the roading built for those big trucks? What are they doing coming down our side streets?

The complaints in the past that council has received was that the  the heavy traffic was on Flat Road leading into Rolleston Street. And I think the submission says change the intersection of Golf Road and Flat Road to prevent trucks going through that way. So, we have had these complaints in the past and we put out traffic counters. I think it was just last year on Flat Road and the year before. And in both of those counts, we found very little  well, those statistics that were quoted there, 95 per cent car traffic and 5 per cent with the small trucks like the rubbish truck. But I hear you saying that this is actually further along Rolleston Street and on the southern end of Rolleston Street. And to my knowledge, that's the first time that I've heard that the problem is at that southern end and we've not put traffic counters out at that end. So, I can certainly arrange for some special counts  on Roleston Street, say in the middle of Roleston and at the southern end. And so we can gather some data and just see what the issue is or how big this issue is. And like you say, it could well be trucks who are following their GPS off Whitmore Street, down Roleston Street, heading towards State Highway 3, which is a view that I haven't heard before. So we can follow that up. And if that evidence is showing that, yes, it is a significant problem, we'll look for ways to address that.",

    "text": "All right. That's great news. More great news. We've got this table on the screen there, starting at point number 10.3.  going all the way down, all the way down, all the way down. The first one you're suggesting there'd be a change is 33.1. Let me just, I'm flicking through mine, just checking that that'd be right, yeah. Councillor, so this was the Good Ex Road matter. Council agrees to work with the affected parties concerned to find a practical solution to the issues raised. So that's great, and that was the same for 34.1.  and then 35.1 is all good to go as well. So that moves us into the community services section. So, in this topic, we start on page 30 of our submissions with point number 19.99. This is a submission by the Timothy Community Board.  alerting council to the potential to develop long-term car parking for business staff on Churchill Street, which is something that I've raised quite regularly. And of course, there's a response there in terms of the staff response and then a recommendation. Have I got any discussion to be had on that point? Now, everybody's quite comfortable with the response that staff have drafted. Great.  Awesome. So move on to 19.6. Again, the community board proposed or recommends the use of bollards or strategic planting on council parks to prevent vehicles from going on. There's obviously a response around the ongoing maintenance costs for those. And the recommendation is that we just note the request and concerns about Selwyn Park in particular.  This is one that is raised quite frequently, and I guess from a personal perspective, I've never really seen any real damage or safety issue out there as a result of cars being on that park, but I'm not there all the time. So if we're comfortable with that response, Andrew?",

There was some discussion about this yesterday, I believe. So we've got a staff response there and the recommendation is that we just note their requests. Are we comfortable with those? Yep.  Yep. Excellent. Give that a tick. And another one from the community board, suggesting that the library, the new library in Cambridge, be given the highest priority. Obviously, it currently sits in years nine and 10 of the current LTP. And the staff comments are to that effect and a recommendation alerting them to that. No further, no change to that?",

Next one is Cambridge Community Board's request for a destination playground. Obviously the staff response highlights the business cases to be considered as part of the LTP programme, but there's no current site yet identified. That there's an open spaces plan and chain, and obviously the community boards will be consulted. So I think that's a pretty thorough response.

Again, funding has been sought relating to, excuse me, funding for historic heritage assessments. So there's an agreement there that the assessments to identify heritage values  is important, obviously, and that there's a requirement there or allocation in the annual plan as it is. So we just note those submissions. We're happy with that. Yes, everybody's looking very quiet. 21.4, community services and facilities, land wars, site interpretation of facilities and heritage showcase sites. Staff comment there and a recommendation that we just note their requests.  No comment there from anybody. Great. Comfortable with that one. And onto the Federated Farmers submission at 22.2, specifically connected to the National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity. Comments note that the council made a similar comment to in their submissions and mostly concerned about costs and where they'd fall. So it's good to see there's some  alignment there from my perspective. So those are the comments and there's a recommendation that we acknowledge the submission and that no further action is required. We're comfortable with that. Excellent.

So Kiki Polo, Cambridge Polo are examples of that in terms of those existing mowing subsidies. Those existing mowing subsidies are also within wider parks as well that other people can use, whereas in terms of my understanding with this site, it is very much leased completely to this site.

    "text": "It's only a small change in the recommendation on 39.3, rather than saying on the last bit of it, it says, and propose to council for appointment as appropriate. I think Roger suggested we say propose to council  for consideration as appointment. That's appropriate. Is that right, Roger? To council for consideration. Yeah, just remove the word appointment to consideration. Yeah. That being the only change, I don't think we don't need to see the table. No, I don't think so with this one. We'll just soldier on into red literary. So we're now on page 37.7.5, submission 7.5.  These next two obviously relate to licensing matters. Pretty self-explanatory what they're seeking. And then the response, got the staff comment there. And then the council recommended response. It's pretty, we've got no wiggle room there as far as I read it. Andrew's nodding his head. We all seem happy with that. We better be, because we've got nothing else we can do there.  Okay, great. Moving on then to the next one. Again, there's little we can do there, unfortunately, for this person other than to thank them. Are we comfortable with that, the way that that is worded? Yeah, excellent, fantastic. Moving on to page 38, point number 20.7.  Cambridge Community Board supports the community priority areas in the 2019 Town Concept Plan refresh. So that's nice, we've said thank you. That's about the strength of that one, so I'm assuming we're feeling all comfortable with that. Yep, great. Then on to 27.2, there's a plea from a submitter to not allow telecommunication companies to set up more cell phone towers and 5G technology.  Obviously, this is a very topical subject, but we're all aware of the limitations that exist in this space in terms of whose responsibility this is and the national environmental standards that are currently in place. So there's a staff comment there and a recommendation. Are we comfortable with that or are there any suggested changes? No, we're all good. Excellent. I have to confess,  I had to Google agenda 21 to understand what it was and I now see that. So there's a staff response there and a recommendation, which I think is entirely appropriate in the circumstances. We're in support and respect of that matter. Yep, excellent. Over the page, page 39, Cambridge Community Board has asked whether there is a need to  there was possibility that we could bring forward the CBD projects in order to create jobs and keep local businesses going. Obviously, there's a response there and our recommendation accepting that submission and noting their requests. No discussion on that? I take it. Fantastic. Thank you. Moving to 22.3. There is a request  in the future for consultation information on LTPs and annual plans to have more detailed itemised tables of benchmark properties as rating examples. I kind of think that is a helpful thing to have too, so I kind of quite like that idea. But there's the staff response and a recommendation and no particular commitment to other than to say that better information for consultation is noted. We're comfortable with that.  Yep. Okay. In lieu of anybody waving hands at me, I'm assuming you're comfortable with it. Moving on then to 22.7. Request that the up and coming review of the LTP enables us to actually contemplate undertaking some of the Productivity Commissioner's findings.  There's a response there set up by staff and a recommendation asking the submitter to participate in the community engagement process. I think that's an appropriate response in the circumstances. Great. And then 22.8. My eyes are going a bit wonky. That future community consultation encourages participants to think about costs and how they would be prepared to pay for proposed services.  a good response by staff and a recommendation, I'm comfortable with that. Yep, excellent. And then the last one in that section there is a request by the submitter for us to concern ourselves only with the main issue of infrastructure. And obviously there's a well-worded response by staff or comment by staff. And then our recommendation there is  as noted below that, and I presume we're all happy with that as well. Yes, excellent. Same. Turn the page. So I don't think there were any changes in that lot. So we can move straight on to the next one, which is the policy section. Now, an interesting, so we're on page 41.  an interesting observation in terms of smoke-free policies by Submitter 2.1 and a very logical and well-worded response by staff there and our recommendation. Any discussion there or comments to be made by anybody?  And I take it. Excellent. Well, it looks like smoke, non-smoking in cars is coming in.",

And yeah, so there's nothing further we can add to that one really, is there? Right now? No.  So these were the fleshed out things that they were asking for, you see, and the second one was to be acknowledged as the important link between the local community with police, civil defense, and other agencies. And then the third one was to continue to receive Waip\u0101 Council updates and media releases. So those were the three of the things they were seeking. So I don't have any problems with any of those, but does anybody else have,  they wish to raise in respect of any of those three submissions, all in respect of the Cambridge Neighbourhood Support Group. Phil, are you just waving at me or what? No, you know. Hi. Yeah. No, nothing there. So the one outstanding then in respect of the Cambridge Neighbourhood Support then is the 23.3, which doesn't appear in this section.  and it was the query over funding that we currently provide them and where they're seeking an increase or not. And we haven't got any clarity on that, unfortunately. So- Yeah. I guess that, I mean, well, that's something that we can probably address it briefly anyway, in terms of our meeting on the 9th in any event, because it is a financial matter. So it makes sense for it to be dealt with anyway. So as long as we have that information by then, I'm sure we'll-  we'll be able to resolve that submission. Excellent. So no changes to community relations. That's more change to policy. And I think that's us done. Look at us. Is that everything, Graham?",
