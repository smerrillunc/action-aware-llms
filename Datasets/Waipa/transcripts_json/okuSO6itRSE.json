    "text": " Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Yes, the purpose of this report is to seek adoption of the draft annual plan and that consultation document for public consultation. That consultation period would be from 18th of March, so that's this Friday, out until the 20th of April, so just over one month.  And to provide a bit more context of how we got to this point, you'll recall that we came to elected members last year, where we looked to agree an approach to preparing this annual plan. And in that, we recognised that we'd just gone through that rigorous process of approving a long-term plan just a few months prior, and we didn't really want to stray too far from what we had put all the work into agreeing and approving in that.  So with that in mind, when we went out to the organisation, the managers and the budget holders, we asked them to review their budgets, but not look to put any new projects in to the annual plan that weren't already there in the long term plan.  So over the next few months, the budget holders and managers did do that. And then we came back again to elected members in the new year, in this year, 2022, with a preliminary annual plan. And that landed really closely with year two of the long-term plan. There wasn't very much different at all. And with that, we had that initial recommendation where we would just engage with the community, because there was nothing significantly different from the LTP.  From there, we continued to refine budgets. We were applying all the advice we got from our usual financial advisors in terms of interest rates, inflation rates, the wider economic environment, and continuing to look at our own internal budgets. A few things that emerged after that, and you'll be familiar with those, with the Waka Kotahi funding reduction. So we didn't get that share of funding for our urban mobility program.  There was the issue with recycling contamination and then the contract issue with that. And then there was the Ngaroto-Pirongia TA cycleway delays. So just not progressing as fast because we didn't get those landowner agreements underway as fast as anticipated.  We've also spoken about the general inflationary pressures that we've all been experiencing, especially over the last couple of months, and those tend to become more evident. However, we've talked with EMs about how some of those cost pressures have been managed, and we've presented that updated annual plan again since all that. And the follow-up to that was that now we recommended that we would consult, mostly to get the community's feedback on those three main issues.  and just starting to signal some of the inflationary pressures, not really asking a question, but just highlighting it and things like the Mears Forward, just so that it's getting out there in the community. We understand it's happening. And if we need to continue that conversation, it's out there being started.  We also recognize we hadn't, over the last sort of eight, nine months, hadn't really had an opportunity to connect with our community in a very robust way. Just with COVID, we haven't been able to get there. So we thought it was a good opportunity to go to a full consultation and generate that consultation document that you've got attached to this report.  Yeah, so that's where we're at. Those issues are covered off in the consultation document. I will hand over to Hannah shortly to speak a bit more about that consultation period or that phase. But first, I just want to cover off the Development Contributions Policy, which is appended as Attachment 3 to the report.  In there, it's just presenting some minor wording changes to align the DC policy with the LGA in terms of how things are assessed. And it's also got that updated fee schedule that reflect actual costs and the latest estimated costs. So the legal advice with that DC policy is we don't need to consult on it.  So it's not actually in the consultation document. However, we have had that targeted stakeholder engagement with the development community, and we'll package up the feedback we get from that, which is still coming in, alongside the feedback we get through this consultation period over the next month, and bring it back to you together. So with that, I will just check, have we got Hannah here to potentially speak a little more around the consultation  period?",

Within that, we're doing all the normal rounds that we would have advertising, printed copies of the consultation document at our counters and libraries, information all on the website, submission form. Something we're doing a bit different this year is we're doing the webinar series.  As Haven alluded to, it's been more challenging to connect with our communities face to face due to COVID protocols. So we have brought in this webinar series so that we can make sure our community has a voice across the annual plan and be able to connect with you, our councillors. So we have that series that will run right across the district, including  one specifically for business and also for the rural and farming sector as well. So far, that's actually had quite good feedback along on that idea. So we're quite excited about that one. So on top of that, we have looked into public and community meetings, however, due to COVID protocols.  Very few public meetings are being held, and if they are, not a lot of them would like external visitors. So there is just a couple of those that we will be attending, but we're happy to hear from the public if they have any other ones for you to attend. On top of that, we'll be utilizing our social channels. We've created some collateral, which includes the annual plan in a nutshell, just to give people a nice and quick in-depth look at how an annual plan comes around.  and also a breakdown of what you get per $100 of your rates as an infographic, and that is across the rural community, lifestylers and urban as well. And of course, with some of the issues that have been raised in the consultation document, we are looking at further education around those, especially around recycling and the contamination issues that we've been having with that.",

I found that really helpful, because I do think that a lot of our discussions at council tend to suppose that you are  a resident living in an urban dwelling. And very often, if you are not in that sort of stereotypical arrangement, our discussions tend to miss how these things affect you.

I also am looking on the page about let's talk rates and the first column at the bottom it talks about growth cell developments in two places in that paragraph  And really, I do think that's council speak for new developments, you know, or new subdivisions or something.

Firstly, there's late Ngaroto,  in the first dark blue box doesn't have a macron on it. But the last paragraph above the urban mobility is a very long sentence. That whole paragraph is one sentence.

And we rely upon the communication by the consultation document that's out there.  And the question I raised was how many of our material variances actually should be in there. The three that we've asked for consultation on, to my mind, are the ones we do want feedback on those, but they're  quite nice in inverted commas variations. You know, I mean, it's easy to see and explain. And when we talk about the others that are in the document, the additional honorarium, strategic relationships, increase in salaries, those kinds of things I would have thought are material and therefore some mentioned in the consultation document perhaps would be advisable.

So, look, if you look at the actual annual plan document, the 84-page annual plan document for each of our groups of activities, you know, there is detailed financial information.  and anything that is significant there in terms of a variance between year two of the LTP and the annual plan for that very same year, there is an explanation for those things. So that document, the draft and the plan document that you've got to sign off today is obviously going to be widely available to the public. They will have the explanations for any significant variance at all.  But, yeah, returning to the purpose of the consultation document, I guess the purpose of the consultation document, and bearing in mind that it is a four-page document rather than an 84-page document, the purpose of that is to, at a very high level, reassure the public that things are on track.  in regard to the global numbers in terms of the headline number on rates. We in the LTP said that our average rates increase would be 4.4 percent. The consultation document is saying that the average for the annual plan will be 4.3 percent.  So at that very high level, we're giving the reassurance that we're on track there. And then in that fourth page of the consultation document, I guess what we're doing is we're picking out three projects that we particularly think the public should know about just due to the significant  public interest in those particular items, or the nature of the change, and, you know, essentially we're seeking feedback on those things. So, yeah, so look, I mean, we could put a whole lot of explanations for significant  appearances in the consultation document, but I'd suggest that's not the intent of the legislation. The legislation is very much talking about that consultation document picking up on items of significant interest to the public and using that document to shape the feedback that we receive on those matters of material interest to the public.",

So, yeah, that's where, but I'm not sure on the overhead split and the direct costs to  to the councillors. But certainly, I'd agree with Susan that, look, there's nothing hidden in the plan. But just to list the variances in our consultation document has, I suppose, the possibility of making it a really negative document in terms of people just looking for those changes and making submissions on that rather than the real feedback that we want.  But it's all there in the document, and I know it's 84 pages, but that's not a huge document for people to look through if they've got a real interest, and then they can find out exactly what's going on, rather than a summarized version that's likely to hit the papers with no detailed, I suppose, investigation or thought about what the reasons are.

Then we'd bring back an updated annual plan to you at SP, or Strategic Planning and Policy Committee, in early June.

A lot of that, I think, is in relation to some of our structuring changes in terms of where those community advisors, et cetera, sit.  and what that has led to is a shift of overheads from one activity area to another. And I guess that's what I was referring to when I said we will use that editorial license. Just to be a bit more specific about that, this is not a huge blowout of overheads. It is a shift of overheads and there's a compensating saving in another activity's overheads. So yeah, we'll work through that over the next couple of days and fine-tune those explanations.",

So, yeah, so look, let's bear in mind, I think, that given where we're at,  in the timeframes, that disclosure may need to stay the same, but certainly this could be changed between now and June if, for whatever reason, we have to reinstate that grant. I mean, I would be very surprised if we had sort of randomly just taken that grant out. I'm sure there is a good reason for removing that. If it turns out that that reason isn't appropriate, it can be reinstated in June.",

So on the basis that we extend that little bit of editorial license, so to speak, does that address everybody's concerns? I'm comfortable with it. Claire, you're nodding. Roger seems reasonably comfortable. Most people are nodding. Any other questions for Haven, Kirsty, or Ken, or Hannah, in respect of any of these documents?  and there are no further things to add from staff on them. That being the case, we'll turn our minds then to the series of recommendations we have there appearing on page 15 of our agenda. Obviously the first one's to receive the report, second one's to approve the draft annual plan for consultation, the third one is to approve the annual plan consultation document, the fourth one is to receive the extracts from the draft amended  development contribution policy, which was addressed by Haven earlier and clarified a little by Tony. Then we delegate the authority to the deputy CE to be slightly poetic in terms of making any small editorial amendments as we've raised today. And then to finally approve the public consultation period from 8th of March to 20th of April and sitting down hearings for submissions on the 3rd and 4th of May. So I have those recommendations from A to F.  Ken, you've got your hand up. You're waving frantically at me. What have I done?",
