    "text": "Lovely. Thank you. Through the chairs.  Further to the report, I just was sort of reflecting on a couple of things. One of them was in doing our flood hazard mapping and discussion with the team in terms of sort of how things were going. A lot of the conversations with people who were receiving the letter indicating that their dwelling would be impacted in a 100-year storm event,  sort of that there's a level of disbelief. You know, people think, no, you know, I've never seen rainfall like that. I've never seen flooding in my area. And so, you know, it's that awareness, I guess, in terms of the intensity of rainfall events, you know, that we're anticipating occurring and that our community aren't, I guess, aware of these sorts of impacts maybe ahead of us.  And the other thing thinking about is, had an opportunity to have a discussion with KPMG in the last week or two, sort of talking about this, this deep dive. And they brought in a climate change chap talking from his international experience, that from a local authority perspective, that we're very good at finding and identifying the physical risks. And a lot of these have been sort of talked about both in the  sort of in this paper, as well as as we work through our environment strategy, but that for us as an organization, have we really turned our minds to our transition risks? You know, as our  You know, as a council, we're expected to be planning for this future and, you know, take on that role of leader, custodian, kaitiaki on behalf of our communities. But, you know, have we sort of thought about what are the right structures and systems and policy settings in terms of understanding the risks associated by that future?  you know, as the local economy may change, you know, are we well prepared and have thought about the response that we have as an organisation. So, you know, this transformation, you know, New Zealand is not alone across the globe, you know, this transition to a low emissions economy.  you know we've got to be able to respond in a transparent and quite deliberate manner you know and as I say in some instances our community may not be ready to accept or understand some of those necessary actions.  And then equally into the future, we're starting to see that legal action is starting to be considered. If we don't support the work towards or if our responses are slow around decarbonisation, exposure to insurance risk,  Out of interest at the moment, there is a group who are taking a judicial review of the National Land Transport Plan and program that was adopted by the Waka Kotahi on the basis that that hasn't taken enough recognition and cognizance of the commitment to climate change and the decarbonization of transport.  So as I say, it's those sorts of aspects that kind of turning our minds to are things that are ongoing. However, with respect to where we find ourselves at the moment, with respect to the mitigations that we are undertaking as staff, I've given an outline in terms of where we are at that.  I note that separate, you know, we have got a report coming later this afternoon from the carbon monitoring and reduction team. And I really want to recognize the work of the team and the staff who have put up their hands to be a part of those work groups. You know, to me, that's tremendous that we've got such passionate people within our team who are willing to come up with some innovative ideas and help support the work needed to address climate change through reducing our emissions.  Our food waste feasibility, that work is still going, although of course we'll be subject to the announcement yesterday from the Minister around making a more consistent recycling collection across the country and consistent how we do that, the old tops on, tops off, the products that we do collect, as well as considering food waste.  We'll have to look at that piece of work where it's at and its cycle as to whether, how it sits against that, as well as preparing a submission on that consultation document before 8th of May is when that one closes. And I started with our flood hazard viewer and of course that work is now largely completed. The flood hazard viewer is available on our website and our letters have gone out to people impacted by those significant events.  But I don't know whether it's worth taking a break and sort of on that component or if there are any questions in that report or flow through to the Three Waters reform. I wonder, Dawn, if we could just move the climate change impacts report by then going to the appendix and looking at the current settings as we have them for top risk 10.",

And it was more in terms of what was happening with the Three Waters reform, but I also see it in the climate change where, as you say, technically we  we can predict that these flood events are likely to happen or at some point and people's houses are going to go under and nobody actually believes it. So the pressure comes on politically then to, I suppose,  was going to say ignore it, but to try and soften what mitigation measures we need to take to actually protect people now and into the future. And it might be 100 years out, but it could be next week. And as they found out in  in Australia, in New South Wales and Queensland just recently. So look, I think it is a real risk that from a professional or technical perspective, we've got Taitura adopting one stance and the, if you like, the political arm of the organisation  which is where the buck stops if we make the wrong decisions. There's a differing, as I say, well, yeah, there's differing opinions, I suppose, but there's also who is actually responsible if things start to go wrong, and it's council. And the feedback we're getting from the community is that it's,  It's an unlikely risk, and therefore you can ignore it. And we certainly, with the information we've got, don't believe that. So I think there's a real risk that there is going to be this divergence of opinion until the balloon goes up.

And continually rebuilding in the same location is not logical as they found down the West Coast. So at what point you start moving towns or moving parts of towns away from those risky areas. And the earlier we start, the less expensive it's gonna be.  So it's that forward planning and making sure we don't make the situation any worse. But what are we going to do for the people that have invested possibly there?  well, the vast majority of their economic wellbeing in a place that we've all of a sudden now collectively see it as a high-risk area and had significant impact on the value of their property.

And in some cases, we've got situations where that's not the case.  And so our programme of work is now being developed in terms of what are those immediate ones that we need to do upgrading work to achieve that one and two year and then rerun the model in terms of well does that diminish the amount of flooding such that the property may still be inundated but not the dwelling.  So we certainly have subsequent work. We've talked previously in terms of whether our level of service is about right, and certainly we had feedback that that level of service, the one and two year protection for our developed urban areas was appropriate. So now it's making sure we all, as I say, all areas meet that, and then relooking at our models subsequently.",

So my question is like, given that you are embarking on that, is there any process where once you've completed it, that you're going to possibly review those flood hazard settings for those properties that we're aware of?

I guess the only other component of it is that over time, we're using equally the latest rainfall data, and will that start to alter over time, that our storm events, the intensity becomes even greater over time so that we mitigate some risk, but we've got increased risk of just that level of inundation.  And certainly what we saw in Australia recently, for me, it was the conversations or the interviews with people that just talked about the absolutely torrential downpour and the duration of it. But yeah, in terms of re-looking based on the data that we have, we will certainly do it. But yeah, as I say, it's not necessarily an automatic uplift, I don't think.  Oh no, but it's really reassuring to hear that not only are you, you know, reviewing what's on the ground and why par with that infrastructure, but there's sort of, you know, a living document or a moving, you know, like you're also looking at the models that are being used to predict rainfall and you're updating those all the time as well.",

We're going to come back to that later. And, you know, the food waste you said, and you've completed the flood hazard stuff, but you're going to monitor. It strikes me that then there might well be a re-characterization of actually what the risk is.  I think it would be fair to say so that you know it's somewhere, and we've added the fifth mitigation obviously, which is the internal audit work. It seems to me that the nature of the risk changes because it's really, we don't understand or we haven't prepared, but then it must, I think the risk moves to something, I haven't quite gotten my head what that is, but I think it's a different stage Dawn.",

But that was extended through to June post-COVID once the DIA understood the implications from particularly the lockdown and last August.

We know we've been constrained by the government requirements in terms of financial prudence limits. And so in many cases, it really is difficult for councils to spend the quantum of money required and manage growth and live within the government's restrictions and deliver top quality waters infrastructure. We've managed to do it, but  My fear is that in terms of reputational risk, bringing the public up to speed with the whole big picture in terms of the statutory constraints under which we operate and the way in which we've managed our waters infrastructure, it's going to be a really, really tough ask and require a lot of dedicated resource. And I guess  a preferred response would be to try and engage with Department of Internal Affairs and the Minister as they craft their public relations campaign on this thing so that the public get a genuinely fair indication of how the picture stands for territorial authorities across New Zealand.",

So it makes me wonder whether indeed  as much as we've got these mitigations in place and that first line dawn is a very big one, whether in fact the residual setting is indeed high, it might be our target, but I'm struggling to understand. Well, I suppose we've got a current assessment of very high at the moment. I wonder whether that's even the right colour. But anyway, it's not the biggest problem we've got today.

I just wonder if there is a way to capture sensitively the issues around  a resetting by the crown of the program, including the communications.

I really picked up your concerns about water staff and I was a bit concerned to see that you think you may have lost some staff because they don't feel like they're recognising the risk that's in the sector and finding, you know, safer havens, I guess.  And I understood that the DIA was sort of working directly with staff or providing a lot of support and, you know, the water's employment area so that we weren't going to get this effect. And I just don't have confidence that that's, you know, working effectively. And so, you know, like this was flagged really early on about how a short of  specialist roles, you know, we had, and also the need for more new people coming through to train them up and things like that. And yet, it just looks like all of those outcomes that we could foresee were going to happen, that was so negative. And there's a real risk that they're actually going to materialize.

But I'm not certain at this stage there's anything else that we would want to add, or that you're necessarily requesting we add. And I guess finally,  Even though we've got these mitigations, I do suspect at this point it won't get us past very high in terms of our current risk assessment.

As far as the management report is concerned, I know your agenda is very full, and so I'll take the report as read. It won't go into detail. It is a very detailed report, as we did not issue an interim management report last year, but only this one. So there's a lot of recommendations in this one very detailed report.  On your pages 130 and 131, we set out our key messages from last year's audit. Also, a bit more detailed than I did in the past. That's probably Liz's influence shining through.  We have also raised some new recommendations on pages 132 and 133 of your agenda. Most of these key recommendations relate to controls, where we recommend best or good practice and council then have to take into account cost benefit.  of what we are recommending. So some of the council's responses are more reactive controls that are in place, while we see best practice to be more preventative controls. Then it's also good to see the continuous improvement of asset data, although this has led to some issues similar to what we've seen at other councils as well, as data  information becomes, you know, increases, you just find more assets or find there were some issues in the past. And so I'm not very much surprised with that. But it is something we just raised in the report. On page 134, we give a summary of previous recommendations.  which will be discussed in the next agenda item. So I'm not going into detail, but it's good to see that we were able to clear nine of previously raised recommendations. And that's my story.",

It is what's the risk to WIPA  and how is that addressed by management. So we'll have that conversation with Ken.

I think there's, on a quick count, there's about three or four of them that we're kind of thinking we have pretty much addressed.  and perhaps the case in point is that first one, the EPO system update. Because we're kind of struggling a little bit when we read Audit's update in that second column, the February 2022 update,  where we're at almost is an indication that we've pretty much solved the issue. We've come a long way. We've actually also had KPMG in their report, which was on the agenda as an earlier item,  saying that, you know, they were looking at procurement and contract management, and they've indicated, look, you know, EPOs are up and running and you're utilizing them fully.

Are there any other? I think we've had a fair crack at this, so I'm going to suggest Ken really has summed it up. Leon, I think I can leave it that we'll move on. You don't have any comment you need to make at this point?  Thank you. No comment from me. Let's look at the resolution, which is that we receive the Landers report. Again, thank you, Linda. It's important that we do keep ourselves over this and we're looking forward to the report and indeed.  Let's acknowledge, as we go to this resolution, exactly the point that, indeed, from singing from the same song sheet, we have cleared nine. So that's well done, Leon and Ken, appreciate that, and Yolanda, the work that your team would have put in to have got us there. So let's acknowledge that, as well as also recognise we're agreeing to a programme to address the rest in the ways that we've talked about. So look, I'll move from the chair that we receive Yolanda's report. Do I have a seconder, please? Thank you, Roger.  I'll put the motion. All those in favour, please raise their hands. Say aye. Those against. It's carried. Thank you for that.  Right, into the audit plan. Leon, before you speak, Ken, Leolanda, is there anything you'd like to say in context before we get going? Thank you, Chi.",

So we just want to highlight that there would be no monthly reporting in July. That is our standard practice. On the 16th of August, we are planning a workshop with the Finance and Corporate Committee to have a look at the draft annual report.  and then bring it to this committee on the 26th of September for recommendation for formal adoption to council the day after that, the 27th of September. Noting that is tight, but this is the only feasible time that we can secure resources from Leon's team and make the deadline before the October elections as is our plan.",

And the one is council being able to deliver, not because they could deliver us, but purely because the timeframes are so tight, any slip up will cause us issues. And the second is causes the continuing impact of COVID-19 auditing offsite remotely and auditor shortage.  in Australia and New Zealand. And so at this stage, we've confirmed these dates. But I have to tell you that it is at risk. And if my team gets pulled, there's no way we're going to keep to this. Now, you know me by now that I'm a straight talker, and I don't sugarcoat things. And that is why I'm telling you straight up.  Those are the two risks I see to the timelines. The rest of my report is very similar to the past, the areas of audit focus.

I get that the issues don't look that much different to what we've seen in the past. Revaluation, capital works program, those sorts of things, you know, management, override of controls. It's a relatively standard thing. Having said that, standard things can crip us up.  Is there any chance that the best way that you can do it, that if we're going to have this catch up over internal controls, that by the June meeting we've got some sense that things like revaluations or fair value assessments aren't going to trip us up?  or indeed any of those other issues.

Yolanda can speak probably more specifically to the timing, but look, we realise that that work needs to be done very quickly,  and forwarded through to audit so that they can draw the relevant conclusion. Because it's already a very tight timeframe. If we have to do unexpected revaluations, that will, of course, make that pretty complicated.
