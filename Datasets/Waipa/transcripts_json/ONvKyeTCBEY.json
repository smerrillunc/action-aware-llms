    "text": "I will try to... I'm worried that it's quite long, so I'll try and go reasonably speedy. Yes, everybody should have read it by now. And any questions, just sing out as we go through. So, the background there, we can probably skip through to slide number five, I think. Karen?  So the background is that we won the Keep, the most beautiful large town in the Keep New Zealand beautiful wards last October.  and it's for the year 2019 and in 2020 there'll be new winners announced so we have it until until October 2019 and we'll be applying again for status so hopefully we get it for another year or two. Been talking to council and roading and comms team about getting some signage up around town to celebrate this and it's just taking a little while to get positions that we can use  And in the interim, I did take photos of a bunch of our Welcome to Cambridge signs to also show you and just draw attention to and start a conversation about those. That's the second part of this presentation. So with the Keep New Zealand Beautiful signs, we've got two locations that we permitted to use. One of them has changed since this slide was sent out. And you would have seen what Julie has sent through. So the picture we're looking at there is coming in from the Avanti Drome End.  And on the right-hand side, you've got a welcome to Cambridge sign tucked into the trees there. Originally, we were allowed to repurpose that sign or put a sign down below, which is the mock-up of the next slide. But thank you. We have now been given permission to use the left-hand side of the road. So if we scoot back one. Sorry, Kieran.  We can now use the left-hand side of the road. And the reason I asked for that is because when you're driving into Cambridge, the right-hand side gets lost. Your eye's not naturally drawn to it. You're driving at 50 k's an hour, and it just doesn't get that well seen. So we have got permission to use the left-hand side. And the sign is 2.4 by 1.2, so it's the same size as what you're seeing there with that Welcome to Cambridge sign. If we go to the next slide,  This is a mock-up of what the sign could look like. So this has been done for free by CAS Designs, and it's in keeping with the Keep New Zealand Beautiful branding guidelines as well. But it's by no means a firm and fast vinyl design, so that's up for feedback as well. What I'm really asking from the community board today is would they support and be okay with these signs going, and any feedback around the design of them?  So if we scoot to the next one, this is coming in from the expressway, Victoria Road. So you've got the Hautapu Rugby Clubs on the left. And again, we were allowed to either repurpose the first sign you see there, the blue sign, or put the sign with the red markers. So if we go to the next sign, I think, sorry, PowerPoint, thank you. It's just also pointing out the state of that first sign. That's probably one of our worst around town. Next slide.  So that is just a bit of a mock-up of its positioning. It'll be slightly behind that tree that you can see there, but that's roughly what would be 50 meters down the road from that current sign. Go to the next one. So that's a slightly more close-up.  On this one here, you can see the 2019 and then the word winner. We have to have the year on the sign as part of the requirements. The reason it's sort of positioned a bit like that is that we would hope to win it in 2020 and we just repurpose it and take out the winner and put in 2020 in that space.  Go to the next slide, thank you. So who pays for it? CAS Designs has done the design for free. Wrapped Trade offered pre-COVID, so I need to double check again, to make and sponsor the actual signs, and council have advised that they would install them for free. So there's no cost to the Cambridge Community Board. And what happens if we do not win in 2020? The signs can stay there or they can be removed. Most towns leave them up for a good couple of years, so that can be decided at a later stage.  Next slide. So council have advised that they'd like the community board to approve design and concept. And that next bit is now not relevant. So yeah, I guess I'm asking for feedback at this stage from council, community board, what your thoughts are on those signs.",

It's where we come off the motorway at Howe Tapu. It's where we, the new roundabout by the Velodrome is now the entrance to Cambridge. That's how most of the public is seeing the entrance to Cambridge, the new welcome to Cambridge sort of thing. It's coming off the,  expressway when you're heading north, down past the golf course. And the only other thing on there, I see we've got the big C. Yeah I'll come to that, don't panic. Sue may remember the big C from last year or the year before, whenever that is. Yes, yes we do remember the big C. Yeah, I just wondered, what about, it's just  I'm interested to see that that's what Kaz has come up with. I'm a bit surprised.

I guess, yeah, going back a good 20 years ago when I was at the eye site, we did use it quite regularly as Cambridge's brand. And I don't think it's lost or is at the end of its life. I think that it needs a refresh for sure and needs a whole bunch of community consultation around it. But I still think it's quite relevant for today.  I think we saw that when we tried to introduce a different brand that actually the general community really wanted and actually feel really aligned with that Town of Trees and Champions brand. So just on that, on a refresh for that brand and for any new Welcome to Cambridge signs,  I think that that sits very simply with Council. Our comms and marketing team, Charlotte, who heads it up, she needs to own the process. It's hers to do. So, I think, you know, we want to support and definitely do a lot of consultation and thanks for bringing it up. It has been raised before and it is definitely on Charlotte's list of things to do, I think, for this coming year.  I raised that with Charlotte and Amber and they're really keen to to progress on this so this they sort of advise we get this Keep New Zealand Beautiful sorted and then we look at the next piece and they also said that when and if these Keep New Zealand Beautiful signs go up there needs to be a little bit of PR come from them",

So on the keep, on the keep, yeah, the Cambridge beautiful, the new signs that you wanted to pop up.  They are a bit bland. I think we can do better. And I think that that C brand has to go.

It doesn't really present a nice welcome for our visitors and as a local  not feeling particularly proud of them at the moment. So it doesn't reflect the rest of the town and how well it's maintained and how beautiful it is. So I just wanted to draw to your attention about getting it updated. If we go to the next slide, there are some provisions in the town concept plan around major gateway signage and some wayfinding. So it got me thinking about, again, a disjointedness. We've got a few signs here and there about walkways, and we've got a few signs for  the welcome to Cambridge, but we don't have one brand look and feel to it. So I just thought this was a good opportunity to try and achieve that. So go to the next slide. Yeah, my question was around that town concept land, and maybe it's more of a council question, but the gateway signs, are they also intended to be our welcome signs or are they separate? So for example, at the Avanti drum, you've got the nice sculpture going up in the middle of the roundabout.  Is that what they mean by gateway signs? Maybe, Liz, you might be able to answer this. Or are we still talking about having a welcome to Cambridge sign a bit further out with their new gateways?",

And given the current environment, we were simply going up, we were out for consultation on the design, but I think the entire world has changed since we went out for consultation. So whether that actually proceeds or not, will be an annual plan discussion that councillors will have.  So yeah, so look, we need to have a bit of a think about what signage we do want, but it won't be in the middle of a roundabout, but it will be, I think, at the main entrances to town. Okay, cool.",

So if we think to be skipped to the next one, and even also, I guess a bit of background there on why we need a bit of a,  bit of a brand. It does create that sense of identity and unity, it boosts tourism, it gives us a marketing toolbox to use as well, but it really says something about where you are and hopefully it's attractive and makes people want to live and play and visit there. So the next slide just gives you a bit of example, Hansburg, I just don't know where that is, but just shows you what I mean by that toolbox or that cohesive brand. So you've got your welcome signs and this is by no means what I think it should look like,  but you've got your welcome signs, you've got your cycleway, you've got your parking, you've got your library signs and you've got your flags on your street lights. So that's kind of what I'm angling at, I guess, is to try and achieve that throughout the town. We look at the next one.  This is just an example of what good, in my opinion, looks like, and there are different opinions out there, but this is a brand that started off as being graffitied on the footpaths in Dunedin by a local brand company, and it just took off and got picked up, and it's now universally used throughout Dunedin. It's on their council websites, their iSite websites. It's on their airport now. It's on their everything from locally made peanut butter and beer to these welcome signs.  that's been really picked up and identified with. If we flick to the next one. So this is just highlighting kind of the current state of our signs. And you can flick through those, sorry, Kieran, just bit by bit to show people. That's the golf course ones. And then coming in at Cambridge Park.  So this is an example of what I thought, you know, just teases really of what good might look like for a Cambridge sign. And you'll notice I haven't got welcome in there. A lot of places don't now, they just have a bit of a statement. The Te Awa Life Care Village one, I thought it's really classy and it's also used over at Cambridge Park or somewhere over that side of town. I can't quite remember now. Yeah, yep.  So last slide I think. So yeah to conclude I'd just like to see the signage implemented and that celebrated more as a town and then yeah just see if we can't work on those gateways and why finding and grand I guess for Cambridge but yeah my question is perhaps it's not community board perhaps it's more Waipae Council starts at the top and works its way down not too sure.

So, just to start by outlining that this document is currently out for public feedback. We did kick off this engagement process prior to the Alert Level 3 and 4 lockdown.  the process was due to come to a conclusion and we were approached directly by one party seeking an extension. So, that did occur. And then our elected members of council provided a direction to staff that no community engagement processes would come to an end during the COVID-19 lockdown. So, the direction that we've provided and communicated out to the community is that this community engagement process will remain open  until such time as council offices reopen to the public. So, Justine, if it's OK with you, I'll hand over to you just to provide a brief summary of the status of the document and what it's seeking to achieve. And then either of us can be available to respond to questions. Thank you.",

This is about 66 hectares for residential development going on sort of in the  in Leamington, so just balancing out some of that CBD, making sure that stays in the middle of the town, balancing out all the development we've got going on in the northern areas of Cambridge. So as I said, it's for residential development, so we'll be getting 12 to 15 lots per hectare in there.  So Kirstie sort of talked a little bit to this that it's this is a feedback process this is not a legislative or or this is a or a statutory process so we're not as sort of in a plan change or anything like that we just want to go out and get just some feedback from the community on the draft plan.  So the draft structure plan has actually been produced based on technical reports. So we've had things like geotechnical, three waters, transportation, ecological, archaeological reports produced for the structure plan.  And it is intended to be high level. We just want to sort of show people where we sort of think the roads and houses should go. And it also just shows the intention for connectivity, allowing for walking and cycling, protecting that gully, making sure people can kind of access it. And we can really enhance that feature because it is a really, really cool space and our Parks and Reserves team are very keen to sort of keep it, maintain it and enhance it.  already touched on the fact that the feedback process is open until council is open until the council offices are open. And, yeah, we're expecting sort of five to six hundred houses in there. Greg Morgan Fantastic.",

So, you know, I'm fairly confident that those houses, you know, the residents of those houses nearby would find it easy to access those open space areas without even having to go on the road. They could, you know, take the path that we've got shown along the edge of the gully.  to access those open space areas as we have them shown. We've also got walking and cycling connection through to the south down to the greenbelt and also to the north to be able to sort of head into town and also access the bottom sort of northern end of that gully where there's that flat and there's a lake and everything there so the idea is that that would be enhanced as well for public use certainly.",

I think we need to be really proactive with creating significant outdoor space for kids and community to connect rather than just perhaps token small areas. I think that massively enhances community well-being. The other thing, and I haven't walked through that gully, but I just wondered if there were ways  that we could be a bit more creative or more creative with our cycling tracks to sort of plug people into other parts of Leamington and into Cambridge even faster than traveling along the traditional arterial routes that the cars are driving on?

Now, the reason for that is because the sides of the gully are actually really quite steep and heavily vegetated. So we actually wanted to retain some of that vegetation, especially at sort of the southeastern end of that gully when we had that ecological  survey done they said look it's actually in pretty good condition at that top end so certainly the ecological advice is really just to sort of leave it alone so that's why we've put that shared walk and cycle path at the top. That also ties in quite nicely with a stormwater solution that's been proposed as part of the three waters technical report that we've received and that talks about sort of a swale system  that would run sort of alongside that as well. It would basically just be like a grassy depth. You wouldn't necessarily have water in there sitting or anything like that. And so that would run along that path as well. And it also means that you have your building and fence setbacks that are required by geotechnical, or sorry, that is in line with geotechnical advice that we've received with regard to the stability of that slope.

    "text": "That would be great, thank you. Thanks, Joe. OK, Roto. Also, the cemetery staff. Yes.  We had a wee incident today where I put my foot down and just told him that he had to have a bit of compassion. The rules are that we can have 10 people at a cemetery plus staff, plus a minister. Now, there is no limits on how many staff we can have there. We had 10 people, we had a minister, and we had four staff there because we were live streaming it for the other 50 or 60-odd that weren't able to be there.  And the sexton came across and threatened to shut me down. I said, just bring it on. That's not happening. And he said, yeah, it is. Anyway, I told him that if he wished, he could go and ask the deceased sister which nephew or niece he hated the most and get them to leave the cemetery. It's been really tough and quite  hard on families. They made the family feel very unwelcome, which was rather an embarrassment. I happened to be sitting on as a funeral director on the council's NZCCC, and we all agreed that, yes, we are  trying to stick to 10 as much as possible, but you have to show compassion when there's 11 or when there's nine, you know, you've just got to... You can't tell some grandchild that, well, I'm sorry, you're the 11th grandchild, you're the ugly one, you need to stay home. So just bringing it to the attention of everyone, because it's not really appropriate that these guys throw a Hollywood in front of families saying that there's 11 or 12 people here.",
