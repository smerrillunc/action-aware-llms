That's a reasonably well-worn agenda, and it makes a lot of sense. People are happy with that.  Yep. Okay, so we need a mover and a seconder.

Roger, you've done the second best thing, which is the second and also to raise your hand at the same time or yell at me, which is great. And I've also checked with Ken, I think our practice here is when I ask for  either support or voting against it, you use your voice. And if it doesn't appear to be majority, we can always go back to using the reactions or whatever. So in that good form, I will move. Roger, thank you for seconding that we confirm the agenda.

    "text": "Okay, so we'll go through this. There's a few key topics we're going to talk about. As Bruce has alluded to, we are slap bang in the middle of the renewal process for you. The policies are due 1 November. Ken was part of a team who presented to the London markets about two weeks ago.  in the evenings to line up with London Times. That was around the infrastructure insurance program, which relates to your reticulation assets, the three waters, that sort of stuff. I think again, slightly strained circumstances doing all this through VC, but I think it was well-received and we've had some positive feedback from the markets. The markets very much like engaging with people rather than just sort of faceless numbers and spreadsheets. So Ken, thank you for your time doing that.  And also we did the same to the local markets again via VC. So hopefully all these buttons work. Yeah, I'll give you a quick overview of the global market. Now, this was written in Q1. And  The comments there refer to all types of insurance. This is sort of an overview of the global market. And as you will see, there isn't much green in there. We are largely looking at sort of red and ambers, but that is in relation to all policies and is not territory specific.  So we have seen again, certainly in the property space, the biggest driver is natural disaster weather events. There was the horrific flooding in Germany. There's been other wildfires. They are just continuing with frequency and severity. So from a property point of view, that is what is driving the global market.  At the time this was written, the COVID losses hadn't materialized. However, there are still a couple of court cases going on offshore about how insurance policies should or shouldn't respond to that. So that is a little caveat at the moment. But one piece of good news is, and think of this almost as a supply and demand type situation, insurance premiums have increased over the last three to five years.  With that increase, the premium base has shifted upwards. So that now means that there is alternative capacity. Providers are coming in with capital. They didn't want to play in the insurance market three to five years ago because the premiums were too low.  Now that the premiums are coming up, there are other institutions who are prepared to put capital into the insurance market. So that is a good sign. That is a hopeful sign that we may be looking to a stabilisation of rating. So that's the sort of global comment. This was written in Q1, Q2.  If we just look at the arrows, and then I'll talk about New Zealand specifically. So the material damage business interruption, so this is your property program. We have seen historically pricing increasing. We have seen insurers look in high risk areas to drive limits down. This is the overall amount of cover that you can buy.  We have seen insurers look at deductible levels, retentions, how much are you carrying to your own balance sheet for various risks, and they're also trying to narrow down the breadth of cover. The obvious example is there are now very clear, concise exclusions as to how the pandemic infectious diseases clauses apply, or don't, as the case may be.  This slide shows that there has been a reduction in capacity. That's actually turned a corner now since it was produced. But probably the biggest component is that we are still seeing that increase in natural disaster weather events and natural catastrophe losses. So we can't get away from that. Now, what I will say is for New Zealand,  we are actually seeing a slowing down of rating increases if you're located in a relatively benign natural disaster area. And primarily we're talking about earthquake. Now, I got into trouble a few years ago when I said the Waikato doesn't have an earthquake exposure. It absolutely does, but compared to other parts of New Zealand, it is relatively benign.  So currently our expectation for the material damage and business interruption rating is between 5 to 10% increase.  We have some of the councils who are due in June, and they are again, not in a particularly poor seismic area. And they saw rating increases that are euphemistically called mid single digits. So you're talking 5%. And we indications from the market currently is hopefully that's where we're going to be sitting. That is a slowdown.  and is perhaps the first sign that for those less risky, less high seismic areas, we are seeing a turn in the market, which is good news because we've been through a very tough market for everybody. That's a brief snapshot of the material damage and business interruption.  The professional indemnity is a slightly different space. We are seeing pricing increasing across the board. Now, this isn't a Council-specific comment. I will come to some Council-specific issues in a second.  We're seeing, we have seen an increase in pricing. We have seen insurers try and write back the cover. So they're putting endorsements onto policy to limit exposures. And we're also seeing a reduction in this market of capacity. Claims are not going away. They are continuing to occur. Now, the party in New Zealand for local authorities  is largely driven around losses relating to building consenting issues. There have been a number of high profile cases. The Bella Vista apartment block, which is in the public domain, is an example of that.  We have been through three lead insurers on the liability placement for over the last six years. So insurers have come in, they've offered to lead the programme, and then they've left because the claims have been too high. We are currently, the programme is led by a company called Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway is obviously a huge financial institution.  They don't have terms dictated to them by reinsurance. Berkshire Hathaway don't buy reinsurance, therefore they underwrite everything themselves. And they are committed to the local authority space. Now, a couple of years ago, they did increase premiums quite dramatically. They felt there needed to be a market correction. It had been underpriced previously.  The information we are being given from them at the moment is that we're not expecting to see those dramatic premium increases again. They seem to be quite comfortable with where things are at now in that they are collecting a sufficient premium in their mind for the potential exposures. They will be looking at  how to improve areas in relation to building consenting. What are you doing about internal communications? And this isn't a wiper comment, this is a general council portfolio comment. So we are working with the council to get an understanding of how that stuff works. There were some additional questions on the proposal form that needs to be done every year, specifically around the building consenting. So hopefully for this renewal,  we again should be looking at relatively flat numbers in terms of pricing. That's quite a bold statement on my part, which is why I say relatively flat. But that is sort of the expectation that we're at at the moment.  I go to the next slide. So one of the things that we have embarked on with councils and WIPER are doing this, which is why colleague of mine, ours, Matt Bilderbeck is here, because we ran something called an insurable risk profile with yourselves. Now, this is again, a generic historic comment. For a lot of local authorities, insurance over the last  10 years has been a transactional purchase. You have a list of insurance policies that you need, you go out and buy them. Now, the diagram that's on the screen, hopefully that you can see is a sort of paradigm for working out how much insurance you need. If you look at the very top left-hand quadrant that says optimizing insurance, I've had a lot of local authorities come to me and say, we need an insurance strategy.  And the driving factor for them saying, we need an insurance strategy has been the fact that their premiums have increased year on year on year on year. And if you're getting a 20, 25% increase in your insurance premiums, and you do that for four years, you've got 100% increase. That was not sustainable. But the problem with that conversation is it's a little bit tail wagging the dog. The insurance spend was being used as a trigger for an insurance strategy.  it should actually be a risk mitigation, risk understanding strategy that then leads into, okay, we understand this, how much insurance do we need to buy? And then you're making a more informed decision. And again, this is a generic council comment. You're not being a taker of what the insurance market is prepared to give to you. You're actually structuring a program for your needs. So,  This year we have gone through sort of this cycle, and we are still going through it. It is iterative, it will refine, etc, etc.  So part of that was this risk positioning piece and determining risk. Now, loss modelling has been done in the past where you determine the financial exposures. That's the loss volatility and estimation. That's focused very much on the physical stuff. But these are all sections that we need to go through and understand.  And then as an organisation, you get to this point where you say, okay, well, we're happy to have X amount to our balance sheet, or we don't think that particular risk is so severe that we need to treat it with a risk transfer to an insurance programme. So we can then design collectively what an insurance programme should look like for you. So that's very much just a framework, but we are starting that journey with council.  And as always with these things, there has to be cost benefits, but you've got to understand all of that, what your risks are, what your exposures are, how you're prepared to treat them, before you can work out that cost benefit from an insurance point of view. This is very difficult just talking to a screen, by the way.  One of the first areas that we focused on, again, with all councils is better quality data. We need to know what you've got, where it is, how much it is worth, and what its exposures are. And that's quite simplistic. If you think about buildings or infrastructure, that's the sort of information that we need to have. And we've worked with council to improve the quality of that data  to get better information so that everybody knows we're working with the best information available. That then can lead into the whole determining the risk appetite, the risk tolerance within the organization. And then that can, again, turn following that hexagon into what does an insurance program look like. But unless we have the values right in the first place, then it's very difficult to determine what those exposures actually are and quantify them into dollars.  we need to know the values are right. So that's a piece of work we've been doing, and Amy has provided us with property schedules and the like, so there's quite a lot of work's gone into that in the background for WIPA. Again, I think it's iterative, it can improve, and that's, again, a generic council comment, we can always improve this. So what can you do to manage those insurance costs?  So these are the questions that we ask. And this just isn't, what can you control and what can't you control? You can't control the insurance market. The insurance market is going to do what it does. I'm from the UK. The New Zealand market is a relatively small percentage of the global market. So there are other considerations that are outside of your control.  So the market will be what the market is. But what you can do is think about how you approach the market, how much insurance do we need to buy, those sort of conversations. So these are just sort of some highlights of key points there. Now, there's a number of sort of animations that come on this side. And this is almost a little bit sort of insurance 101. Please, it's not meant to be conversating in any way. This is just how some of the things that we think about.  What you have here is sort of a loss curve. And if you imagine this is the pricing, so if you have high frequency, so those going up the left-hand side, but low cost, think motor insurance, then this is what kills insurance programs. It's the high frequency, low cost events. So the question that that then says is, where do you want to attach  All insurers understand that there might be the catastrophic event that sits out right on the extreme right-hand edge. They are high value, high severity, but they are low frequency. Insurers buy insurance, insurers reinsure, the insurers reinsure, etc, etc. So what we have to look at is the impacts that the market has or where you position yourself on this curve.  So again, if you take that dotted red line, you can think of that as what the market is currently doing. The pricing has gone up. That's why we're shifting above that black line. And when you get into soft markets, the pricing can come down. So the next animation is, so if we then take that, we understand that where that blue line and the black line intersect, if we imagine that's where your deductible is, your excess,  As you can see on the pricing, this curve, if you were to shift that to, if you keep that as it is, sorry, anything to the left of that line is what you pay yourself. It's your deductible. And again, think your motor insurance with your 500 bucks or your household insurance with your $250,000, whatever it might be. That's the deductible component. The second component is how much insurance do we buy?  Do we buy insurance for the absolute catastrophic event? Now, I know we're being broadcast live, but I'll give you a genuine example if I get asked, is if I do one of these in Topol, somebody says to me, well, what happens if the lake goes up? And the response is normally, well, it's such a major national catastrophe, do we want to be looking at an insurance program  but it's going to cost a lot of money to buy billions and billions of dollars worth of cover when actually the chance of it happening are very, very remote. So what is the maximum probable loss that you want to look at? So the amount of insurance then that you buy also impacts the cost of the insurance program. I'm hoping this is all making sense. It's none of this is rocket science.  So now we've got two blue areas on the diagram, which are both effectively self-insured or uninsured. You've set a loss limit at a certain point, and you've set a deductible at a certain point. The insurance covers the bits in between. The deductible is for your own balance sheet. And if there's a catastrophic loss, then there's, again, either your own balance sheet or a different funding mechanism comes in depending on what the loss is.  So what are the impacts of moving those deductibles? If you shift the deductible to the right, you see you come further down on the pricing scale. So by electing, and again, the easiest example is your own domestic insurances, for example, you've got a $500 deductible on your household insurance and you shift that to a $2,000 deductible, you should see a reduction in your pricing because you are moving the attachment point of the insurer further to the right of that curve.  And then that's where you get the green graphic. Conversely, if you go the other way, you increase the pricing. If you elect to go from 2,000 to 500, your pricing is going to go up. And again, simple concept, same with the loss limit. If you buy less insurance, you will have less cost, but you have a greater exposure to your balance sheet.  If you buy more insurance, you go to the right side, you get the red markers, you have an increase in cost. Now, this is all relatively straightforward, but then I'll just go through all of these animations. So again, we've got that point where we established the pinky bit in the middle is the bit you're in buying insurance. This is somebody else's capital you are buying to deal with those problems. Why are values important?  If the values are accurate, and the loss modelling has been done is accurate, and that is largely determined, the accuracy of that is largely determined by the quality of the data. If that's all accurate, you can comfortably set a loss limit. However, if the values are incorrect, you can end up with stuff that's sitting in the blue.  So one of the bodies of work that we've done with councils over a number of years, this is, as I said, historically insurance is dealt with by finance teams. There's nothing against finance teams. Finance teams always operate on depreciated replacement costs. They're knocking the numbers back as the lifespan of the asset decreases.  What we want on an insurance program is your replacement cost, not a depreciated number. Because if we're using depreciated numbers, there is the possibility that you could end up with stuff being in the blue sector, because we've faced a loss limit on a depreciated cost, not a replacement cost. Wiper are pretty good at this. We've done a lot of work with the guys over the last 18 months, two years having this conversation, and there's been an improvement in that.  Also, changing values may mean that you can move the deductible... Oh, I've gone too far. Sorry. Changing values may mean that actually we're over-insuring.  If you are disinvesting in assets, if you are changing what your portfolio looks like, you may end up, the limit we've set previously is no longer required and you can come back a bit. These are just considerations and this is all part of that original hexagon that we put on the screen about going through a process to understand what you've got, where it is, what's its exposures. Next slide, isn't it? So we call this a leader's presentation because  As I said, you can't change the market, but there are some things you can call, some leads you can call to change some of the values of your insurance program, the deductibles, et cetera, et cetera. And this is just a real summary. What is controllable? Yours, mine, his, mine. Active engagement with the markets. And I said, I started off saying that Ken was part of a team that presented to the London markets. That's absolutely key. The insurers knowing who you are, seeing that you're real people,  seeing that you're taking this stuff seriously really helps with that relationship. And then retention, what can we retain? Are there properties that you have that you wouldn't actually rebuild? If you lost it, would you rebuild it? If the answer's no, why are we insuring it? Now, I know there are political considerations within that, and I'm not going to go down that at the moment, but  That's just a process to think, what would we replace? Would we replace it? So then your appetite, how strong is your balance sheet? What are you prepared to accept? And then it's slightly obscure on my screen, but it's all the reinstatement values sufficient. Have we got the numbers right? So those are the sort of conversations and considerations that we're having at the moment.  I come from a small business background. We can have these lovely conversations up here, but I am always the one that asks the question to my colleagues, okay, so what's the cost benefit? And I'll make no bones about this. We could have, and we will do this, we're starting to do the modeling in preparation for the renewal. We're doing something called as-if modeling. So what we're taking is wipers, material damage and business interruption claims history over the last five years on the current deductible level.  We are then putting a number of options on that. So if we shift the deductible by an amount, what does that actually mean? A, if someone is wiper to it, you use the last five years claims history as an example. And B, what do we think that's going to do to the premiums? Now, I don't know the outcome of the premium conversation yet, and we're still finalizing the as-if modeling. But when I say I'm the one that asked the question,  If we come back to Council at renewal and say, we can save you $20,000 on your insurance premiums for your material damage and business interruption, but it means you increasing your deductible to $250,000. And given the last five years claims history, that meant you would have spent an extra, let's say $350,000 on claims for your own balance sheet.  The question to be asked is, is a saving of $20,000 sufficient to warrant moving the deductible? And I fully understand that there has to be that right cost benefit. So that is what we will be reporting back at renewal as we get all the terms back, a number of excess options, and whether there is deemed to be sufficient cost benefit to you to make that decision.  So that's sort of the culmination of the other bits and pieces that leads to that. I think that's the last bit I've got. Yeah, so I'll now get Matt Bilderbeck to talk to you. This is, as I said at the outset, we did an insurable risk profiling, oh God, some time ago now, but COVID got in the way, all sorts of things. So this is a summary of that, and I'll pass this over to Matt to talk about.",

    "text": " Thanks, Matt. So to recap, there are some positive signals from the market, but we're still in a challenging insurance market. And that means that we need a strategic approach to get the best outcomes. So basically to summarize all the text in this slide, what that means is a shift from decisions based on historical approaches or what has always been done to transparent decisions based on documented evidence  and analysis that's part of an integrated risk strategy. We can probably jump on to the next slide, Matt. So on that basis, we've gone through the process of evaluating your risk profile against our framework, which is shown here. We included your staff in that process in the workshop. As Matt said, that was held some time ago when they still let me out of the house.  And we suggest you consider implementing these recommendations basically to make sure that you can continue getting the right insurance for you at the best possible price, best terms and conditions. So I'll talk through the top three recommendations here and provide a bit more background to those. The first one is around enterprise risk management. So that's your overarching drive of your approach to insurance.  Now, like Matt was saying, typically insurance has been seen as a procurement item, or a finance item, and risk management has been seen as something separate. But in reality, insurance is a risk management tool, and it should be considered in the context of other risk management options. Things like the potential to avoid an activity, thereby avoiding the risk altogether, the potential to reduce the likelihood or consequence of a risk, options to transfer the risk contractually,  or simply accepting a level of residual risk based on your risk appetite and the strength of your balance sheet. The second recommendation relates to your material damage policy and your infrastructure policy. It's about your processes for selecting what assets make it onto your schedule and the sums insured of those assets. So you can insure every single one of your assets if you like, but you don't have to.  There may be particular assets that you decide to self-insure because you see them as being particularly low risk, or you simply wouldn't replace them if they were damaged. And the point is we recommend formal processes around those decisions. We also recommend reviewing your asset valuations to make sure they're suitable for insurance purposes. As Matt said, you've made some good progress in this area already, but it's worth recapping.  If you think you would replace an asset like-for-like following a loss, you need an insurance reinstatement value. And that will consider things like demolition costs and an inflationary provision. Otherwise you could find yourself underinsured. But again, there might be assets that you don't want to replace like-for-like, and you might just want to insure them for removal of debris or for an indemnity value. The third recommendation relates to your infrastructure insurance.  You buy infrastructure cover as a group as part of the Waikato Last, and as a group, you have quite a substantial loss limit. There was some modelling done to inform that back in 2016. We recommend an update to that to account for changing asset base, new modelling methodologies. Also, as a council, you have a sublimit of $80 million. So you have over 600 million of infrastructure assets  But if there were an earthquake, and we're talking low likelihood, but centred in your district, you'll only ever get up to that $80 million between insurance and central government support. So we recommend reviewing that limit, that sublimit, based on analysis of your exposures, and that would be in the form of infrastructure loss modelling, and we produce what we call a probable maximum loss estimate for an earthquake event.  So we think those three recommendations are your biggest bang for buck in terms of benefits you could get. And we think they'll get you looking at insurance strategically as part of a wider risk management process. It's gonna help protect your balance sheet and your community by ensuring you ensure assets for the right amount and making sure those limits align with your exposures.  Again, yeah, we just recommend taking an insurance approach because the costs of insurance are increasing, and in certain cases, availability is reducing. Thank you, Matt, to summarize.",

    "text": " Thank you, Matt. There is currently a piece of high level loss modelling work being done for the Waikato councils. Once we get the results from that, then we can potentially have further conversations with WIPA directly as to whether there's any anomalies in there. So we're doing a region wide piece currently.  at no cost to the council. That was part of a recent tender process that we went through probably 18 months ago now. So there's some work being done in that space. We have also, you haven't seen it yet, but it will be with you shortly. Matt spoke about asset selection. What would you ensure? Do you want to ensure everything?  Our valuations team have put a guide together for an asset selection process, which will be sent in the next couple of days.  When we spoke to other councils, it became relatively clear that there was no formal asset selection process. So Hita Ercik, our valuations manager, has engaged with probably about 25, 30 councils and taken their various responses and sort of wrapped them all into one guideline, as it were, which highlights some of the processes that might need to be considered.  And the last piece that we're currently working on is some education modules to assist with yourselves, members of audit and risks, et cetera, et cetera. How insurance works, what are some of the considerations in this whole risk framework that need to be considered?  Again, it all links to that better data gives better outcomes. And whilst we are obviously more than happy to do audit and risk presentations, have these conversations with you, if we can provide some documentation that can be shared, which allows for yourselves to get an understanding of some of the conversations that we're having, you can see this stuff in front of you. Hopefully that will help in the decision making process. I think that is us.  Yeah, that's us. So thank you for your time. Is there any questions?",

So once we get that information back, then we will be able to report back to you as to, okay, this is what the premiums are compared to last year. This is what your values have done. Here are two or three options that you can decide upon.  And these changes can be done post-renewal.  Once you get a one November renewal date, if we're then able to have a bit more of a deep dive, you know, the next audit and risk meeting or whatever it is, if that's a month after renewal, we can always make those decisions then and change. So you're not fixed once you've got to one November. That's just the anniversary date of the policy. But as I say, hopefully we'll be able to have those options come back to you  and see what the changes are. As I said, I'm the one that always asks the question, what's the cost benefit? My historic experience with councils is that they are conservative with a small C. And I fully understand the reasons why behind that.

I think we can, again, depending on cost benefits and your own appetite, look to refine it even further.  You're going down the track, and it's a good conversation to have.

The conversation I'm having with you in about five minutes, we're doing another one of these to Ruapehu District Council, I will be having exactly the same conversation with them. It is iterative, it can be done better. Is there an appetite to do that better? Does it make anything substantial to your exposures? Does it make anything substantial to your cost savings?  Is it worth pursuing forwards? But that phrase, well, we've done it like that for the last 10 years. Why fix it if it ain't broke sort of thing? Well, let's just explore it in a bit more detail and see where we can move down that path.

But the whole thing, like there's, as Matthew mentioned, there's effectively elements of self-insurance involved in this. And I guess on the left hand,  side of Matthew's graph, that is undertaken on a day-to-day basis. It's the smaller things, the excesses on vehicles, etc. On the other side of the graph, that's the major disasters or whatever.  While, I guess, to a large extent, we're expecting central government to pick up the tab on those events, is it worth looking at placing some of the premium that we would have paid into an investment-type situation to  allow us to grow our capacity to deal with the bigger events that come up instantly without going through the process of going to central government, et cetera. I guess that's my question. Have we considered that at all? Even on the other side of it, shifting that left-hand vertical pillar to the right to take care of the bigger, more common events,  Is some self-insurance via a setting aside of effectively what the premium you would have paid, you know, does that make sense?

So, you know, that reinforces the importance of that. In the infrastructure space, Andrew, you commented on the 60-40 arrangement with the Crown. Yeah, clearly we do have quite considerable reliance there. But look, several years ago, we put in place, and in fact it's referred to in the report on the agenda, the infrastructure insurance primary layer.  So, yeah, so councils actively, the Waikato councils at least, actively involved in, you know, addressing the risk in terms of the primary layer. But of course, you know, in the wake of a catastrophic type disaster, you know, obviously still reliance on the Crown under that 60-40 arrangement.

    "text": " Yeah, if I may just add to that, the as-if modelling that I mentioned earlier on, that's its primary function, is to allow you to see, okay, if we move the deductible along the curve, so we expose ourselves at a balance sheet level to a certain amount, what are we saving in premium?  That will hopefully allow that sort of informed decision to be made, because it is those low value frequency events, they're the ones that are going to cost and you're quite right with the analogy, the motor insurance. If we use that for the material damage and your deductible, I think at the moment is  $10,000, that's off the top of my head, is that correct? For say a fire loss. In the corporate world, that's a really, really small number. A similar size property owner in the corporate space would be looking at 150 to 250, some even up as much as sort of 500 to a million. But what are we going to get by premium relief?  And that's the the point of the as if modeling and that can be undertaken on a couple of other policies as well. The motor insurance is in relative terms quite cheap at the moment so I wouldn't currently advocate looking at doing anything there.  However, certainly on the material damage, there is that consideration to be made, which is what we're hopefully we'll be able to report back to you this time around and say, if you go from here to here, it's going to save you 50,000 bucks. Is that sufficient for you to make that decision with a rough understanding of what you're going to have exposed? The problem at the other end, in terms of on the diagram where I showed you, you reduce the loss limits. The problem with that is if you have two,  You might have a fund of money that, okay, if you buy, and I'm just making the numbers up, let's say you buy $100 million worth of cover for the catastrophe type event, and you might have a little bit in the kitty, I don't know, I've got no idea, but you might have a little bit in the kitty that you'll, if it's 110 or 120 million, then you're okay. The problem is what happens if we have two?  And yes, statistically, it's unlikely, but it might happen. And it's just understanding that cumulative effect of some of those exposures as well.",

I just wanted to raise that. It came up in the Pirongi Award Committee because a lot of the people there look after their community halls. And at the moment we have a $10,000 excess for fire loss and other major damage. But the thing is what council is doing  is expecting those community hall associations to meet that excess. And so I just wanted to flag either, particularly to you Ken, that if you are considering increasing the excess that in that particular situation, it's quite a lot of money to come up with for those  know, whole associations, and that I just wanted you to safeguard that really, if you were thinking of increasing the excess.",

I had wondered how you're going to make the $500,000 excess, which perhaps we might be saying is low, but under infrastructure insurance we actually have a reserve or we just use our debt.  I'm just interested in that. The other thing was with the cyber security, the limit of liability was a million dollars, and I think probably I've seen that as being a number pretty much standard around the sector. Perhaps not inconsistent with your question, Clare, I was wondering whether that was actually enough, perhaps in light of the Waikato DHB experience. But I guess probably what would always interest me is what would come under that, given the extraordinary cost that I suspect Waikato had to go to internally to actually just deal with the issue.",

So this has gone through a number of discussion rounds with the executive team, and they have reached an agreement in regards to these.  I'm not gonna go through all the detail. I guess the first document what we're looking from you is that you're comfortable with the top risks, the description, the ratings, and the mitigants. The second attachment around the risk appetite statement, it's a portfolio-based approach to assessing what our risk appetite is. Just a point of note there that a new portfolio has been specifically added post the fraud order around  what council's risk appetite is for fraud, bribery and corruption. So that's now a separate portfolio that has been rated separately. And so from that document, what we're looking for is that you are comfortable with the risk appetite ratings that have been selected there.

George, I just thought with the top risks, I just felt there's been a bit of movement and not that I'm wanting to change the document itself, but just to get some comments from you. Firstly, the number three, which is failure to respond to COVID-19, which is very high residual. I actually think council's done really well in the resurgence  context and given the government's commitment I think to also provide support, I was just wondering whether or not you thought that might be able to be reduced a little bit. You probably have seen more behind the scenes about how everyone's coped with the current resurgence and of course we do have future ones to consider although the drive for vaccination I think is certainly  looks like, you know, that's the strategy the government wants and perhaps it is going to reduce the risk further. And then ones that have increased recently, I thought were the risk about the community responding to council decisions. So that's number eight and perhaps also  relationships with key stakeholders. Just from the resident perceptions survey that we got, which I found really disappointing, a lot of reductions, quite significant reductions really, on some of those key questions, certainly about reputation and trust of council. And then other two that have been elevated would be the information,  management assets like cyber attacks, as I raised in the insurance discussion, and the Three Waters reform, which personally I think is getting a little bit more uncertain. Yeah, so interested in your comments on those ones?",

So these have obviously been  discussed quite extensively by the executive team. So in regards to COVID, the sentiment is really around the level of uncertainty. There's still quite a high level of uncertainty in terms of the impact of it. And I guess when infometrics come and present, et cetera, that would be the sentiment that is portrayed there. So that's really the driver behind that one. Number eight, that's new, and that is in direct response to COVID.  Two, how the community feel about and respond in regards to some challenging conversations and discussions. And I guess that is hand-in-hand in regards to the resident perception survey results and the levers that we talked about there. So that risk has been added as a direct response to that. In terms of the information, one, yes, is obviously  Richard who's online here will be presenting later on a cyber security update. WIPO is in a good position, but I guess when you look at the external environment, you know the risks are increasing and that's what we heard just before with the insurance presentation too. In three waters reform, I guess there's an element of  you know, and Dawn can jump in here too, in regards to how it's rated, there's an element of, this is about being prepared for and planning rather than being ultimately in control of the outcome of that.

Just a reflection from me, and I started looking at the heat map and I wanted to reflect on what actually is our  overall appetite, because in some sense where we want to end up with risk is indicative of the effort that we're asking Gary and the team to put in. So as a proxy, dare I say it, for a lot of the detail in the succeeding pages, I want to look at that heat map and just spend a couple of minutes with you just looking at that. So if folk have got that heat map, you can see that actually the majority of risks  have probably a major effect with a range of possible through to almost certain. And we are clearly saying, because we've been asked, by the way, to adopt this report, we'll come back to those resolutions, that actually that isn't where we want to be as Waip\u0101 District Council.  And in fact, when you look at the majority of the bottom line, which is, I think while there's a slight difference in the key, they're basically yellowish on that heat map. At the bottom, you'll see that we want to be comparatively conservative. And I don't use that word as a pejorative, but in risk terms, we do want to lower our risks substantially.  A critical question for us, is that the council we want to be given these are our top risks? Okay, it's a question mark. Again, there's not a value judgment on that. It's a question, are we happy with that process? Because it will require, not only as we've seen from the diagram, existing mitigations,  But actually, dare I say it, spending money, if I can use an accountant's view of the world, spending money on additional mitigations to get it down to that point.  It may be difficult for me to ask these questions of you in that sort of comprehensive whole basis. I do remind you that when you get the benefit to do deep dives, we have a chance to reflect more on these on an individual basis. But at this point, I just wanted to pause the conversation and say, is this the line of direction?  which after all, we worked out with KPMG, et cetera, and George and Jenny have helped us with, is this the line of direction that we are comfortable taking? Does it feel that that bottom line is where we should be aiming for? Which means generally,  for any of these top risks, we are looking to minimise particularly the nature of the consequence or the impact, even if we can't necessarily deal with the likelihood. Any thoughts, questions, Faye? Yes, Claire.",

And I'm looking at the heat map and I'm,  I agree that I'm not that happy with the residual risk for a number of them, but I'm being pragmatic. And I'm thinking too that it's the way that we portray the sort of the final point of the particular risk, because it is true that we're wearing a much higher risk for some items because we know we don't control the outcome. You know, whether that's  COVID or whether it's the Three Waters reform or like the future of local government or whatever, you know, those ones. And I'm just wondering whether or not we could actually portray that in the diagram in some way that it might be a different colour where it's a risk because we, the position of it is because we know we don't have control over it. Yeah, because I do agree that  to get the risks down into the green area could take a phenomenal amount of investment, which we're just not able to do really. And I mean, if you like, like you could take that COVID one. Like I've seen the response that staff have been involved in recently for this latest outbreak. And I actually think they've done really well.  That's why I thought perhaps the position, I think it's number three, is it? Yeah, number three. It is relatively high there, but I feel that the particular risks that we're facing, the ones we have control over to do with COVID, I think they're covered off really well.

We are indeed facing an external, I was about to say an existential risk. You might think that in terms of Three Waters reform and RMA reform and future local government, but we are facing an externally driven risk primarily, which is after all what any organisation has to face.  be it the local government or private sector. There are always external drivers and these are impacting us. So, George, look, I pass that on. I mean, you've heard Claire's views, and it's perhaps not a bad one, that if it's something which has a higher uncontrollability, if I can call it that, because of its externality, it might be helpful for us to recognise that. I guess it does come through in the papers, but whether that's reflectable on a pink map, I'll let you, as gurus, think on that one.  So that's good. Are there any other questions?

Look, I was just gonna make the comment and I have in the past is that without an actual cost alongside of that heat chart is really hard to make a call on how far down we're going to drive those top risks.  And so I suppose I think getting back to Bruce's prompt is just how risk averse we want to be as a council. And it really is difficult to make that call without knowing what the actual costs are going to be.  So, Bruce, I was just commenting on your question, I suppose, in terms of the heat map. And just without knowing what the cost is to achieve the reduction heading down to the green, into the yellow and green area, it's really hard to make that call.  So, it's nothing, it's a bit like the insurance, there's nothing like having a bill at the end of the day to actually sharpen your attention to just how far you want to drive those, those risks down. So, yeah.  I'm probably more inclined to take a higher risk than others, but without knowing what the implications are in terms of cost, it's really hard to say definitively. And I wonder, and the issue that's been raised already in terms of issue three on COVID, whether there's been a change, certainly in the first,  outbreak, if you want to call it that, civil defense emergency kicked in with all of those statutory controls. The second time round that we're in now, it's a different proposition altogether in terms of our, I suppose, costs and liability. And we are getting  I suppose a lot more information on what the likely future reaction to a COVID outbreak will be and whether we are actually going to continue to drive to get rid of COVID out of our community or whether once we get 80, 90, whatever the figure is of the population vaccinated, we're just going to live with it and it won't actually become an issue. So,  Yeah, I just wonder, it might be too early at the moment, but certainly the COVID response may vary with increasing information. So that's just my comment on the heat maps anyway.",

We can probably, and we should argue the toss on some being perhaps slightly higher than others, but we will do that in the course of the life of the committee through, as I said, our deep dives and various staff reports. But I would have thought as a whole,  Moving to that bottom, that's yellow, at least on my diagram, those yellow dots in the green yellowy area is a probable position that we should be aiming for given these are our top risks.  There'll be a bunch of others that won't be necessarily there, but they're not ones that we've got a view on, and indeed, probably because their consequence is of a lesser nature. So I actually think we are in the right position generally with, as you say, Georgie, both our existing mitigants and those that are within the work programme. I mean, it's a judgment call that that's actually where it gets us to, but it's not necessarily unreasonable. Yes, Jim?",

Let's have a look at that as being a potential, at least indicator that we might be interested in when we come to it.  I think for the sake of both our time as a committee today and also in terms of the work that's in front of us, I think we, I feel comfortable and I'm not sensing people are allergic to these being either A, our 14 top risks or B, the relative positioning on it. What I do detect is that we want to manage it, sorry, to monitor it.  and indeed to assess where is the state of that risk. And I think that's been particularly around the point you've raised, Clare, around COVID.  Jim, you've raised a really good point about actually we do need to keep in our minds the extent of cost to achieve some of these things.

And so I would just say whether or not, is it appropriate for us to be reviewing the mitigants for that to see whether or not there should be something else being worked on just to respond?  I would not like to see that risk either deteriorate or get worse, I guess, because I'm certain that having a good reputation with our community is one of the central things that we need to function well as a council.

And I had noted here that the risk appetite was councillors, and in fact, accepts a high risk, a high targeted residual level. It isn't totally within the bounds of this committee to make a decision to say, is that acceptable or not? And I wanted to raise, I'm great on these rhetorical questions, aren't I? Are you guys happy with that? And you might say no, and I suspect you might be saying no. The question is what can be done about it?  And what would it cost? And actually, if we want a lower level, how would Gary be able to manage this?  And I mean, this is the value of the deep dive discussions. Another council, one of my commitments, councillors wanted a particular risk emphasised and the chief executive to say, well, that's fine, I can do that, but it's gonna divert resources and we have to have that discussion as well. I think that's where, I think we are agreeing, this sits here clear, but we do agree that actually the deep dives now all of a sudden become that much more real for us, if I can call it that, because when we,  you know, taken Ken's good paper, and I know I'm blending my agenda all over the place, it's gonna be critical that we have this page in front of us, and we say, yes, we're happy with that residual risk at the end of the page.  Okay, if we do that, are there any other burning questions in terms of, and we really haven't got to the risk appetite part, other than we have been trying to address risk appetite in the round, the generality and the way I've raised it. Are there other questions people would like to raise at this point on either the top 14 or the risk appetite paper at this point?  Well, I feel like we have done it justice, but not had enough time to do it even more justice, George and Jenny. So let's move to those recommendations. But as we do, as I'm going backwards in my agenda papers, just notice the risk network, which is the, what do you call it? The emitters and the receiver diagram, whatever we call it, it's on page 30.  That's a very valuable one to have, by the way, in our minds, which is that none of our risks generally stand in splendid isolation. We push one, something else gets affected, or something happens in one, it tends to have an effect somewhere else. So I presume in this diagram, George, COVID-19, growth, and the future of local government are the biggies. Am I right in saying that?",

But overall, we just wanted to make comment that it has been a relatively smooth process this time,  And I think that's from all the great planning that staff have done across the organisation and the lessons that have been learnt from the last round. The report references the policy rationalisation project, which is currently with the organisational charter just being finalised. And one of the things with that project is looking at what our policy templates look like for our internal policies.  and we are currently working on the risk and compliance policy using that new format to bring to AHRQ next time. There's reference in here to a framework for managing threats and aggressive customers looking to take a holistic approach and a framework approach to that piece of work and making sure that we have all the dots joined so that staff can easily understand how things fit together. You'll also see in the appendix that we have the scope of the internal audit of council's project and programme  practices there and happy to take comments on that scope. That audit will be commencing shortly. And then the quarterly risk report has got the top risks that you just went through. So they've been refreshed and you'll note the arrow indicating a trimmed upwards in risks associated with COVID recovery in the current environment.

So it's really another iteration of reinforcing the values work across the organization. And then,  it forms a basis to link those policies. So the policies aren't sitting out there on their own, they're linked back to this is how we work.

And there seems to be some challenges coming up from elsewhere. And with staff wellbeing in terms of working from home, you can see me race off an emergency, where the blend of family life and work life is becoming harder to balance.

Or actually, another council where they recognised 15 of their staff  are just not sort of people who are able to work easily at home. And now in lockdown too, this is clearly not Auckland, in lockdown too, they've been able to make certainly the people that are prioritised be able to be back at work in a place where they can be productive and feel safe. It's actually those sort of nuanced knowledge of actually how staff are operating.  Just the other thing that I noted there was a real risk, and it cropped up in my mind because it's happened elsewhere, is the privacy breach, which we are characterising as minor, and I appreciate that, and I think probably this is on a minor scale compared to the one that we've had to deal with another committee just recently.

It's probably the biggest risk that everybody talks about at the moment. Do we have, within the framework, the appropriate toolbox to be efficient in the way in which we go about not just our projects, but obviously the key part of it, how we procure and enable.  Now that might be making it out too further, but perhaps what I'd like to suggest is if there are any comments or observations which flow from doing this effective framework view, I think it would be good to recapture those.  Just a thought from me, I don't have to, I don't, you know, it's a big piece of work. I can see from the price, I don't want us to necessarily make this bigger than being here, but I'd like to just suggest to Benita that if there were observations that she thought, hmm, I wonder whether that's actually efficient or whether they could be doing something different that enables the project to go effectively.

So you've got essential in yellow, important, which is lower down in orange, and non-essential in green. And this is a different hierarchy to the other colors that are in our agenda for other reports, where I would have expected important to be yellow and essential to be amber or orange.  So when I first read through it, I didn't read the key, and I was looking at who was, there was a problem, I suppose, what was the challenge, and I just automatically gravitated to the amber.

    "text": " Thanks for Easton, good morning. So I'll take the report as read, but would summarize key points. So we're using SAMHSA compliance as a framework to report cybersecurity conformance to good practice. The framework allows benchmarking against peer organizations with similar complexity and risk profiles, and it's been a really helpful tool for managing tasks and monitoring progress.  There's been some additional capacity freed up within the IT team to focus on cyber security improvements. This is really helping keep a focus on security mitigants. We're collaborating with other councils and we've established a technical working group and this group has jointly developed a cyber security incident response plan and virtual response team with supporting processes and this would be used by our CMT in response to a cyber event.  And internally staff are participating in online cyber security awareness training and we're seeing a positive result in testing behaviors. So staff are becoming aware of suspicious activity and reporting it and or not following it. And all this work is kind of ongoing in combination with other organizational priorities. So I guess that's the summary of the report. And are there any kind of questions",

    "text": " Absolutely, kia ora koutou. Just further to my report, I guess a couple of key highlights and achievements that the teams have made is around the development and endorsement of the activity management framework and our work programme. So that's, as I say, it's been a very inclusive process. It's involved interviewing staff to get that input, but we've got a very clear work plan moving forward. So as I say,  It's been a key highlight, and as indicated in the report, the next sort of steps are looking at our activity management policy, and that work's just kicking off at the moment, and then moving through to the development of our strategic activity management plan.  So that is a piece of work that we're going to be bringing in some external resource to help us with to get that well shaped up, but very much connecting to the great skills and knowledge that we've got inside the organization.  Another quick update in terms of you will have seen that we've completed the work on the roadmap in terms of our organisation moving to be a strategy-led organisation, which is a really cool aspiration to have and something that we've been achieving across the board, but in this case particularly.  So yeah, it's really cool. We've got that framework in place, and whilst the content within it, in terms of as we move through into our next LTP, we'll re-look at some of those components, we've got the framework there that's locked in. So as I say, that's again something to celebrate in terms of achievements.  One other further item I just wanted to touch on, so yet to commence, and I know this has been a sort of question from this particular committee in the past, is around our resourcing around activity management.  And it's a matter of, as an organisation now, we're obviously looking at our resourcing across a number of areas, looking at future of local government and those sorts of things. So rather than doing a separate piece of work, we're waiting and seeing how this is going to fit into that wider programme of what is the right size business for what that future holds for Waipara District.  So that one's just sitting there waiting at the moment. And the other item around when KPMG came in and did the audit and looked particularly at our operational contracts in our waters delivery area, that was prior to the restructure of our waters team and we had only just moved into an external sort of formal contract around our stormwater  sort of delivery and management rather than more of an ad hoc process previously. So whilst we have yet to commence in there, we've certainly done a lot of work in that space and anecdotally I've got some really cool feedback in terms of  not only we are a lot better at vesting our stormwater assets that are coming into us, our management and administration functions, but that with resourcing more appropriately within the Waters team, we are managing that contract of delivery really, really well.  So the piece of work that we have yet to commence is a more formal sort of benefit realisation, I guess, from all of those things, which I think is worth doing. But it's one of those things that we're pushing back on just at the moment. And I certainly recognise the earlier conversation in terms of workload challenges that many of our teams are facing.  And as much as I think that one's a really cool piece of work to do, anecdotally, I'm not seeing any concerns. So therefore, I think it's a nice to have piece of work. So we just haven't started on that one as yet. So we're in a really exciting phase. As I say, the policy document and our SAMP are the next sort of key bits of work. And we have a timeline such to shape them up that we then moving into early 2022 with our activity management plans, moving through to the next LTPs.  So yeah, that's sort of the report summary and highlights, but yeah, welcome any questions if the committee have any.",

The questions I have is, I noticed that ISO 55,000 Asset Management Standards, and there's also the International Infrastructure Management Manual, that I understand that alignment with those sort of, I don't know, industry standards, I guess, is one of the important goals. And yet I didn't see those, certainly the ISO one,  referenced very much in the policy documents or the project documents, and I wasn't sure how relevant it was.

What does best practice look like? So they've certainly been utilized in that sort of area.  Are they going to change what we do? Yes, but it's going to be different in different activities because we've got different levels of maturity sitting in each of the activities. So in some areas we've got high levels of maturity and they've already a long way down that sort of process of implementing good practice.  In other areas, we're still developing up how we describe our assets and some of our inventory to get a more consistent sort of thing.

I'll move this that we receive it. Could I have a seconder, please? Thank you, Claire. I'll put the motion. All those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Those against?  Carried, thank you very much, appreciate that. Right, I can see we have a couple of guests here, and I suspect they would like us to deal with them quickly, Leon. More importantly, perhaps we could deal with them before we go to our lunch break, because I suspect after dealing with our item on audit fees, Leon,  you folk would be keen to get back to the hard yards of the work that you're doing. So with the leave of the committee, but without a motion, I propose that we just jump ahead  And we go to item 13, which is the audit fees for the current audit and the next year's audit, which is the final two years of the current engagement with Leon. So Ken, could I suggest you lead off and then Leon, very happy to take your comments.",

    "text": " Yes, Chair, very happy to do that. So, yes, look, it's a very brief paper that I put into the agenda just to cover off on the audit fee letter received from Leon and Liz recently in regard to audit fees.  Okay, so, yeah, so look, I guess, yeah, I thought the table that I put there on the first page could be helpful. So these are reasonably significant audit fee increases that we are talking about. So, yeah, compared to the audit fee that was set for last year's audit, 2019-20, a fee of $138,000.  what we're talking about is back-to-back increases of around 8.9%. So, yeah, so fairly significant, but I guess not unexpected, given that there was an additional fee charged last year.  and given that we've actually heard from not only Leon and Liz, but also from the Auditor-General himself about his concerns about under-recovery of fees in the sector. So, no great surprise that Audit is looking for, I guess, what is a correction in the audit fee space.  Their letter also points out significant staff salary type cost increases, and again, no surprise, because COVID, we understand, has turned the world upside down for the auditing profession, and certainly has really impacted on their ability to pull in resourcing from overseas. That has been relied on quite extensively in the past.  So, yeah, so look, yeah, there was a significant amount of the increase that relates to that. We also know exactly how tight the employment market is because we're finding that at Council at the moment as well. So, yeah, so long and short of it is, I guess what you're seeing here is a recommendation from me that we accept these proposed fees. I also refer to the moderation process that I know is used  used by the Auditor-General's Office in terms of setting these fees and making sure there's not outliers. In fact, actually, further to that, I understand that, although Leon can talk to this, I understand that 8.9% is not uncommon. That pretty much is quite a, yeah.  quite a common adjustment within the local government sector. So yeah, so without further ado, officers are saying, look, yeah, let's hear from Leon in terms of this. But I guess what we are recommending is that we get this letter signed, we move ahead with the audit and get the audit complete.",

I raised this last year, and to be honest with you, I can talk about it, but I think Ken has basically said everything I was gonna say. So he summarized it really, really well, and I agree, 8.9% year-on-year is quite high, but it is to drag the audit fees more towards the amount of hours required to do the audit.  So I've spoken in the past also about, you know, how the auditing standards and expectation of audit quality expect us to do more, unfortunately unavoidable. And of course the impact of COVID-19 as Ken said, but I'm not going to repeat everything he said, rather take questions if there are any.",

And not that the committee have heard it, but my advice is, look, we accept this in the way that Ken said, and move on with one proviso.  And that is, Leon, that you have kept us fully informed, kept us in the loop, and as far as we can tell, from our side, received the service. And my argument to Ken was, as long as you keep that up, mate, we won't question the fees. Now, that's me, Bruce Robertson, talking. It's got to be with the rest of the committee, but you can see I've already got a proposer to move that. Thank you, Andrew.  And that really is my key thing. Please keep up the good flow of information. Obviously, we'll be keen to see on the quality, but in terms of actually pressures that are on you when you can deliver, give us early warning, all those sorts of things which are part of service is really, really important. So thank you, Andrew. I've seconded. Is there any other comments either on the motion or indeed any questions of Leon or Ken at this stage?  There being none, I'd like to move to the motion then, please, which is actually double-folded. We should be aware of that. It's actually to obviously, you need to find it, firstly. It's obviously to receive Ken's report, but it's also to authorise Jim to sign the fee letter, or proposal letter, and return that back to Order NZ. So we're accepting this as valid.

That won't impact, sorry, careful wording, Leon. That shouldn't impact on the audit as such, because we've been through this, we've done this before, we can audit remotely. We're also using a really good tool these days that I think you're aware of, which is called Audit Dashboard.  which makes it clear information we require and when it's expected and as it is received. This is not a tool to blame anybody, but to ensure that we are as efficient as we can be both on our side as well as on  So, with that start, what we've done today is our staff will work through what has been received and see, you know, are there any big gaps? Because we can't afford to not be extremely busy and highly efficient. We just don't have the staff. And if we can't complete this audit within the timeframes as set out, we will have to pull out and come back in the next year. Sorry, I'm not threatening.  I'm stating facts and you know me that I'm rather upfront and clear instead of surprising you late in the piece. So that's where we are. I'll keep you posted through Ken, you know, if we have any concerns. So just remind me of when you hope to have the audit done by and be in a position to give a sort of clearance, Leon?
