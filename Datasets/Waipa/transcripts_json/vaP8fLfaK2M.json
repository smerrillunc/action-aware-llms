Welcome members and staff and guests and viewers actually online, which appears we have a few these days. So thank you for joining in. You've all got your agenda before you. I think the first item is, as always, is apologies. I think we're going to enter apologies for Hazel for lateness. She seems to be having problems connecting.  So if we can just note that, other than that, I think we have a full compliment. It looks to be the case. Fantastic. Next item then is disclosures of members' interests. Does anybody have any conflict of interest? Phil, you're waving a hand around.",

    "text": " Morena, Susan, Morena, Councillors, the purpose of this report is to seek the committee's approval to remove the redundant Kihikihi Water Tower on T\u016brata and repurpose the area, which is the town's key vantage point to a viewing, picnicking area where the history of the site can be shared. I'll take the report as read and then only highlight some key points and also talk to the recent correspondence from Angela Brown, who's the secretary  of the Police Cottage Temple House Trust, and also a discussion that I've recently had with Rachel Darmody from Heritage New Zealand. So back when I first started in 2019, a project was initiated by council to start the enhancement of Turata's grazed area to open it up for public access and to improve its amenity for the 2020 Land War commemorations. That included removal of the grazing and associated infrastructure  removal of pest plants, and improvements to the boundary fencing. As part of this work, we commissioned a visual structural assessment of the water tower to determine if we needed to temporarily fence it off to ensure public safety. The assessment, which is included in Appendix 2, confirmed we didn't need to. We then started to think about the long-term future of the tower. The tower was built in 1948 and commissioned in 1951. It's been redundant for some time.  And while it does represent Kihiki's first town water supply, Rachel Darmody from Heritage New Zealand confirmed it wouldn't be protected under heritage legislation. She noted that, as we've said on the report, we will need to follow that standard process of working with archaeologists on the methodology and to apply for Heritage New Zealand authority if there is ground disturbance as part of that removal.  The Reserve Management Plan, which was adopted in 2013, clearly sets the intention to remove the tower. Staff are aware of mixed views in the community about this through discussions with the Police Cottage Temple Trust and the recent LTP process. In light of this, Community Services reviewed three options and they are set out in Appendix 1.  We've concluded that the management plan is still an operative document, and that the high immediate costs of removing the tower are offset by the creation of a destination that will provide panoramic views of Kihiki out to the Waip\u0101's maunga, and also give us the opportunity to share the history of the area. It will also remove a redundant asset, which in the long term may present quite significant costs to retain in situ. The water's team are supportive of this  position that we've reached and have agreed to fund the removal of the tower. The Te Aumutu Community Board and Kiki Rape Hazards and Residents Association are supportive of this option as our mana whenua. The Police Cottage Temple House Trust however are not and have communicated that many of the Main Street business owners that they've contacted are also not. The Trust want the tower retained and are supportive of the Lions Club's proposal to pay for a mural on the tower.  The meeting attendees agreed to request that Council not make a decision yet on the tower's future until a public meeting at Kiiki could be held.  We've considered that request, and we still feel that, given the management plan is still an operative document, it was prepared following two rounds of public consultation, and that there's sufficient information for council to make a decision on this project. So I'll finish there, and happily respond to any questions.",

But that was, you know, adopted in 2013, which is quite a long time ago, actually.

And I was having a chat to Peter the other day, also having a chat to  bill from the iwi, what were their thoughts, and they definitely would like it gone so we can proceed to get the Turata Reserve tidied up and made a much more acceptable entranceway into our little village. And I also recall that years ago it was doomed for destruction anyway when the first assessment of  earthquakes came out and then you may remember that later they reduced those earthquake requirement you know the rules that they'd set out about it so therefore that let because the water tower was to go under those oh sorry oh I'll just get rid of this um sorry but yes it it has been well canvassed throughout the community and the majority of people want it  gone, iwi would like it to go, so we can make a lovely development up there.

    "text": "Cool, excellent. So yeah, obviously the executive summary, we're going to talk about the non-financial and the financial report.  First one, total visitors. Obviously we're up last year. The previous year had a major COVID impact. And we had six weeks worth of the Cambridge Pool opening or the new Peri Aquatic Centre opening in the last of the financial year, which was about 21, just over 21,000 people. So that contributed to it. So obviously our busiest year, but not really a full indication of both facilities operating.  And this is the event center only, total visitors. So we're roughly, obviously, if we look at, I've done three years worth of COVID impact, and we're roughly the year before the same. So, which is kind of nice because we also had some impact of visitors. They obviously would go to the periodic center as well. So we've seen those numbers dwindle a little bit. And obviously, COVID's had a lot of impact on our  Stadium side, so events and just regular community events. So tracking roughly about the year before COVID entered. The pools, so the Livingstone Aquatics at TA Events Centre. Roughly the previous year before those impacts, so we're tracking around the same. Stadium, obviously the last two years  COVID's had a major impact. And so our challenges are around that and gatherings and social distancing. And I've had a number of events impacted as well. So it is frustrating in trying to get them back, but hopefully we won't be too long. And well, I'm in Hamilton, so I'm impacted at the moment. The Club Waip\u0101, so we did quite well with Club Waip\u0101, but that would also help some of the Cambridge people  join the club wiper for the benefits that it gets for them. So tracking pretty well. Group fitness classes were obviously down slightly because once again, COVID has an impact on those and those are the one of the first things to be cancelled due to physical distancing and hygiene and things like that. Peri Aquatic Center. So I did  The final year that we were open for the season, that was a four month period. And you can see with the new facility in the six weeks comparison there, obviously that's 2017 and 18 year compared to the six weeks that we were open. So four months compared to the six weeks.  Swim Waip\u0101, that's been our golden child, I guess, or the highlight. Swim Waip\u0101 has done really well, expanded into the community. Our programs, we got quite a bit of funding, 30 or so thousand to run the Swim for Life and Boat Safety and those type of programs for the community schools. We put through 12, sorry,  3,000, three and a half, just under three and a half thousand through that schools program. And we're quite proud of that, which is up from 2,400 the previous year. So it's up 30% on that in overall, quite a bit through the squads and the learn to swim program. Health and safety. Once again, always a challenge for us.  Being a community facility and the nature of our facility, they're all pretty good. But if you can see, most of the tracking has tracked down. Contaminations are around the same as last year, with an extra six weeks from Cambridge being on and more people. So we were recently, you know, proud of trying to keep them as low as possible and things like that. We had no notifiable event and one ambulance in that period of time.  But most of them are just general first aid bumps, cuts, things like that, locks.",

Feedback, we had good feedback last year, pretty good. Complaints around the same, non-valid complaints, not too much high in suggestions. So I would say the next, the current year that we're in, we'd see a lot of feedback, especially with the peri-aquatic centre opening, and that'll be a different report at the end of the year.  capital renewal, so total we spent about 186,000 just over, maybe to 700 was from Council's capital funding and what the trust has invested back into the facilities that we operate in. Those are just a few of the things that we've done. Additional to that, we did help support with FF&E for Cambridge, so we spent money on that and supporting that to help the facility  get up in operation. Satisfaction survey. We had a good feedback last year. Please note that it is good and Cambridge was not a question in there because it was closed when we did the survey. So we got a CUSTOMS satisfaction index rating of 84 up three points from 81. Which is an excellent result.  And we go quite detailed, so we're asking the nitty gritty. We're not just doing it off a couple of key questions. We actually go down and ask how our services are tracking and what we're applying for and things like that. The financials. So these are the current financials of how we tracked over the last six years. See how we're tracking and then the funding. Obviously there's a big increase in the funding for the last financial year for the Cambridge Pull in operation.  and you can see it down there. So at the bottom there was a net surplus of $867,000. That obviously was left over. Merv normally reports on that, being the accountant, so he normally spins the wheels and can dazzle you with all the figures. And so Merv's little special report that he does every year. Everything in red is the previous financial year.  2019-2020 and see how we track. So. Every area it seems to be up, obviously even expenditures up. But net cost per user is councils covering $4.93 and the trust covering $8.01. And then the annual cost to ratepayers so far for that financial year per ratepayer was $143.69.  and then the equity of what we have, and then what that is giving back to the rate payer of 78.94. And that's the end of my report. Questions?",

I think you should be reporting on those. So rather than just saying what your swim, learn to swim numbers are, I think you should be saying that you're getting these grants or funding support from these other sources, because that's pretty important to us  to know that you're able to make those lessons cheaper or more accessible for a lot of people in our community of children, you know, so that they're getting those skills built up. So I hope you give consideration to that because it's adding more value, you know, to the facilities that you're managing for us.

It's a great design and everyone loves the look and the feel of it. And we're generally getting good feedback around the service that we're providing as well.  There's always the people that are on a negative side towards that, and it's a challenge we just gotta work through. And it is tough when we're still under the building warranties and defects stage in trying to provide a service and reply to them when things are still being negotiated and being sorted out. I guess it's a big challenge for us. So we'll get there, but I'm pretty sure  Waip\u0101 region doesn't go into level three like I am now, that summer will be really good out there in Cambridge and you know we'll be able to use the indoor and outdoor and really get it pumping for the summer period.

And I won't ask you necessarily to provide the right answer now, but I'm guessing in the future, we might need to consider fundraising  to be able to provide, you know, terrace seating.

We do have  portable stackable chairs that are stored away for indoor and possibly outdoor for events. But Sally might not like me saying this, her garden's on the hot spot of maybe getting removed for some tiered seating if we can get that going. Because I know when we've got the school events, just to fit them in will be a challenge. And there's like one row of seating and a little bit on the other side. I know there's a little bit of grass area where they can put some marquees.  But it's all gonna be new to us again, having those events right through the year. And we've got a number of bookings from Auckland Club Swim Clubs for the summer coming for their school camps in January, which we're quite keen to host and they're starting to roll in now provided, once again, COVID doesn't impact too much. But that's a conversation down the track that we're looking to do. The trust is also trying to get a cafe  set up there. That's been a bit of feedback from the public and the trust. We're probably going to look at a two-stage or two-phase period where we get something in temporarily, like a caravan if we can, that provides that service with a cup of coffee and maybe it's something little to eat. And then if that's successful further down, then going to a more permanent site that the trust will do like we did in Te Aumatu, fund that and then get someone in to hopefully  deliver and provide that service, but it's just something that we're working on as we go.",

When you were talking about the seating for the Cambridge pool, could you remember that grandparents and some disabled people actually quite like to come and watch and that some seating be put aside so that we can do that? It's the only thing that if I want to watch the swimming sports, for instance, I've got to climb up the steps and up onto the  in Te Aumutu, up the steps and get up there. And it does preclude, just stops a lot of grandparents being able to enjoy watching their grandchildren swim, which is a great family thing.

One is the swim programme that you folks are running in schools. And just as Clare's alluded to, it's obviously largely grant subsidised for the schools. It's very cheap.  comprising of sort of five lessons and the six ones of water safety, safety lessons. So I know a lot of schools in Cambridge have picked that up and been trying to fit it in. So it's greatly appreciated that service that's been offered. And then the second thing is  I like how you've talked about a two-stage approach to your cafe, so one sort of less capital intensive than the other, I guess, trying to bring a cart sort of on site or somewhere close to site before you sort of look at a permanent solution. I had a resident approach me the other week or two ago about a  a cycle like a, I don't know, it seemed like a tuk-tuk sort of coffee cart thing. And I think she's been engaged with you folks. But, yeah, that concept, I think, is really good in terms of low risk, but provides a service. Eddie Tuiavii You through, Madam Chair.",

And once that's done, we've engaged a third party to lead that expressions of interest and tender process. And we'll advertise that once we get approval, that we can do that on site. One of the things why we've gone to an outside third party is just to make sure that we distance ourselves and the board distance themselves if they know the cafe owners and lead that process so there's no  conflict of interest there. So I don't believe it'll be too long, and then hopefully council will say yes, and then we'll get the tender and that out. Yeah, I think they'll do well in the summer, especially if we have a good summer.",

I've gone to the dark side, team. Yeah, key urban development plan. What a journey this has been on.  You know this this last came to you all in September, 7th of September, we workshopped the public engagement results we had on the UDP and in that workshop I signalled to you that we would be seeking adoption this month. So the purpose of this report is for you guys to recommend up to council that they at that full council meeting at the end of the month  that Kirsty, who has very kindly said she would front my report, that I wrote for it. Hopefully she won't even have to speak, you know, that sort of thing. We could do all the hard yards today. I would just like to touch on a couple of little whoopsies I found in the agenda. And I think it was just when the UDP document was put into the agenda, there must've been something funny with the PDFs, because I noticed on page 73 and 96,  There's some skewiffy images there so please know that that is not what the UDP looks like. I hope you can take comfort that it doesn't look like that. It does actually look, we've got a different image for example on page 73 and it's a lot tidier on page 96 so apologies for that. I will have a chat to our admin and see what might have happened there.  I guess the only other difference, perhaps since you've last seen the UDP, is that we've included an implementation plan. And I know we talked about this in the workshop, because we're really keen to see plans like this, that they don't just sit on a shelf and gather dust. We really want to make sure that communities like Kihikihi get to see some improvements happening. And so that's why we've divided our implementation plan up into  projects that are underway. So it's really easy to go and see what we've already budgeted, what's already happening, what's coming through the pipeline sooner rather than later. Then we've got our short-term projects and our longer-term projects that sit under that. So the projects that are identified in that short-term window in the UDP  they are actually already in the current LTP, so you could reasonably expect them to happen in sort of the next three to five years, whereas those longer-term projects are just sitting a little bit further away. There's obviously always an opportunity to bring those forward through an annual plan process, and we certainly popped a little footnote in the UDP about that for that community. But yeah, that's where things are sitting at the moment, I guess.  I would love to take the report as read and answer any questions you might have.",

There was, however, a word of hesitance or, you know,  concern that perhaps there might be a lot of document writing and perhaps not a lot of action. So I guess we need to make sure that we actually follow through and I'm really pleased to see we have an implementation plan there. I'll probably go so far as to say there was a suggestion that there would be a little bit of a loss of confidence in the process if we actually weren't able to produce results pursuant to this plan  in a timeframe that was kind of meaningful and effective. So yeah, great work. I really look forward to seeing some of the projects roll out in a timely manner for this community in due course. So Hazel, you're happy to move. I'm happy to second.

I hope you're all well. I'm stuck in level three. I'm one of those people that are already on the dark side. This is a report that's seeking the committee's feedback, comments, and or endorsement of a draft submission to the Ministry of the Environment's  proposed changes to the wetlands regulations. The proposals and the submission fall into three sections. The third section relates to consenting pathways with which we're in general support. I'm hoping Tony Quickfall's available to answer any questions that you may have on these proposals. Hilary Webb, our biodiversity planner, is also available to answer any queries on the other two sections.  Now the second section relates to better provisions for the restoration and maintenance of wetlands and biosecurity activities. The submission is supportive of the changes that make it easier to carry out those restoration and biosecurity activities. However, we do seek greater clarity on who is authorized to carry out restoration and maintenance work in wetlands and under what mandate.  because as written, the proposals specify council plans, which gives the potential to exclude documents like EWE management plans. Therefore, in the submission, we seek greater clarity and the ability to work with a wider and more considered range of management plans. The first section of the proposals is concerned with the definition of natural wetland.  Now here the submission does not agree with the proposals, and let me just run through why that's the case. The Resource Management Act, the National Environmental Standard for Freshwater, and the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, in conjunction with the wetland delineation protocols, already provide a clear, sound, legislation-based definition, including pasture  In that definition would introduce confusion ambiguity and lack of clarity in the definition. And it potentially works against landowners by potentially exposing them to the risk of legal action for undertaking management of a site is not actually a natural wetland it's just a vague definition as a as a pasture, so we think that a clear well defined and ambiguous definition of natural wetland.  is beneficial for council in identifying and monitoring significant natural areas, and should it be necessary, hopefully not, but should it be necessary, enforcing compliance with the district plan. So using a combination of vegetation, hydrology and soils produces a good objective technical definition, including pasture,  will make definition to subjective and vague and potentially costly, not just for Council, but for landowners to engage consultants in determining what is and is not a natural wetland. So hopefully that gives some background to where we're coming from. The submission, the draft submission is the appendix to the report. And  We're very happy to take on any comments, answer any questions. I hope my backup team is actually in place.",

I'm actually real pleased about that because if you look at the photographs in the report going on, you can tell what natural wetland and what the vegetation is they're talking about. But what you were saying about prosecution is absolutely correct. You can have, and on my farms, I can have a paddock where the water tends to come to the surface  maybe in the winter, it's full of rushes, it's boggy. Fencing it off is an absolute huge cost. It doesn't have anything like exotic plantings on it.
