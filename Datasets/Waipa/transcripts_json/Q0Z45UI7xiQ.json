    "text": "Would you like to do your presentation at this point? Hi, so I'm Harriet, I'm the manager at Cambridge Community House and I think quite a few know of the house. I've got a few familiar faces in front of me, which is awesome.  I'm gonna tell you a little bit about Cambridge Community House in case there's some things that you don't know. We run the only full wrap service for family and social services in Cambridge for our community. We've been running for 35 years. I've been lucky enough to be the manager for the last 18 months and have really seen a massive increase over that time itself in the number of people and families coming and seeking support from us.  So just had a look at the numbers, being a numbers person myself, I had a look at the numbers and we've actually doubled the number of people, families, the number of people coming and seeking support from Cambridge Community Houses actually doubled over the last four years. That's a huge increase. And yet our funding hasn't increased in line with that. So we're really kind of struggling to make sure that we've got enough funding to provide the services that we need to for Cambridge. And we're also expecting, obviously, population increasing to continue as well.  So we really stand for empowering our community by having a strong and connected community. We're all about, as I said, we have that full wrap service. We are the only one in Cambridge. And we also like to collaborate really strongly with other agencies in Cambridge, such as Salvation Army.  various other churches that run programmes, youth programmes and those kind of things. So, we really do like to tie in closely with other organisations in Cambridge to make sure that the community is getting what they need. So, if somebody comes to us and they need support, we'll see what services we can offer, but also look to the community as well. So, we're really working in tandem with everybody just to get the best for the family that are in need.  We do get some government funding for some of the contracts that we do, alcohol and drug work, we've got family violence, we've got general counselling as well as financial mentoring, but I have to say that the funding that we get from the government doesn't actually cover the salaries for the team, let alone all of the operational costs that go alongside that.  And tonight, I really did want to focus on our financial mentoring service, because that's a service that we use to really provide a lot of that wraparound service for clients. So, we'll have somebody come in, and they may have just been made redundant. Let's face it, we're really all seeing a lot of that happening now with COVID-19, and we're anticipating more once the government subsidy finishes this week and next week. So, we're expecting those numbers to increase.  But we use that service, instead of just providing a budget for somebody on a piece of paper and away they go, we actually walk alongside them. We call it a strength-based service, so we're actually giving them short-term support with, with other needs and that wrap, wrap support, so that might be food, furniture, household goods, bedding, clothing, you name it, we'll, we'll help them with that sort of short-term support, while we get them back on their feet financially. And what we're doing is we're walking alongside them, we're not fixing things for them, but we're walking with them,  talking to creditors and anybody else that we need to, like I said, alongside them so that they have a sense of, of control over their finances. They're learning and they're able to then stand on their feet financially and have that stability going forward. It's very much strength based in that we are, I won't say educating because it's not the right word, but we're enabling them to take control of their financial situation going forward. So, that's kind of what we do with that service and, and we don't get funded for all of the, the wraparound stuff that we do with that service.  And yet that's how we really empower people and see the magic and see the great results that we do. So we will continue to provide that service because it works. And so that's kind of what we're seeking funding for through the discretionary fund is to help us provide that service, to provide staff and my team with more hours to be able to see more people as they're certainly trickling in through the door at the moment. I'm expecting a big impact soon too with COVID-19.  Yeah, I just, I think that's probably all I really want to say at this moment, but there may all be questions and I'd love to hear them. Okay, thank you, Harriet.",

When you submitted the other day to Council, you were looking for about fifty thousand because of the extension, which is great.

And we won't know about your success or otherwise until the end of June. And I'm wondering whether the board should wait until that decision has been made before we consider giving money or $5,000 from the board to the Cambridge Community House. And there's no other reason that I want to see that other than there won't be enough to go around  And if the council is deemed to be successful in getting the 61,000 year after, then it's possibly prudent for us to look at funding some of the other ones who may be missing out. I just don't want to see  people coming in on two different avenues out of the same money pot when someone down the road is very, very deserving.

And, and this, this money that I've asked for from the discretionary fund will make a huge difference. It will-, and it will make a difference now.

I'm from Violence Free WIPA. I'm the coordinator here in Cambridge, and I started in February of this year. So it's been an unusual time with Violence Free WIPA, because as soon as we started having some things that were going to start happening, COVID happened, so everything got shut down.  So we've actually gone about a new way of trying to keep reaching people and keep educating people and raising that awareness through having opening up an Instagram account, linking it with our Facebook website, Twitter, things like that, as well as doing some online activities like we joined in with the Haka against violence, which was all online and it was a competition run from down in Christchurch.  So that was interesting. But basically, violence-free YPAS is really about just kind of getting all the little groups working together so that there's no one silo working.  So that's one prong. And then the next prong is really just about educating and raising awareness. So I've come in, like I said, I'm only for Cambridge. And so I'm trying to do it a little bit differently to make it cater more to Cambridge. We also have another facilitator over in Tiabunu, and it's a completely different community than what we have here.  So we're just, yeah, we're trying to tailor a little bit more. Sorry, I'm rambling a little bit. I'm a little bit nervous. I've never done this before. So forgive me. That's all right, Ruth. Thank you. So what we've actually applied for the funding for this with you guys is actually for the white ribbon. So there's an event in November. I don't know if any of you, I'm sure you've all seen it, where you pass out white ribbons and it's, again, to raise awareness.  Because of everything that's happened this year, we actually have to buy all the things to pass out, like the little white ribbons, balloons, anything like that. Banners, just, yeah. So we have to get all of those things, which we haven't had to do before. So that's what I've put in the application for funding for. Okay.",

    "text": "Yes, you have indeed, Madam Chair. It's Wayne Allen here, so for those that  I think everybody does. I'm the group manager of district growth and regulatory services. So good evening to all of the board tonight. So this is just the quarterly district growth report for the period of 1 January to 31 March this year. It's quite a detailed report and provides a snapshot of the growth and regulatory services related matters arising at national, regional and local levels.  No decision-making required from the committee tonight on this report. It's just primarily for your information purposes and just an opportunity for me to talk to a couple of items throughout the report. Just to make an apology, the report should have been into your agenda for May. It just didn't get into the boards, either Te Amaru or Cambridge boards report. It has gone through the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee agenda.  So they're aware of it. So for those councillors who are on the committee, this was probably just a rehash of what you've heard previously. But I'll try and focus it on the Cambridge side. So Parts 3 and 4, the reporter's information from our strategy team. Part 3 deals with the number of documents released by central government for public submission and which Waip\u0101 Council has lodged submissions on.  not all are related to growth, but just gives you an indication of the sorts of things that are coming through from government and the various documents that are coming through and the submissions that we are responding to from our strategy team. Part four of the report just discusses some of the things that are going on in the sub-regional planning initiatives. So, again, it's mainly from our strategy team in regard to things that are happening at a more of a regional level.  Just want to really focus more on the other sections of the report. Part five of the report provides an update of the strategic planning work undertaken at the local level. So, in particular, the updates of the structure plans for the various growth cells is provided. And of significance, really, here for Cambridge is the work we're doing in the C1, C2 and C3 growth cells. And that's  the new growth areas out to the west of Cambridge. So, just some of the updates here. We've reached agreement with 3M as a significant developer in the C2 growth cell on the intersection treatment between the growth cells C2 and C3. So, C3 is the area by Te Awa, sort of between the town belt out to St. Peter's on the south side of Cambridge Road.  and C2 is the area to the north on the other side of Cambridge Road. So the intersection treatment be a single lane roundabout with a north-south and east-west pedestrian and cycle underpass. But we want to make sure that through our land purchase that we future-proof it for a four-lane roundabout in the future. So design work is underway for that roundabout, for the collector roads that are going into C2, the stormwater swales,  the water supply, pump stations and all of those infrastructural issues. Discharge consent for the stormwater for the C1, 2 and 3 area is expected shortly from the regional council. We've agreed on conditions, so we should have that through very shortly. We're still working with St Peter's on the easements works to get the infrastructure in.  Approval has been given to 3Ms for the development lots. So those are the areas to create for public infrastructure, the reserve areas, the swales, the collector roads, the allotments for the primary school. So that approval with the development lots has been approved and we're expecting a resource consent shortly from 3Ms for their main stage subdivisions and development.  I'll come in with a designation for that primary school in the next few months. So we'll be processing that application. Just moving around a bit to the north of that C1 area, which is we're just still working on the design for the intersection on the Victoria Road opposite Norfolk Drive. So we're still working on the design for the intersection on the Victoria Road opposite Norfolk Drive. So we're still working on the design for the intersection on the Victoria Road opposite Norfolk Drive. So we're still working on the design for the intersection on the Victoria Road opposite Norfolk Drive.  working through expressions of interest on that. Foodstuffs, as I understand, still indicated their desire to establish a supermarket in that C1 area. So, we'll work closely with them once we are to get that intersection and so they can get the road into service that C1 area to develop the supermarket. Cambridge North is the other area of interest. So,  Land purchases have been completed for the northern edge of the Cambridge North to connect up to the northwestern stormwater retention pond. And we're still securing the stormwater discharge, which goes out to the north to the Mangaone out to Hautapu. But there's a lot of interest in the remaining parts of Cambridge North and some exciting developments coming along. So... Wayne, can I just...",

    "text": "Yes, that's a good point.  because they've already got a resource consent for their development. And also there's a building conceded for a childcare facility in there as well. So they're not dependent on the stormwater outcomes as the other remaining parts of C2. So that's why they're ahead of the other developments in C2.  So just moving through on item six is just detailing some of the district plan developments and the implementation. We're looking at promoting a number of district plan changes, primarily looking at some of just removing some of the complexly unnecessary compliance. Some of the rules are not working so well. It's reducing the cost of compliance for some of our customers. So you will be sending through some of those changes through to the board so they can see those as well.  Further in item six, we provide information on resource consents and building consents. So I'm going to try and share a screen here. Hang on a second. So hopefully you can just see this. Some information on building consent applications received and  It's just interesting in terms of the numbers there because, you know, there's been concern about a drop in the numbers of applications that might be received post the lockdown of Level 3 and 4. So interesting in May there, you know, we're back up to 152 applications received. So we're really back to the sort of the average of applications that we're getting.  throughout the course of the year. So, and as we sort of go down, these are the numbers of building consents granted and issued. So, again, in May, 116 applications, building consents were granted for that period. And so when we look at, say, value of building consents, so big  big value there, $43 million worth of applications received in May. Obviously, a reduced amount in April in the lockdown periods, but yeah, there's some significant developments in there. I'll just talk to that shortly. And the value of building consents finalised, so issued, so we issued around $23 million in May, but the team's been working through April, so you can see a big amount of consents that have been issued  So the inspections seem to be, they seem to be fully booked as normal as well. So the team's working pretty busy in terms of doing inspections. So just to have some particular night, you know, we've had some significant developments of building consents lodged. You've got a big trade depot warehouse, 34,000 square metres. That's a huge building. We've got a lot of construction going on. We've got a lot of construction going on.  $24 million. So that's going to be located at Sharp Road next to the Tapito 7 warehouse. There's a new medical centre, Practices and Tenancies at 1913 Cambridge Road. That's next to the Athletics Club there by the Town Belt. $1.5 million. New childcare centres I just mentioned in the Chartwell Investments area at 1896 Cambridge Road. $1.6 billion. Big dollar values. So  That's good for Waip\u0101. You know, on the back of some really disappointing news with the Bunnings closures in our towns of Taumata and Cambridge. So it's good to have resilience there in terms of some of the big investments coming through. And we hope that the investments continue through the course of the year.  I just take that as read for the for the board. So, Madam Chair, that's really the report. And as I say, it's it's really there for just the board to receive. Oh, thank you, Wayne. Really good report, really informative. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",

It's just for your information. No decisions are needed. And hopefully you've all read it and asked lots of questions.  So I'll just highlight a couple of things in it, but not in too much detail. Again, just really the key highlight from the executive summary is the great work, even if I say so myself, my team done during the drought and managing to keep water flowing, particularly in Tiamutu. So that was a huge challenge for us with the lack of water in the stream. So yeah, we did really well to get through there. And then just after we got out of that, we ran into COVID. So it's been a challenging,  six months for us. I think I've only been here seven. So yeah, it's been a whirlwind. So you'll note, during alert level four and alert level three, we only responded to major incidents. We didn't respond to minor complaints or minor leaks. And there wasn't that many, so we haven't had to play catch up too much. See, our treatment plants and reticulation were compliant  for bacteria and protozoa, and reticulation zones were fully compliant for this reporting period. However, we've done some audits and found we missed two samples in July and October, which means that for the year, we'll be non-compliant for the Pucrimu scheme for two missed samples. So that's the rules.  And our procedures are being reviewed to ensure that error doesn't happen again and to make sure we're compliant next time around. And the last bit in the executive summary is the water services team. It says there that the team restructure is planned. So that's been approved by the exec last week. And so we'll be talking to the team next week around the restructure. It's a growth restructure, so there's  up to an increase in eight from 36 to 44 staff. So it's a growth restructure, not a restructure of people losing their jobs. So it's a good news story, not a bad one. Hopefully they'll see it that way.",

So I don't know if you're aware of shared services, but that's an agreement between Hamilton City Council, Waikato District Council and Waipa District Council to deliver our drinking water testing. So they do the samples, the two that were missed, they carry out all the samples and they do all the testing in the lab in Hamilton. And we all pay for that between us, the three councils.  but with Watercare taking over Waikato's water business, Waikato District Council are leaving shared services. So we're just having to review how much they pay for their exit clause and then how much more we'll have to pay each year because there's only two people paying the overheads instead of three. So we're just going through that process at the moment. And I think the last thing was the current and upcoming section 11.  So if you're aware that the Memorandum of Understanding between Council and EWI for the Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant has been signed by Council and I think we're just waiting for EWI to sign it. So that's a huge milestone that's taken a long time and a great deal of work to achieve that. And currently we're starting with stormwater and wastewater networks have been inspected and maintained in readiness for the winter period. So we usually go through and clean out  known trouble areas and get them ready for winter. Okay that's all and happy to answer any questions.",

Obviously, since then, Anzac Day got cancelled because of COVID-19. So we've got $6,495.26 that can be returned to the uncommitted funds  for use, again, for discretionary spending. So if you returned that $6,495, you would have your uncommitted funds would then total $8,801.40, which gives you a little bit more money to use for discretionary grants, et cetera.  At the same time, not at the same time, the Christchurch memorial happened on the 15th of March, and there is unfortunately a little bit of money, extra money needed. In 2019, the board set aside some money to go towards this. Unfortunately, it's not quite enough. There is a shortfall of $171.43 in the budget.  but we do have that money available and uncommitted funds, whether or not you put that extra 6,000 in or not. The sister city's budget, I think you've pretty much covered it already, but we will be going over that again in July, just to give you guys an overview. That budget was originally set before the new community board came on board. So it would be best that we revisit it so that you can have a greater understanding of it.  But like I say, that'll be happening in July. And then of course, I've done a bit of ringing lately, and there is an outstanding, currently outstanding discretionary grants that haven't claimed their money, totaling $5,000. One was $500 for the New Lives Annual Animal Rescue.  and four thousand for the home of cycling and i've heard back from the new animals new lives animal rescue and they'll be sending us a bill very shortly um and i shall have to give home cycling another um call just to see what's happening there um yeah and also uh the board last year purchased memorial medals memorial medals um for  their own display cabinet, as well as to go to, they also went to Cambridge Museum, and we are still waiting an account from them to get that paid off.

Is that correct, with the new financial year?  Does that go over in July? New allocations? So, in my mind, I'm sort of thinking, well, we've got $8,000 now, which is available for somebody, and then in July, next month, when we can say we reconsider this, we'll then have a much bigger pot. But surely we've got some money here that's available, and even if we don't say, we don't feel comfortable with 5,000, surely it would be more valuable for the community, which is the goal, I guess, if we actually said, well, look, here's a portion,  or whatever we think.

I really like the idea of  having a you know one funding round where we give out 80 or 90 percent and if that funding round ends up a few thousand dollars high because we've carried over from this year I think that's that's not a bad outcome and it'll likely come at a relatively appropriate time when when business pressures and therefore family financial pressures are really beginning to bite once the government wage subsidy starts running out and that sort of thing.",

And we need to be aware of what's happening in the community. Some groups are really busy, as we've seen, supporting people in the community. And this  may well be reflected in applications for grants later on in the year so I think we need to be very aware of what's happening in the community so that when we do get the applications for grants we actually do know what's and understand what is happening. So that's really my report for the month. I think we're all tied up with that at the moment.

The previous meeting, there'd been quite a lot of dissatisfaction expressed about the Safer Communities Trust relationship with the civil defense part of council. I'm pleased to report that over the COVID stage four lockdown, that relationship improved remarkably because of the fact that we're working together. And so,  they're trying to sort of maintain that momentum, but that seemed to be a real success. Secondly, they're quite worried about funding like everyone else. No immediate crisis or anything. I've got a few funds in the bank, but, yeah, it's definitely seriously on their radar. That's me. Thanks, Sue. Thank you.",

So the community house were working a lot with people who couldn't do that and helping them get their bills paid and things like that.

She said there wasn't a spike in any family violence stuff within Cambridge, which was different from her Hamilton.  situation but she did say that food was a really big thing within her organisation and again just the Salvation Army working very closely with people  But yeah, just lots of volunteers, a welfare number, an 0800 welfare number that was accessed.
