    "text": "Well, welcome back to the regular Audit and Risk Committee meeting, bearing in mind that we had the extraordinary meeting earlier in the prior month, which was tremendous. Thank you, Ken and Gary, that was very helpful. Look, as Rogers, you said, this is a pretty full agenda.  And I just wonder if I could draw your attention to probably four things that have attracted my eye on this. And obviously, we will devote time to the total agenda. But I couldn't help but get past a very helpful internal audit report on asset management. And I think we would want to devote a fair bit of time to that. Very appreciative of the update on the 2021 annual plan.  And in some sense, it's important for this committee. It's its last chance before Council goes through its processes to consider and presumably adopt that. A very interesting article item here on procurement, particularly the broadening of it for the secondary objectives, which I think is actually really, really important. And also at 1pm, when Leon, our auditor, can join us,  It'll be very interesting to hear from him about developments, not just in terms of where they're at with the audit, and I think they've been doing work and they can, but particularly because, more broadly, the Auditor-General is raising issues  around COVID-19 and their effect on annual reports, which perhaps we may have underestimated at this point. So, I think that would be useful. And I do notice, importantly, in public, we're going to do it first of our deep dives, which will be an interesting experiment and one that I look forward to, to focus on that.  is not to exclude all the other good papers that are on here and the necessary time that we want to give. But I find those particularly valuable. And, of course, we have also Earl, who's online, I think, somewhere I saw him, which is really important for us to hear from him, given what we're talking about COVID-19.  So, with that, I'd just like to fully declare the meeting open. And if I could please move to the preliminaries, which is firstly, I think we've all counted ourselves under agenda item one as being here and present, which is great. Roger, note that from apologies, we'll just record a note that you may dip out at two. Anybody, everybody else here is able to stay here for the rest of the meeting?  Gregor, OK. We'll sustain that, but I don't think we need to actually make a resolution because we just know you'll be out and back. Are there any matters on the agenda that have given rise to concerns around your interests? Yes, Susan.",

Is there any late agenda items I need to be aware of? I haven't been made as far as I'm aware of anything.  All good.

So, can I move then, please, to look at the minutes of our extraordinary meeting on the 12th of May. Are there any matters of comment or correction that need to be noted at this point?  is not.

Well, can I say, having read the minutes closely\u2014great minutes, by the way\u2014and I think anything that, as I went through our programme from last meeting, tend to get picked up in this meeting.

    "text": "Oh great. OK, so if we go to the first slide.  So in summary, our general theme is now that New Zealand's winning the battle against COVID clearly, and hopefully we're going to move to level one at midnight tonight, would be my expectation. So now really the focus is going to switch quite heavily to trying to win the economic impact, so the economic war really. So we've won a battle, but we've still got a pretty big war to go ahead. In relation to the council,  The key influences that we see over the next year or so are probably, you know, there's no doubt that unemployment's going to increase. And tourism and hospitality sectors are going to be the sectors that are going to be most under pressure for this year and into 21-22.  At this stage, the wage subsidies have worked very, very well, and we note on Friday that the government extended that for another eight weeks if your business has lost 40% of its income. So that has been a huge benefit for over probably a million and a half employees, and it's kept a lot of businesses ticking over. So that's been a very positive, but that is going to end, because it's a billion dollars a week, and the government can't afford to keep writing those checks.  that will stop and then we'll start to see really what kind of impact we're going to see on those sectors and what kind of real unemployment we start to see.  Against that background, we would expect household spending to continue under pressure. And despite the best will in the world by the real estate agents to pump up the market, we expect the housing market at best will be tepid. This is a different recession slowdown than we saw in the GFC, for example, which was really financial markets and the banking sector.  and pressures on the housing market were from lack of credit. This is probably going to be a bit of a lack of credit from the banking sector or higher credit criteria, even though the Reserve Bank has loosened some of the requirements. The banks are going to be much more cautious, given they're going to have some pressure on their balance sheets anyway from failing businesses.  And also, I think, you know, the housing sector with unemployment and lower immigration, you tend to get some slowdown. So that's going to be tepid. And so the wealth effect from the housing market is probably not going to be there.  On the positive side, central government is talking about these shovel-ready projects. And as we've got an election in September, you can expect that they're going to rev up the announcements as soon as they can. And Mr. Jones is now standing in Northland, so he'll be wanting to be in the press a lot. So we can expect a bit more money thrown around the place. And that's not a criticism. The government needs to do that. But in relation to Council, it's really  It's really, you know, so these shovel ready projects that affect Waip\u0101, you know, how quick will they actually happen? Because we know, we all know that getting infrastructure projects started and flowing through is not, you can't do it tomorrow, you know, and there's going to be demands on resources for everywhere. And you know, what will the actual council costs be? You know, will central government upfront, you know, expenditure, all that kind of stuff. So while it's going to be a positive,  the timeframe when this flows through is still kind of unclear. So, you know, we're not sure how that's going to affect the council sector. It'll become clearer over coming weeks, hopefully.  The farming sector in general is doing pretty well. Dairy prices are a little bit soft, but there was headlines in the press this morning that Zespri is expecting to do record volumes and they're getting record prices because they're promoting the vitamin C aspects of kiwifruit, and it's taken off in Europe. So they're going to  they're well ahead of where they were this time last year in sales, and they're looking very positive. The meat sector's come back a bit from the heady levels when we had the Chinese demanding meat from anywhere because of their pork problem. And dairy's stable, but there is a bit of a worry around the currency. The New Zealand dollars,  rallied nearly 14% from its lows in March, and that could start to be a headwind. So the currency has recovered all its pre-COVID losses, and commodity prices haven't really come up that much. So the farming sector is looking okay, but at this stage it's hard to see that  really, really give us a massive boost to the economy. So we're sort of balanced there. So government spending and infrastructure spending is going to be a big driver over the next 12 months or so.  Now, the real good news for WIPA is that you have low levels of debt. You're a very low-indebted council. As you increase your debt, you're accessing record low interest rates. For example, you can borrow for most terms out to seven years with an all-up cost of less than 1%. Your rating was reaffirmed at AA minus just last week, so that means that you can access the second lowest level of funding for councils.  So while so that gives you the ability to increase debt.  And in general, your interest expense will probably be lower than what you expected in, well, definitely lower than you expected in the last 10-year plan, and what you're even looking at in the annual plan when we started thinking about that sort of late last year, early this year. So you have got flexibility. From a debt point of view, you're really well-placed. So that gives you the ability to react to a situation if things deteriorate further. And you're in a much better place than a lot of councils, that's for sure.  Okay, so if we go to the next slide, and just any questions as I go through. So this is just a summary. So what it's showing is that we have, for all intents and purposes, won the battle against COVID spread. We haven't had any cases for quite a while. We're not having community transmission. So we look as though we've done a pretty good job.  In Australia, the cases they're seeing in New South Wales and Victoria are almost all because of people returning home and they go into isolation in hotels, obviously. So you would expect that we are going to keep our borders pretty closed except for  except for these bubbles we hopefully start with Australia for example and then maybe later this year or early next year into Asia but it seems crucial that we need to have that quarantine of people coming back to the country for a while yet so that's got ramifications obviously for tourism and the international students and it seems as though while the government's talking about  bringing back international students and having 14 days compulsory quarantine, which they pay for themselves and they can come back, they're talking about the 2021 year. So, you know, so those positive influence of tourism and international students are a little away down the track yet, but, you know, we definitely have flattened the curve. So next slide.  This just shows that we're starting to see activity go back to normal. So what this is, this is, you know, as we all know, our phones know everything we do and follow us everywhere, but it's actually quite handy when you look at information around what the activity levels are. And as you can see, in New Zealand,  we were down nearly 70% in sort of March, April, around workplaces, grocery, pharmacy, retail, and recreation, compared to what you'd normally expect. We're now 16% below where we'd expect to be. So activity is starting to normalize. And we're doing a bit better than places like Singapore, even Australia. Hong Kong and South Korea have obviously averaged about normalized. They were ahead of the curve, obviously, you know, Hong Kong.  and South Korea got their cases in line ahead of us a bit quickly. And then if you look at the next slide, all that's shown is how we compare to Europe and the UK. So as you can see, we're doing okay.  Now in relation to some of the electronic, some of the economic data, consumer confidence has plunged as you can see the first slide on the left there, but it has come back a bit. So you know the index got back to basically where it was in  in the GFC or got worse. Consumer spending hasn't really fallen yet but we'll start to see those numbers fall as we see updated data and we expect that consumer spending will have fallen back towards those GFC levels.  And as you can see with those electronic card spending numbers, it was broad-based. Interestingly, consumables actually improved. So that's the hoarding the toilet paper, rice and flour effect in February, March, big increase in consumables, and then back to normal, whereas all the other guys fell off a cliff, services, durables and consumables, which is kind of not that surprising.  So we did have a massive decrease in consumer spending overall, which obviously has implications for retail and those kind of people. But the interesting thing is that actual savings levels went through the roof.  People, you know, savings levels are up about 10%, so people have actually saved a lot of money because they couldn't spend it. And, you know, maybe people have realized that if you don't buy that three coffees every day, only one, you know, you might actually have to save some money. So that's going to be an interesting dynamic, how that plays out, whether the saving regime continues or whether it was just a one-off, because that will have implications on spend as well and GDP. Okay, the next slide.  If we go to the, yeah, so this is more of the theme showing what's really happening with our export sector. So the yellow line at the first chart is the US dollar price of our basket of commodities that we sell. And as you can see, they have fallen over the last sort of six months or so, but the New Zealand dollar,  until recently was tracking Lara as well. Now you'd expect that to happen. Now there's been a bit of dislocation recently, so we're just talking there are some headwinds we are a little bit worried about. If you look at the top slide on the right,  As you'll see, fruit has held up really well. Like commodity prices, US dollar prices for the fruit we export hasn't really changed. In fact, it's higher than it was probably a year to 18 months ago. Dairy has fallen, which I intimated before. Forestry fell off a cliff because they couldn't actually  they couldn't actually cut down trees, but also there were some problems with Chinese demand for a while earlier this year. That has rebounded, and sheep and beef are just starting to recover from the plunge after the increase in prices from lack of pork in China.  But overall, those prices are okay, but they're not X fruit. They're not telling us that we're going to have a massive export-led recovery in incomes unless the Kiwi dollar stops going up. So the Kiwi dollar is starting to become a little bit of a problem. It's got to 65 cents on Monday night. And it's eight and a half cents higher than the lows we saw in March. So the export sector is gonna help us a bit, but it's not gonna give us a boom.  at this stage. So that means, you know, all things being equal, the economy's still going to find it a little bit tough. World oil prices, you know, as we know, well, not as everybody knows, but the oil price actually went negative in March. That was mainly because there was too much supply and you actually, there wasn't enough storage. So people were actually paying for people to take the physical oil off their hands because they had nowhere to store it.  that's corrected pretty quickly. And the producers have taken about 10 to 15 million barrels a day out of production, so oil's sort of back around that 30 bucks a level. But in the big scheme of things, the oil price is not too far from its lows, so that is having a positive effect on consumer's pockets, because a drop in the oil price  tends to lean to a pretty strong drop in the petrol price, which is like a tax cut for people because you can't sort of escape spending on petrol. Having said that, during COVID, consumption of petrol products collapsed, so it didn't have the impact. You had this massive wealth benefit of people not using their cars at all. And that's gonna be an interesting thing as well. What will happen as we go forward? Will people go back? And I suspect they will. But those lower oil prices are slight positive.  The last one is the Baltic Dry Index. Now this is an interesting one because this is an index of what it costs to buy freight capacity effectively. So the higher the index the more expensive  expensive freighters. And as you can see, leading into the GFC, when there was a huge demand for commodity prices, and there was a big commodity bubble. And at that time, that was when we had a record dairy payout of $8 something, and iron ore was $200 a ton, ratty ratty rah. So  pre-GFC, freight charges were very, very high. They collapsed after the GFC, short term, because there was just no demand for anything. And since then, they've really gone sideways. And one of the reasons for that was there was this big increase in freight charges from 2005 to 2008-9, created a whole lot of demand for construction of ships. And  but like probably office buildings that are coming on stream now, oops, they got their cycles wrong. So there was a lot of extra supply of freight and demand was falling. And as you can see,  People are a bit more confident about the global economy late last year, so you saw freight prices starting to flick up. They're falling back again now. Now, this doesn't reflect what's happening short-term to air freight. Air freight's tripled. Until recently, sending stuff by air was costing three times what it was costing pre-COVID. It's probably down to about double now, as we're starting to see some capacity come back. But that's a direct impact of less flights, et cetera.  Shipping costs are still relatively low, which is good for people like Vest Zespri and the Dairy Board who have charter boats that send their stuff away. But it doesn't reflect the full picture yet, but hopefully those air charges will start to normalize as well.  But that is a concern in general, because with that index low implies demand for global shipping is low. So that means the global trade cycle is actually weak. All things being equal, that index goes up when there's more and more people trading and shipping and there's more demand for boats, right? So while that's a good thing if you're an exporter from a cost point of view, it maybe doesn't reflect a positive outlook for trade. Okay, the next one.  So this puts in perspective where we sit compared to say for Australia, for example, and why our GDP results could be a little bit worse because tourism is a much bigger part of our GDP than most countries. So Australia, it's around sort of three or 4%. In New Zealand, we're above 7%. So we've got a bigger percentage of our GDP linked to tourism than  Vietnam even, Italy, France. But when you look at, you know, and then you get down to Greece, Iceland, very small country, right? So, you know, it gets distorted anyway. Thailand, you know, massive tourism impact on them. And Fiji. So, we are quite dependent on tourism. And when you add those international students to that,  Closing our borders is going to have a bigger impact on us than lots of other countries. So that's why we're just a bit nervous about how things will play out over the next 12 months growth-wise for New Zealand, because that is a big issue. We do get a lot of money from international tourists and obviously students. Okay, the next one.  So this is the New Zealand dollar. So it was sort of going down over the last couple of years in line with really commodity prices drifting off a bit. That arrow is COVID. So as you can see, it fell off a cliff, went from sort of 63 cents down to 56 and a half in a very short space of time. Now, that was done on Friday morning, this chart. It's now closer to 66. So it's even higher this morning. So the New Zealand dollar has recovered all the ground it lost.  before COVID, which is a little bit of a concern because there is a strong correlation historically between New Zealand dollar and commodity prices, because we're a commodity exporter. And when we look at dairy, which is our major commodity export, dairy prices are down 15% over the last 12 months in US dollar terms, and the currency is only down about 3.5% now. So,  the correlation in the last three months has been negative 90%. It's normally about a positive correlation of 80%. So 80% of any move in commodity prices tends to reflect an 80% move in the currency. So commodity prices up, Kiwi up, commodity prices down, Kiwi down, in general. Currently, commodity prices are falling and the Kiwi dollar is soaring. So that's not good news for the farming sector if it continues. So we're keeping a very close eye on that.  And this is all to do with equity buy and risk on and markets starting to factor in a V-shaped recovery internationally. But for New Zealand, that is a basis for a bit of concern going forward. Okay, the next one.  And this just reinforces that. So the blue line is the dairy index. So as you can see, the dairy index, the average over the last couple of years, so the dairy price is below average. And while the Kiwi dollar is well below its average as well, it's now back up at nearly 66. So it's not that far from its average. Again, this was done a few days ago and the Kiwi's gone up another three cents. So the Kiwi dollar is now basically  As we speak, it's around 65.30. So the Kiwi dollar is basically at its average price over the last two years, whereas the dairy price is below average. So while it's not as bad as 2018 when the dairy index was down and the Kiwi was up at sort of 69 cents, that means the payout that Fonterra's indicating for this year is still safe. That is a little bit of a, if that continues, that's a concern. We don't really wanna see that dairy price continue to go down and the Kiwi dollar continue to go up.  you know, that's a negative. And you know, Waipa has got a big dairy exposure, obviously. Okay, next one. Interest rates. So a yield curve is normally positive sloping. That means that short-term interest rates are lower than high-term interest rates because all things being equal, if you give somebody money for 10 years, you probably want to have a bit of a buffer compared to giving it to them for overnight. So in a normal situation, the yield curve is positive anyway. So a positive yield curve doesn't,  itself implied interest rates are going up, it's just the structure of interest rates. But it's quite funny, you know, this is, if we went back three years, these curves would be sort of have a 5% range, we're talking from 0.1 to 0.9. So in the big scheme of things, you know, and if you look at the, so the New Zealand curve, so basically, you know, we've got a cash rate of 0.25,  You've got short-term floating rates around 10 basis points. And then if you go out to borrow for 10 years, these days you're paying about 0.8 of a percent. So it's, you know, it's very cheap to borrow. The problem with low interest rates is that, I mean, you have to have them obviously, you know, the reserve banks had to react to the slowing in the economy by,  decrease in interest rates, but low interest rates haven't really stimulated a huge amount of borrowing and spending over the last few years anyway. And the evidence in Europe with negative interest rates and low interest rates in Japan is that without government intervention, you don't really see a lot, you know, companies aren't borrowing just because interest rates are low. Companies will only borrow if they've got an income accretive opportunity.  You're not going to borrow money at 0.8 if you're going to lose money on the investment, right? You've got to have positive investment outcomes. And at the moment, you know, looking for those is going to be a bit difficult. So that's why, you know, talk of negative interest rates, we really see that as almost like desperation because interest rates themselves aren't going to deliver growth.  they help sort of people get in trouble financially but they don't know and that's why government intervention and this infrastructure spending is going to be very important in the short term at least because I think the corporate sector is still very nervous about  spending CapEx. And in fact, what we've seen over the last three months, we've probably had about four billion of CapEx cancelled. You know, Auckland Airport's one of our clients and, you know, they've cancelled two billion of CapEx straight away. So they've, you know, and I'm not telling you any secrets, this is public knowledge, you know, they've probably written out checks for $150 million to get out of contracts to build stuff, because it's cheaper to do that than actually continue on. The second runway at Auckland Airport's probably 15, 20 years away again.  So that was going to be starting next year. And then you've got people like, you know, the Vectors of the World and, you know, Chorus. Chorus has got almost done in rolling out the broadband. Guys like Enable and Christchurch are doing the fiber in Christchurch. They're almost done with their infrastructure. The generators, you know, power demand is flat, so they're not building, you know, building new stuff. So those big infrastructure spends have probably been deferred anyway.  And councils are deferring expenditure because Auckland's gonna have to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars worth of projects because it's broke, basically, in the short term. It's got a big cash flow issue. So that's the thing that's gonna have to happen is who's gonna come up and sort of take up that infrastructure slack? And it's probably gonna have to be central government and councils because the corporate sector, I think, aren't gonna be really doing it in general.  And low interest rates don't per se just lead to more demand. There's other factors at play there. Okay, next one. What this really shows is, guess what's been happening since the last 15 years, guys? Interest rates have been going lower. This is just a continuation of a long-term trend. And if you look at COVID, that move in COVID,  You know, we had the big fall in the GFC in 2008, but interest rates have really been going lower for a long time. And this is all about GDP growth globally is weakening. Normal levels of GDP growth have got lower than they were historically, and inflation outcomes have been generally low. So, you know, there's a lot of arguments now that interest rates, we had about 20 or 30 years of artificially high interest rates,  And the real level of interest rates is somewhere around these kind of levels. Now, COVID's pushed them down to extremely low levels, but there is an argument that we had, from the 70s, the oil shocks, all those kind of things, we had artificially high interest rates, and now we're going back to a normal situation. I think 200 years in the UK or something, between the 17th and 18th centuries or something, inflation was zero for about 200 years. The price of butter and bread didn't go up for 200 years.  Inflation is kind of a 20th century thing. So, you know, while interest rates are low, the trend hasn't really changed. So, you know, we've been saying lower for longer. We actually didn't think they were going this low. But, you know, this is an expectation of interest rates massively increasing anytime soon is kind of a bit overdone, we think. But having said that, at zero, there's probably only one way to go in the short term, a little bit higher.  Forget about COVID, the trend in interest rates has been lower for a long period of time and there's other things driving that. Aging population in the West as well, lack of demand. Okay, next one.  What this shows is, which was a potential impact on the council, was that when COVID first came out, the credit margins blew out. So for example, let's say the LGFA could borrow at a margin of 0.3 of a percent, it was suddenly paying a 1% margin. Now, if your base rate's gone down by 1%, but your margin goes up by 1%, your interest rate expense hasn't changed. In fact, it could go up.  Luckily, the Reserve Bank's intervention in the bond market, it's been heavily buying government bonds and local authority bonds, has pushed those margins back down to sort of normal levels, despite the fall in base rates. So that means net-net, the cost of borrowing for the council has dropped quite substantially, because you've had no increase in your margin from pre-COVID, but you've got much lower base rates. So that's a positive story.  So we got this, and that just shows how much of an impact the Reserve Bank's intervention has had on margins. So they got out to 1.2% for these A-rated bonds, and they're back down at 0.6. So they doubled for a few weeks. So that's a positive story, because if you're not gonna have to borrow more, your borrowing costs have come down in real terms. Okay, the next one.  These are just, you know, these are a whole lot of activity numbers which show that they're weakening. But the good thing about all these is that they seem to be starting to flick up. So while it's a long way away yet, at least we've stopped falling. So that's a, and this is, you know, your construction sector and export sales and investment tensions.  while they're bloody weak, they've stopped falling. So that's just a few little green shoots of hope at this stage, but we need a lot more evidence yet. Okay, the next one. And this is what the Reserve Bank's been doing, getting back to those lower spreads. So,  There's the, at the moment, they're talking about buying 55 billion of bonds over the next 12 months, and they're kind of ahead of the game so far. So at the moment, they're front-loading their purchases a little bit. Obviously, in the first few weeks, they started off. They may slow down down the track as things stabilize. But the expectation is that the Reserve Bank will increase their purchase levels from 55 billion to 90 billion.  So what that actually means is the government's going to issue about, let's say, $150 billion, $140 billion worth of bonds over the next few years to fund its deficits.  the Reserve Bank is going to buy 90 billion of those. So a lot of that extra bond supply is effectively being bought by the Reserve Bank, which means that the Reserve Bank is effectively expanding the money supply by that amount. So there's a lot of liquidity coming into the system via this. So the government is actually injecting money into the economies. And that's one of the reasons why you're seeing equity markets  be so strong, because if interest rates are zero, where do you put your money? And people put them in equities. But the Reserve Bank is a big player in the bond market at the moment. They also buy an LGFA bond. So when you go and borrow off the LGFA, the LGFA has got the backstop that if people didn't want to buy the bonds for whatever reason, the Reserve Bank's there to buy them for them. So you're always, so you've got no funding issues. The council sector is very well placed if it needs to borrow.  And this graph excludes the LGFA and inflation-linked bonds, but that's another eight billion or something they're borrowing as well. Okay, next one. And as you can see, we are quite busy. The Reserve Bank is looking to buy about bonds that are gonna total about 5% of GDP.  Australia is only looking around about 2%. The Federal Reserve is up at about 10%. So massive stimulation in the US. The Federal Reserve is buying everything. In Japan, the Bank of Japan now owns more than a third of all Japanese shares.  In the US, they're buying unrated bonds as well. Here in New Zealand, they're only buying government bonds, LGFA bonds, and the same in Australia. But in the US, they're buying corporate bonds, big capital, big liquid injection. So as you can see, if things deteriorate, we've still got a fair bit of headroom for the Reserve Bank to be active before we get near the kind of levels we've seen in Europe and the US.  You know, what we're doing is kind of normal these days. You know, who would have thought we'd say, you know, a year ago that the Reserve Bank buying $90 billion worth of bonds is just normal activity in the New Zealand bond market, but it is in these circumstances. So, you know, we're not, New Zealand's not an outlier, that's for sure. Okay, next one. This was the,  initial reaction to COVID in the US. So one week, 6,800,000 people lost their jobs. Next week, 6.6.  It's been falling quite steadily. And last week we had a doozy. Over May, the U.S. created, so the U.S. had lost 30 million jobs up to the end of April. And unemployment had gone up to about, whatever it was, 39% or something, or 13% or whatever the number was. I think about 9%. And it was expected to hit 19.8% at the end of May. So unemployment in the U.S. was expected to be close to 20%.  Now, in actual fact, and they were expected to lose 8 million jobs over May. In fact, the US gained 2.5 million jobs over May, and the unemployment rate edged up to 13.3%, which is a shocker, but it's a lot better than it was.  In actual fact, a lot of people went, so the opening of the US economy, a lot of people are going back to work. So that was a $10 million turnaround from what markets expected. Markets expected 8 million jobs lost, they got over 2 million gained. So indications are, the US is a very interesting economy. It's got very, very strong labor flexibility. They can lay you off today and get you back tomorrow with no real economic impact.  So unlike here, if you make somebody redundant or get rid of them, you know, then coming back is kind of doesn't happen for a long time because it's a big decision to do that. In the U.S. you furlough somebody straight away, you're out, and then a week later you're back. So the U.S. employment market can actually improve quite quickly. And again, we're starting to see signs of that U.S. economy is starting to fire up again. And obviously there's a bit of self-interest out of the White House because the last thing  Donald Trump wants is for the economy to be tanking when he's got an election coming up in November. So there's a lot of, you know, and there's been about two trillion worth of stimulus in the US. But again, we're starting to see some slightly positive stuff out of the US economy, which is good for global growth. Okay, next one.  And this is, again, so this is the S&P 500 index. So it fell from 3,400 to 2,200, so that's about a 30-odd percent decline. Last night it closed, on Friday it closed around 3,200, so it's now about, it's basically almost recovered, it's recovered almost all its pre-COVID, its COVID losses.  So the S&P 500 equity index is almost back to where it was, and it's basically flat for this year. So back at the start of the year, it was round about 3.2, and that's where it is now. The NASDAQ, the tech one, which has Apple and all those kind of guys in it, actually hit new all-time highs on Friday. So equity markets in the US are implying that we are going to have a V-shaped recovery.  you know, the economy's weakened sharply and it's going to bounce back really sharply. Now there's arguments, people have been arguing about, is it a U-shaped recovery? Is it a W? All this kind of stuff. Is it a hockey stick where we just go sideways? Well, equity markets and currency markets are really saying, we're going to come out of this pretty quickly. Now,  The New Zealand economy, I think, you know, we have got some issues in having a V recovery because as I said, tourism and those kinds of things are going to be weak for a while. But, you know, and this is kind of, you know, our equity market's just going up because interest rates are so low, you know.  there's no other alternative or fear of missing outs driving these flows. But not everybody buying equities is stupid. So equity markets and currency markets are forward looking. And they're starting to imply pretty strongly that the markets are factoring in a pretty solid recovery. So it's getting very interesting. And if that's the case, things here will be a lot better, a lot quicker than what we're currently pricing in.  You know, equity markets have had a stunning run. If you're lucky enough to buy some shares at the bottom, you've made a lot of money, but I doubt if many people tried to catch that sort of falling knife at that time. Okay, the next one. That's it.  So the executive summary was basically, you know, we've got a bit of a long, hard road, you know, New Zealand's got a few issues, but there's some pretty interesting signs happening out there and, you know, maybe we're gonna bounce back a lot quicker than we thought. So, you know, we're gonna have to be flexible over the next few months, that's for sure. Appreciate that, Earl, that's very, very insightful.",

As you say, we don't need to be rushed into action, which we may be less certain on than if we had a bit more fullness of time, because you say the cost of making the best decision actually is high relative to the interest rate or perceived movement in interest rates going forward. We don't want to be like Tarawanga that had to abandon $90 million on a parking building they cocked up.  Yeah, exactly. And we aren't in any way stretched like them, or as you've seen in the Herald today, Auckland, with the level of savings it's got to try and find to balance.

I suspect, because Australia's done this until the end of September, we will probably get another extension.  Because I think that, you know, we won't have the bubble going yet by, you know, when is it gonna be sort of July, end of July, early August. And those hospitality and tourism industries are gonna be under pressure still. So I think for the sake of spending a few billion in the big scheme of things to try and maintain those jobs and businesses, I think we may get another extension. But it's getting to the stage now where  if you've had about four or five months of these subsidies, and that's the only thing that's keeping you surviving, at some stage the government's got to say, you know, what's the risk reward of doing this?

Just firstly, but coincidentally, I would argue that we are in a strong financial position because we have rated our ratepayers at an appropriate level in the past, whereas a lot of councils have not. But that's an aside, really. I guess, I just want to make a comment. In my other life, I'm a retailer of durables in Te Aumutu. And so, we were closed for,  seven weeks, and of course had no income at all. But since we've opened, business has been really good. And I guess, you know, there's a bit of built up demand that we are benefiting from. I kind of would have expected that to have slowed by now, and it has, but it's still well above normal levels.  So, you know, yes, it's bound to hit a wall in the not-too-distant futures, but just a comment that in our local economy, it has been much, much stronger than I thought it would be.

I know I asked about building consents, and the email reads, outside of the Christmas period, we usually receive 140 to 160 applications a month. There was a fall in April with level four restrictions, but May was back to 152 received. Similar trend in the planning space.  inspector's schedules for existing consents are largely full. So, that's a real strong indicator that, I mean, it's just one month, but  looking in a reasonably good place, I think.",

So, you know, anecdotally on the Great Old Republic of Waiheke, you know, my wife was unlucky enough to open a cafe six weeks before COVID. But  Turnover's down 20% from, you know, and they, you know, the first month they were open, they were, because she's partnered with somebody who's really well known on the island, so they were busy as hell as people rediscovered it, because she hadn't been there for a year. But they're only down 20%, and, you know, it's looking pretty good. And we've got no international tourists, obviously. The winter's a bit quieter anyway, but yeah, and you talk to people, in general terms, there does seem to be  a desire by New Zealanders to try and support local businesses and sort of do stuff. You know, like a friend was saying, they know the people who own the Duke of Marlborough and the Bay of Islands and they opened up the weekend and they were flat out. So there does seem to be a little bit going on and if we can get those, you know, the Kiwi stabilised and those export sectors to do a bit better, you know, it's  It's not all doom and gloom, that's for sure. But there is an underlying concern. We need to see the global recovery speed up. But yeah, it may not be as dire as we all thought.

The initial planning work for the response was based on the business continuity work undertaken last year and that provided a really good base, so it was a good foundation to work from. In addition, since the report was written, the Southern Waikato Emergency Operating Centre based in Taupo has been closed.  Key learnings were that we used pragmatic planning that enabled us to execute plans and focus on the most critical tasks and resources, particularly the essential services. The right people on CMT to make decisions, including the exec is necessary with those involved taking ownership. Communications internal and external importance could not be underestimated.  We planned based on what we knew and then flexed as more information came to hand rather than waiting. The can-do attitude of staff meant success and it was a whole of organisation response. Last week we deactivated CMT. We'll continue to monitor, particularly if there was a need to escalate again.  and we will complete an action after review and use the feedback to finalise our generic crisis management plan and update the pandemic plan. We currently have a staff survey out to understand how we can improve our crisis response but also to give input into what Council's new norm may look like.  I guess everyone's talking about it's not business as usual, we're going back to it's business as new. And as at 9 o'clock this morning we had 59.4% of staff had completed that survey. It's a really good response rate and it's open for another week. We have set up a COVID improvement group and it's endorsed the terms of reference  And this is to capture and embed positive changes made during the crisis, ideas for improvement and how we can work in the future. So that's the actual risk management update. And then we've got the quarterly risk report, which I'll talk about as well.  I wonder if I could just jump in there, Jenny.",

They've just absolutely driven that process of being continually focused on business continuity during these really difficult times, and in terms of displaying great leadership, in terms of the rollout of the digital technology and making decisions at the right time, etc.  I mean, clearly, they haven't done the work alone.

So I think the important issue is probably is picking up on this is we've really dodged a bullet from a human health perspective. The economy is going to suffer a bit and we've got to work on that.

I guess the report is to give us, say, one reference in terms of what our risk profile is looking like for the organisation. We've retained, you can see, a watching brief on top risks one and two.  and these have been further emphasised by the impacts of COVID. And you can see it's reflected in the emerging risks on page two as well. So there are reports on those two areas and a further deep dive later on in the agenda. So there'll be an opportunity, I guess, to discuss those in more detail. But I just wanted to highlight those. Since the last report two, we've also put a watch and brief on risks four and eight.  four from the perspective of we've obviously had to mobilize our workforce and they're still largely mobilized and this has become a bit of a worldwide thing we are more open to cyber security threats now and we have experienced a lot of phishing emails over the last little while so we're just putting that on a watching brief and you can see there we have put a comment in around the last quarter and we've had one breach I think  and there's some proactive training that's going to be occurring across the organisation just to help mitigate that. In terms of the watch and brief on top risk, that comes with the financial sustainability, and that's obviously been discussed quite a lot as a result of Earl's presentation, but also will be discussed further as you talk through the LTP and the annual plan reports as well.  And the watching briefs, I guess, are also reinforced by the additional mitigants we put around these top risks. There's largely been timing delays from COVID, not necessarily that we're not going to be doing those mitigants, but we've just had to divert resources into other areas. We are undertaking a review of council's strategic internal priorities at the moment.  That'll be completed by the end of June. And then come July, we will be looking to workshop these top risks with AHRQ staff and KPMG. So we'll do a complete refresh and review of these top risks, which under the current circumstances may shift them a little bit. You can see also that we're trying to get the compliance reporting underway. So we're starting to fill in gaps in there.  Obviously, again, our resources have been a little bit diverted, but the compliance risk function is now going to be coordinated under the BIRM team. So we're hoping to make some more progress over that over the next sort of three to six months.",

We have activity management plans in place for all those activities of the council that are required to have them.  We were concerned as to the stage of completion to inform the development of business cases for the 2021-31 long-term plan. However, through reporting to the governance group and with the input of the group manager service delivery, we were satisfied that they had progressed to a point where the front end of those plans could inform the development of business cases.  So there have been actions identified and these have been incorporated into a work program. The group manager service delivery is leading a group to oversee that further work and we are anticipating that that will be completed by the end of September 2020. So there are mitigations that have been put in place to ensure that sufficient work has been completed to inform dependent work streams.",

And so there wasn't a great strategic or front end context to that. So what you're seeing is quite a  a change of approach especially as we look to be a strategy-led organisation where we've got a lot more future thinking under these asset management plans so whilst the plans comply statutorily with where we needed to be looking at best practice we actually need to start factoring a lot more of what the future looks like and so that I think is the paradigm shift that we're heading for here and one which I'm very happy with.",

Now I still need to meet with DB Lascelles and the team because the project is still very much alive in my mind, notwithstanding that we may not be able to build bricks and mortar. We're still able to tell those stories and particularly in partnership with Iwi, given the capital investment we've made in  in the application that folks use on their cell phone.

And so when I came into this role, I was really equally as pleased to hear that this audit was underway.  As you'll have seen in the audit report, there are a number of recommendations and certainly opportunities for improvement identified. And I'm going to be taking a lead role in developing a roadmap and how Waip\u0101 District Council responds to these challenges.  because we're all very aware that there are significant benefits that can be attained from adopting really good asset management planning processes, albeit we do have a number in place already and those are also outlined in the report.  As Gary and Kirsty mentioned earlier, you know, WIPOWER is already very well respected for its strategic and growth planning. We've adopted very strong project risk management frameworks and alongside this we have a very robust organisational risk management framework.  However, I think that the opportunity really is about how those things link back into how we manage and plan our infrastructure. And it's that response and that connectedness that is often missing. So as we've also already talked about coming into the next long term plan, we've shaped up our business cases for future capital investment. And we are confident that they are appropriately responding to our current organisational strategic framework.  even though those asset or activity management plans are not fully completed. But to be fair, that's not unusual as there are often iterative processes as we ensure that our strategic framework is right. And then particularly so in this particular cycle when we've had a global pandemic to sort of challenge some of our future assumptions as well.  So looking forward, where we need to focus is, as I say, not so much on the plans, the documents, but on our asset management planning and so very much around our systems and our processes which form those required linkages from our strategic frameworks through to our levels of service and then into our appropriate infrastructure management responses.

So there were areas of improvement though clearly requiring attention and our overall assessment of the WIPO DC asset management planning sort of system of controls  we pitched as a developing area, so that's against a four-point scale where we have good, effective, developing and not effective. We also identified six overall areas of recommendation, four which we consider to be high-risk areas,  High risk areas are those that are fundamental and require an urgent attention, two which were medium risk and we consider to be important and should be addressed as soon as possible as well. I think the overall, you've seen that the issues that we've raised, I'm happy to talk to any of those points as individuals would like to explore them further, but  I think what I would say is that the combination of some of those findings do create a potential for conditions where significant failures are possible and surprises are possible within the overall infrastructure for the council area and the consequence on service delivery. There's also a consequence for harm to people  the environment and the economy, if any of those sort of significant failure events were to happen. And there were observations of near misses, I guess, which could have been different, given a different, slightly different set of circumstances. So, yep, there is certainly room for improvement.  I just sort of caught the last detail of the the risk session as well and just the question around those improvement management and I think one of the other important findings from the asset management review is that continuous improvement framework as well. So  In years gone by, I think there is perhaps not been the evidence that continuous improvement has been achieved, that there has been good completion of some of the improvement actions that have been noted by Council and others. So, there are really important areas there just to change and make sure that the outcome is different in this period going forwards.  and there were absences in particular which have some of which have been addressed already regarding the leadership absence of policy that's fully endorsed some of the strategic direction documents and I think also the challenge of resources at times resource shortages and churn and key staff positions as well. So without any sort of significant change in how you address those challenges  there's the risk that you could be further stepping backwards and less and there is more effort to step forwards. So yeah look I mean I think that's the  great aspiration within the council. I think we clearly recognise that a lot of it is predicated on growth of course which is a concern prior to the Covid emergence and making sure that there's a really good foundation for asset management to undertake that planning of investment  and to realise the benefits of growth and to acknowledge the challenges that it throws up as well, does require a very good foundational asset management base. And so that's never more important than now, obviously, post COVID. So, yeah, some work to do.",

And subsequent to that, they created a centre of excellence within Hamilton City.  to start responding to the challenges that they were facing. They're a team of three people, but what they do is they have created a virtual team of the people who sit down within the activities to support and enable them to implement good activity management within the operational teams.  So I think that in terms of building our roadmap, understanding our improvements, we may need a little bit more resource. But I think it's more about how do we make sure that the people who are, I guess, closest to the activity management processes  are well supported and so I think it's it's that's the model that I think has some real merit and what I'm anticipating is being a rollout and I don't think it should be resource hungry. I guess then there may well be a need but then maybe that's more around prioritization and timing than just bringing on resource but yeah as I say I'm  I'm certainly not advocating at the moment that we rush out and take on additional resource at this stage until we get a better understanding of where our effort is best placed.",

Yeah, but I just got the sense that it's a bit more than simply giving people, I suppose, clearer direction and maybe access to really good information. I think, and in a way it might be a symptom of the growth that Andrew's touched on too, that really we've moved to another place, you know,  before maybe those roles did have time to do asset management when they weren't busy with other things.

I'm thinking of the Hotapu one, yeah, because  I have heard other planners, like an Auckland planner, saying that they want to ban private plan changes. I guess private plan changes just disrupt the whole very careful and long term processes that have been put in place to bring to fruition certain expansions of whether it's residential or industrial activity.  is this business of different growth cells coming on or completely new ones being put forward, is that in itself the problem, that we should actually be much firmer in protecting those really long-term preparations that we've already got in place, yeah, so that we're not going to have, yeah, I suppose some nasty surprises around the corner because we're trying to, you know,  cater to the needs of these people that are wanting to progress something much, you know, urgently or, you know, a completely new project.

And so notwithstanding that we do a lot of work planning for growth, the strategy around that and the way in which growth ought to be accommodated and sequence of time, all those sorts of issues don't make their way through into the activity management plans. And so this is,  I think of the solution being in two areas. One is the culture, people managing these activities needing to find these documents useful and to date there's a sense that we need to get through our annual audit cycle, let's get the asset management plans in a state where they can comply.  Fundamentally, I think the people managing the assets don't find these documents useful, and that's a major education issue for us. So for me, there's a significant issue around leadership and culture. And to that end, you know, Dawn has a passion for asset or activity management planning, and this has to start at the executive table and filter its way through into all those areas of the council.",

So I think there are some major quick wins to be had by having a front piece in all of these activity management plans around the things that we pull down from Future Proof, WIPA 2050, and the visioning work we're currently doing with the LTP.

    "text": " Through you, Chair, take it that this report is read. You'll recall that in May, through our extraordinary meeting of this committee, I was requested to provide an update prior to the revised draft annual plan being presented to the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee meeting. Just a couple of things in the executive summary.  identified that the financials referred to within the report are still being finalised. So, there are some financials that I would like to highlight changes to, if that's acceptable to the committee. So, just in terms of the process that has been undertaken. So, we talked last time about a comprehensive review of the draft annual plan that was out for public consultation and  May, March and April, and that review being led by the executive team, but impacting on staff across the whole of the council, looking at operating expenditure, capital expenditure, the capital works programme and revenue. So, when we last met, provided updates to the key assumptions that underpin the annual  Since then, we've received submissions and the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee on the 26th and 27th of May heard submissions. 11 submissions were presented verbally from the 42 that we received. In terms of the section entitled Overview of the Revised 2020 Annual Plan, there is a table that summarises key financials and the changes that I would like to draw your attention to  are the operating expenditure. So, the revised annual plan figure has changed and that is now 95.95 million. And that's a result of last minute changes that have been made as a result of submissions received to the annual plan and through the work that's been undertaken by our finance team. So, just moving on then  The other changes that have been made relate to the interest rate. So, this relates to the interest savings on borrowing. So, this is in relation to the key drivers. So, the revised work or revision work that's been undertaken leads us with a headline rates increase, proposed rates increase of 2.4%. That remains unchanged.  But in relation to that heading, the drivers for change, we talk about the growth, the impact on rates, and interest savings on borrowing. So that percentage, we talk about that changing from 2.5% to 1.5%. That revised figure is actually sitting at 1.8%, and that's the finalised weighted average interest that has been confirmed by the finance team.  The dollar amount, though, that represents the saving remains unchanged at $810,000. Just with regard to process. So, in this report, we do signal that the revised draft annual plan will be presented to the SP&P Committee on the 17th of June. That date has changed due to a cancellation of the Service Delivery Committee meeting. So, the report and  revised draft annual plan will now be presented to this committee, to SPMP, on the 16th of June, so that's next Tuesday. With regard to the assessment against legislative requirements, so I outlined there the number of considerations that are required to be taken into account in determining whether  we meet our statutory requirements, comply with policies, and, in fact, whether there is any significant and material change that requires further engagement with the public. And we refer there to external legal advice having been obtained from Simpson Gresin. In essence, that advice concludes that there is nothing that prevents us from setting rates, that there is no change required to our revenue and financing policy,  And in fact, the revision work that has been undertaken and where we've landed in terms of those targets and not specifically meeting those as set out in the revenue and financing policy, all of that work has been undertaken in response to COVID-19 and in response to the public submissions that we've received through the annual plan process. So I'm happy to respond to any questions, but I think that's probably enough coverage for the report itself.",

Could you give us an idea of where that eventuated from and  There's no proposal to put that into the rating formula. It's more that it's going to be retained. And I think it's quite a large amount to be retained. Yeah, so I'd just like to understand a bit more about the thinking about that. I mean, what's given is that, you know, we're in a very uncertain environment and it'd be prudent to just keep the whole lot in reserve in case we need it. I think that's what...  I can talk to the reasoning for retaining that, but perhaps, Ken, you might also like to assist and talk to how we've arrived at a cash surplus.",

However, you heard earlier today from Earl White and the information that he shared and the thinking that he provided  is different from what was provided back in March, things are looking a little more positive. And so, yes, the recommendation has been and is at this point in time to retain that cash surplus to provide a buffer, given the uncertainty that we have in terms of at the point that the borders open up, whether there will be further restrictions imposed  on the nation, that impact on us here at Waipa in terms of the economy, the environment, the risks imposed in terms of public health.

    "text": " Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Thank you, Kirsty, and through the Chair. Hey, look, I think that probably the most important thing that I just want to say is that in regard to that cash surplus of 1.165,700, so of course, actually, that is not at this very moment real. So, yes, you do just need to bear that in mind as well. So, Kirsty was talking about the uncertainties during the annual  plan period, which I totally agree with. We have got uncertainty during the annual plan period, but we also do have some uncertainty on that $1.165 million. That, at this stage, is an estimated position that's come out of an exercise that happened over the last month or two in terms of managers re-forecasting their budgets for the current year that we're still in.  Yeah, that said, I mean, yeah, that said, I would hope that we wouldn't be too far off the mark, and so therefore I would hope that we would still have a fairly significant cash surplus. But, yeah, but I do need to reinforce that, yeah, it may not be exactly of that order.  Yeah, look, the other thing is, so yeah, so look, I think we do face a great deal of uncertainty in regard to the LTP. So I realise that the key focus of this report is obviously on the annual plan, and obviously next Tuesday you take the annual plan another step forward closer to completion. But look, I do believe that the LTP  will really pose some challenges for us. And, of course, there's still a huge amount of work that we need to get through before we actually start shaping up those figures. I can recall, for other LTPs past, that at this stage of the proceedings, sort of a year in front of actually adopting the LTP, we have been sitting on cash surpluses of probably a reasonably similar size.  and those cash surpluses had been very, very useful in terms of smoothing the rate-par effect in the first year, the second year, and perhaps even the third year of the LTP in terms of our ability to utilise that cash surplus to take some pressure off rates and avoid some very big headline numbers.  you'll be aware that the number that our ratepayers look most at is that headline number. In the case of the annual plan, 2.4%. It's a little bit crude being totally focused on that number, but that is the number that our ratepayers are  are focused on, and of course that is a year-to-year number. So for instance, if we chart all of this cash surplus into reducing our 2.4% lower, what that will naturally do is the year after, i.e. the first year of the LTP, the headline number in that year is going to be a lot greater because we have  potentially, you could argue, artificially reduce the amount of the number in the annual plan there. So while we do very much adopt a philosophy at Waipara, I mean, we're very, very conscious of where that cash surplus has come from.  It has come from our ratepayers, and while our philosophy very much is to give the benefit of that money back to our ratepayers as soon as possible, I would argue, and this has certainly been our practice at Waip\u0101 for a number of years, that at times it can take a year or two  before the benefit of that money goes back directly to the ratepayers in the form of a lower rate increase. And I would argue that that's for pretty good reason. Now, I just wonder, and again with the Chair's indulgence, yes, Sarah, I think you are probably better placed than me right now. You're probably more over the detail.  in terms of, I mean, was there a question from the Councillor in regard to how we arrived at the 1.165? Yeah, Sarah, could you just talk just a little bit to the really key drivers in achieving that? Because Councillor St-Pierre, I guess it was a little bit of a surprise to me and to the wider executive team, actually, that we did have a cash surplus of that order.  because, yeah, before that re-forecast had been done, we were actually quite concerned that, you know, there may not actually be a positive number there at all. So, yeah, so it certainly was a surprise, but, yeah, Sarah will just be able to talk to us about a little bit of what's actually in there.",

So in terms of the totality of the operation, it isn't actually that big a buffer. 1% move in our costs, perhaps contract rates, whatever, and that would disappear.

Yeah, a strategy that we have to be mindful of the rates increases going over more than one year, and that there's a lot of uncertainty when we have an LTP about how big those increases will be, especially in the first three years.

And point two,  would necessitate measures like redundancies and effectively reduce Council's ability to perform going forward. So, you know, there's just that point. I do totally take Ken and Sarah's point in regard to the actual quantum of the cash surplus. It's certainly something yet to be  found out, and as Ken says, it's not really until the accounts are reduced and, I suppose, audited that we really know exactly what it is. Yeah. And, Roger, just regarding your point on the arbitrage fund, I totally agree with you that be it arbitrage or cash surplus, it's taxpayer\u2014sorry, ratepayers' money, and we totally have to bear that in mind when we decide what we're doing with it.",

I think this question of arbitrage and how much of a cushion do we build in for the uncertainty of the future? When we talked about arbitrage, we said that the possibility was that we would protect all or some of that as a cushion  for uncertainty in the future. And yet we're now looking at another 1.16, again, adding to that cushion. And then, of course, there is the future possibility, although we can't say what the interest rates are going to be, but future arbitrage that might eventuate. I'm just wondering, how far do we need to go to build a cushion into next year's rating model?",

    "text": " Bruce could I, or Chia could I respond to that?  Councillor Gordon, I think you just need to be aware that in regard to the Arbitrage Fund, which obviously a fairly significant balance has built up on that over the last two or three years, I think you just need to be conscious that we will be bringing a report to the meeting next Tuesday  indicating that that arbitrage fund would be the major source of funding for any recovery effort. So, yes, what we've got here is the arbitrage fund being dedicated towards\u2014 you know, this is subject to a decision of the elected members\u2014  But certainly the officer recommendation is that the arbitrage fund would be focused on recovery. That will be a bucket of funds, if you like, that could assist with that, whereas the cash surplus is effectively the retained buffer, or at least retained during the course of the annual plan year. We're looking to make that available for rates relief in the outing.  going forward. So, yeah, so that's effectively what the officer recommendation is in regard to the two funds. In regard to the two arbitrage possibilities going forward, because you have just alluded to that just in the last few moments as well, look, right now, yeah, arbitrage opportunities going forward are quite restricted.  We did try to do some arbitrage deals a few weeks ago, and we weren't actually able to achieve the funding to be able to do that. There were quite significant concerns about the liquidity at the time, and we couldn't actually raise that funding from our normal sources.  So, yeah, so, yeah, so, I mean, liquidity, as you heard from Earl White this morning, the liquidity situation has improved, and that tends to be a fairly temporary nature. But I think that we are quite mindful that in the current times, yeah, and particularly shifts in the interest rates, yeah, that we may not be able to achieve quite so much on the arbitrage fund as what we have been able to in the last two or three years.  And certainly, as the level of Council's debt increases over the next two or three years, again, there will be far less opportunity to achieve arbitrage returns. So, look, we've enjoyed it while we're able.  We did create quite a significant bucket of money for the benefit of the ratepayer. But unfortunately, as these things always are, sometimes the good times can't last forever. And I think that's very true in regard to the arbitrage deals that we've done over the last few years.",

And that is that  We're aware that the Crown will be coming up with various incentives for work-related projects through the year, and it will be useful, I think, if Council is aware of a small buffer that may be available, because some of these projects are going to require some funding on the part of the Council.  And so, by way of example, there are walking and cycling initiatives out there at the moment which require Council to find 10 percent of the money in the Crown, 90 percent. And so, in order to leverage those, we will need to find money from somewhere. So, it's an example of  A, we're not certain of how much money we're gonna have in the cash surplus, but B, to the extent that we're pretty confident we'll have one, useful to tuck that aside for A, year one of the LTP and B, leveraging any projects that we might need to take advantage of as they come available, but it's important for the council to know that that money's there.",

Very little of it comes as free lunch. In other words, we've got to be able to react.  OK, that's cool. So that then gets me to the very important section. I'm glad you did go to the significant lengths, Kirsty, of explaining, I think, the other thing that should interest this committee, which is that you've gone through a consultation. Obviously, what is going to Council next week is a recommended position. The critical question is, have we met our compliance requirements in terms of the Local Government Act and is Council capable of making a  decision without being challenged on the Local Government Act basis. And so I think that's important. It certainly makes sense to me. And you have, shall we say, boilerplated it with the Simpson-Greaves report, particularly around the revenue and financing policy.  which was what originally attracted my attention when reading through this report, I got to the funding mix. So that's really helpful. We are, from a risk perspective, shouldn't feel comfortable that with a finalised paper for next Tuesday, Council's in the best position to make a decision.  to have that in a piece of paper. Are there any other questions at this stage? I feel like I'd like to draw the discussion to a conclusion, although I want to say, and I'm comfortable to move the motion that we received the report, is that there are no further questions at this stage. So, if there are no further questions at this stage, I'll move the motion.  It is our chance, our last chance to say anything to Council as a risk committee. I think what we in receiving this, we are agreeing with this. It might be, Sarah, there's some more that you'd put around the cash surplus because it may be a debating point next time and you're a week further down the track tend to knowing quite where it might land.  But otherwise, we're saying, as far as we can see, all matters have been taken into account in terms of both process of delivering this for the 16th and also in terms of core risks around assumptions. So, look, I would like to move that we receive this report. Do I have a seconder, please? I have not seen hands waving, but I heard a noise. Sorry, was that you, Clare?",

    "text": " Yes, absolutely. Right. So this is an update on the improvement programme in relations to the two internal audits that were done a while ago by KPMG. I'm going to take it as read and just highlight a couple of the key points and then take any questions. So Council, along with other councils, received a letter from the Office of the Auditor General recently.  The letter follows a visit that was done by the OAG to all of the councils, and they interviewed a number of staff from each of those councils. Their focus was obviously on procurement. What they were looking for was to try and see where there were any gaps in procurement and councils, and also to get a bit of an idea of the capability and capacity that exists within local councils. So that report has come through.  And it's come through with an article which poses a series of questions for all of the councils to consider and to help them get an idea of where their procurement is at within each of their councils. It looks at the practice and the culture that exists within all of the councils. So there's some key points there. The first one focuses on good governance, actually.  There's some really good questions there that we will need to sit down and have a look at for Waip\u0101. It talks about planning for our significant capital projects. It talks about conflicts of interest, which I think I've already raised with this committee before. It talks about emergency procurement. So that's quite timely to be looking at that and how we've gone through that in the recent pandemic.  And then it starts asking, sort of diving a bit deeper into the councils around their own procurement capability and capacity and asks us to look at some really good questions there internally and also around our policies and training. The contract management side of things as well. How are we doing with that? And then  on to achieving broader outcomes through procurement. So that's sort of asking the council, so how are you taking account of those broader outcomes that have been brought through with MBIE's procurement rules? So that's quite timely in terms of the strategy, which is the next paper I'll be talking to you about. So my plan with that and to respond to that was to put a series of questions out to council.  to staff and to collate that response and take that response back to Exec. And that will then come through to Audit and Risk Committee as well. So you'll get an idea of what our review, based on those questions, what those answers actually look like.  and what that actually highlights in council, if there's anything there that we need to be looking at. The next thing that we'll be looking at is KPMG are coming back in to do a review of the last professional services panel.  So that's going to focus on looking at the effectiveness of the end-to-end process that we have for procurement using the PSP. And they're going to look at it from the 1st of August last year through to the end of March this year. So that means that they're actually taking into account the new panel because that, of course, was all reviewed last year.  Their focus is actually on the processes that we use, the management of conflicts of interest around the PSP, how we go in terms of our delegation compliance when we're using and engaging the PSP, and our payment process around the PSP.  The time frame for that, so that should kick off early July. They'll come through and they'll do some checking throughout a number of teams within council because the PSP is fairly widely used within council. And they'll issue us a final report, which I'll bring back to the 14th of September ARC meeting so that you'll get to see the outcome of that review. And if there's anything we need to look at in terms of that.  The contracts module, so that is coming along quite nicely. We've had a little bit of a delay because of COVID that has meant that we haven't been able to do the user testing we were hoping to have done, but we're planning to kick that off very shortly. It's looking pretty good from the testing that the project manager and myself have done. So hoping to get that out fairly soon.  As part of doing the testing, we've been advised that there is a version upgrade to the module that we're putting in, and that will mean that when that version upgrade comes in place, it will really assist in terms of the construction contracts, because they have a separate, or a more complex, shall we say, payment process that needs to be managed, and we should be able to run that through the contract management system as well.  We've done a review of the regional framework. You'll recall that WIPA signed up to the regional framework with other LAS councils. So we've done a review of that to align those principles to the MB broader outcomes, because they hadn't really taken account of those in our framework. So those broader outcomes now feed through into that framework and our policy and principles document.  I recently held a workshop with council a few weeks ago around the procurement strategy, and that will be coming through on my next report. So in terms of the work programme and the actions that are left, the main impacts will come from the implementation of the contract management system and the requirement to have purchase orders for all contracts. Those two items are quite closely linked.  And we just need to do a wee bit of a tidy up of the categorisation system. There's a list of a few suppliers which don't have categories assigned, and so that makes it a little bit difficult to do that supplier monitoring. And without the contract management system, I can't clearly see which suppliers are on purchase orders and which are actually on contracts. So once we get those three things done, it will make getting those last few  actions easier to tidy off. And I'm hoping, as I think you see in those dates there, most of those by December this year, hoping to get most of that cleaned off at that point. So did anyone have any questions around any of the outstanding actions that are left there?",

And it's mentioned that not many councils actively discuss with suppliers upcoming works.  and ways of reducing any barriers. Yeah. So are you able to give us an assurance that, you know, you're aware of that, that you're wanting to be able to somehow build in a system so that we will be able to have, you know, we know that that's going to happen. So hopefully we maximise that participation.",

So for the local suppliers, he can have those conversations around what do they see as the barriers to being able to get work from council.  In terms of the larger contracts, of course, we can always do the early contractor engagement and get some idea from them of how they think it might be easier for them to engage with us.

    "text": "Sure.  So this was workshopped a few weeks ago with Council, and now I'm just bringing this to the Audit and Risk Committee to invite any feedback. I'm going to take it as read and we'll just do a very quick summary and then open it up for feedback. OK, so.  We talk at the start about the broader outcomes, and I mentioned it in the previous report, broader outcomes brought in as part of the government procurement rules, and they cover social and economic, cultural and environmental well-beings, and incorporate that into how we make our procurement decisions. This strategy is a way of bringing those broader outcomes into Council, but also is here to  recognise the current environment that we're in. Sorry, there was a bit of interference there. So the strategy is going to be used to provide direction to staff when they're going to procure goods or services and to take into account the principles that are set out within this document.  The strategy is intended to be a live document. So we know and we've talked about this morning how it's a pretty fast changing environment. And so we're not saying that this is fixed and signed off forever. It will be reviewed and we have the ability to make some changes to it if we think that that's appropriate.  It's designed to make sure that when we do our procurement, we align that procurement to council's vision and the community outcomes. It introduces three principles to apply when we're doing our procurement. And so that is the first one is to make the best use of every dollar. The second is to consider potential for local contribution. And the third is to include sustainability measures. And as I say, these are  it's a way of aligning our procurement with those broader outcomes. The broader outcomes of government, which I keep talking about, but the broader outcomes of government are compulsory for government agencies and are expected for local councils. I believe that may change and so  This is helping us to front foot that implementation of those broader outcomes. And I think it's kind of just the right thing to do anyway. So.  If we look at those principles, the first one is making the best use of every dollar. And that means that we'll spend some time reviewing our processes to make sure that they are the most efficient and appropriate for the procurement that we're doing. So if we're doing something that's fairly simple and straightforward, we don't want to make it too onerous, as Clem's talking about before. We don't want to make it too onerous for our suppliers to actually participate in our procurement. So we're going to do a check and just make sure that  the processes and requirements that we have in place are appropriate for the type of procurement that we're doing. And we're also going to look at, make sure that we're looking at public values. So we're not just focusing on that short term lowest price received. That's the one we go with. What we're actually going to make sure that we're doing is looking at that total cost of ownership and the whole of life costs associated with the procurement that we're doing. So it's not that quick fix.  It's the longer term picture that we take into account when we're making those procurement decisions. Principle two is around considering local contribution. And I know this is probably the one that most people will have the greatest deal of interest in. But what we're trying to do here is create some opportunities so that if local suppliers aren't participating in potentially the procurement itself that they have,  ability to feed into that. So what I mean by that is if we're doing a big construction project, it's probably out of the size for a local business. We can engage a business from outside of Waip\u0101, but we're going to ask them some hard questions around what they're actually going to contribute to the Waip\u0101 community and economy by us awarding them this procurement opportunity.  So that might be in terms of are you going to be engaging any apprentices from within Waip\u0101? Are you going to be using local manufacturers? Are you going to be leasing premises within Waip\u0101 while you're working in our area? Those types of things. So we want to get a handle on.  OK, you're coming from Auckland. What are you actually doing in Waip\u0101? And what are you giving us as a part of us giving you this opportunity? And by putting that into our tenders, that makes those suppliers much more conscious of the fact that they need to be seen to be doing something and to be demonstrating that they're doing something. So it just it changes their focus slightly.  to see what can we actually do for Waip\u0101 while we're there, essentially. And when we talk about local, we're going to use or look at the definition of a supplier of goods or services that maintains a workforce whose usual place of residency, that is where they normally live, sleep and eat, is located in the Waip\u0101 district boundary.  So we're not saying because you've got a postal address in Hamilton, you're out. What we're saying is you've got a postal address in Hamilton. How many of your employees actually live within the Waiap\u0101 constituency? They're going to be working on this project.  because when I've looked at our list of suppliers, and particularly when it comes to those larger construction ones, they have a postal address which is not in Waip\u0101, but actually most of the workforce is actually based in Waip\u0101. So under this definition, they would be considered local as long as they were maintaining that workforce within our community. And if they've got that workforce in our community, then those people are paying rates,  They're going to the supermarket, they're going to Mitre 10, their kids are going to school in Waipa and they're participating in the sports clubs and contributing that way. So we'll look at that as part of our tendering process, that there'll be some requirements that they'll need to demonstrate as part of their tender.  of how they're contributing to WIPA. We're also going to look at a classification system that we're going to run across our different types of procurement that we do. So we've got three different classes there. One that's always local. So those are the sorts of things that by their very nature we just should be buying locally.  Then there's the ones that have the potential to be local. So that's where local suppliers have the necessary skills and experience, but potentially be getting better value by going outside of Waip\u0101.  but that's where that kick-in will come in of what are you actually contributing to Waip\u0101 when we bring you in. And then we have to recognise that there are some\u2014 there's some procurement there that it just doesn't make sense to be doing that locally. And by that, I mean an example of that would be our IT software, for example.  there wouldn't be somebody in Waip\u0101 who develops a TEC1 system. So it just doesn't make sense to be doing that externally. Principle three is around being sustainable. And so sustainability doesn't just mean the environmental stuff either, that also  looks at, for example, having a code of conduct in place to make sure that the suppliers that we have are following good employment and health and safety practices and being prepared to sign up to that. Because at the moment, we don't have a supply code of conduct.  That's something that government have introduced for all of their suppliers, and they are required to sign up for that. And I don't see why that wouldn't be appropriate for any of our Waip\u0101 Council suppliers for us to ask that question and ask them to commit to doing that. We're going to look at engaging with M\u0101ori businesses. At the moment, we don't actually have any sense of how many of those businesses are there  community or what they're actually able to deliver to us. The same with the social enterprises. I know that there are social enterprises within Waip\u0101, but I don't know an awful lot about them. I think we engage with a couple of them, but potentially we could be actually engaging with more of the social enterprises in Waip\u0101 and helping them. And that's spending our  our ratepayer money still within my power as well. Then you look at the environmental sustainability practices, asking our suppliers to demonstrate some of that. And that might be things like for construction projects. Tell us how much of your construction waste is going to landfill. Tell us how you're going to reuse some of that construction waste. Tell us if you're going to be doing any recycling as part of the project.  So if we don't ask the questions, we don't actually know what's going on. So until we start including that in our tender templates and assessing our suppliers on that, there's no need for them to demonstrate any of that. But if they can see that we are asking and that that is actually making a difference in how we do our assessment of who we're actually going to award our contracts to, then they'll see it's worthwhile making an effort in all of those areas.  And at the end there, I've got some SMART goals. So that's a group of goals that the team will work through that and just see what we can actually implement. Some of them we've already started. The 10-day payment for purchase orders has already been implemented. And so we're turning the invoicing and payment around really quickly to try and get that money back out. So we're not waiting for the 20th of the month.  We get the invoice done, we get the purchase order receipted and we get the money paid out so that we can keep that going. And that is actually, that's something that we put in place and we've had some really good feedback from the local suppliers about that. They have really appreciated that.  So that's essentially the strategy. It's gone to exec. They were fairly comfortable with it, but did want me to bring it to this committee and give this committee some opportunity to provide some feedback. I've got an internal work group of staff who will work through and figure out what are the actions we need to do to implement these. What are the ones that are the quick ones that we can just get done?  And what are the things that we actually need to spend a little bit more time on just to make sure that they're right. But as I said previously, I want to get this done as soon as we possibly can to enable it to start making a difference. So were there any questions?",

The questions I had was, I used as a reference the sustainable procurement and government that the Sustainable Business Network has put out and they... Please. Yeah, you're familiar with it? Yes. Yeah, so they take a different approach or that the case studies they quoted took a different approach to working with the supply chain.  where rather than asking what you're going to do they sort of have a questionnaire to see whether or not they sort of were already doing practices to maybe get above a certain threshold to make them eligible or I suppose people that didn't get above that minimum threshold weren't considered. So I'm thinking it might have been done to make it a bit less arduous you know in the detail that's provided because this is another thing I'm concerned about that I mean I'm totally for sustainability  but you don't want to make it so difficult, you know, for the people that are putting in tenders. So I'm just checking if you're comfortable with the approach that you're advocating for WIPA, which is more an open way. I suppose maybe you think you've got to give people the biggest chance to demonstrate any form of sustainability rather than being too prescriptive, I guess. Yeah.",

Not quite so easy for some of those smaller ones. So I think we've really got to think through how we do that.  So the process that you've talked about there is like a pre-qualification, and that might be something that we put in place for those larger procurements, so make it really scalable. So we certainly could consider a pre-qual process on sustainability for those larger procurements. That's an option, absolutely. Okay, now that sounds great.",

The main one being that we've checked with our future proof partners around the population projections that they're gonna use for their LTPs.  and Hamilton City are going to use the same NIDIA data that we're using, but we've agreed that we would like that reviewed in light of the pandemic. So I've approached NIDIA and the University of Waikato to produce an interim data set so we can expect to receive that in the coming months. It will essentially just account for changes in migration with the borders being closed and what that might mean for our growth population projections, whether that means it will  Will it totally change with the decrease in international migration or will there be other changes to think about because living in  the wipeout might become more attractive if people can work remotely and that kind of thing. So we can expect to receive that in the coming months. And the other actions are that, yes, we've got business cases. They were due at the end of May. So we have 244 sitting there, which accounts for north of a billion dollars of spending or council investment.  and the other key action is that the LTP working group is coming together this week to review to give a full review of the risk the project risk register which we will then take up to up to the project governance group for their input and then we will circulate that back around to this committee so just check in that you guys can still hear me because i see i'm getting some messages saying i'm freezing yep i yep i can hear um but through you uh",

So when we looked at selecting NIDIA to support, especially the work that we did in future proof earlier, it was because of what they call the stochastic models they use. So there are some assumptions that can't be precisely predicted.  and they run a whole number of variations of the models and end up at a midpoint and they can give you some probability around either side of those midpoints. Technically, it's a very sound approach to looking at statistics and demography, but we'll get you some background on that, Claire. I'm very comfortable that they are one of the better modelers when it comes to  population change and things like migration.",

There's lots of anecdotal feedback out there from the community about the things that they'd like to see  in their communities, especially  with the lockdown period and then coming out of periods where they might have done a lot more walking and cycling and those sorts of things. And so I think we've got to be really strong on process when it comes to consulting with the community and come into this thing with very much an open mind. But critically, we're sitting now on a significant number of business cases with something north of a billion dollars worth of capital spend over the next 10 years.  and I don't want to assume that those capital works and projects are all still appropriate. I think what we need to do is to spend some time, develop a very very good spatial plan before we start allocating money out of that quantum so that you know in 10 years time we'd look back and think  Yeah, we've done a good job and we've built the type of communities that people expect. So I think the big risk in this project is that we don't follow a robust process and just slow up a little bit and give us time to develop the sorts of communities that our people are after.",

So this year, as you'll see, although we had planned to do the roading revaluation due to having done that last year,  We completed two fair value assessments, which show increases in the order of 1.4 percent over the entire group.  So that's pretty immaterial, and we won't be doing revaluations this year. Obviously, the fair value assessments note the uncertainty in the market at the moment, but both of them are pretty happy with where everything's ended up, and they are confident in the values.  Then I did list all the database improvements we have done. Obviously, because we aren't hitting re-evaluation this year, they don't come off until our next re-evaluation. But we have made good progress there. So I think that's really all I wanted to point out. And I'll obviously take any questions. All right.",

Thank heavens local councils didn't have to do it because you do deliver critical services. I mean, not everyone remember that all the roads and water and water supply and water sewage and all that has actually been done by councils.  As far as the annual report is concerned, and that's where I think the biggest impact is going to be from my perspective as your external auditor, the work done in the previous piece on the accounting policies is great and it's good to see council Sarah and her team being so all over this.  But one of the things that we'll have to look at is, of course, the impact of COVID-19 on, for instance, revaluations, which you don't have at the moment, only the value assessments. Will that have a further impact also on the impairment of assets, where assets either are not used or cannot be used?  What about service performance? Are there areas where levels of service has dropped because of the impact of COVID-19?  the council receiving any grants and how that should be accounted for. And then of course, the spending of that money, because they're linked to certain specific criteria of why the money was granted and how it would be spent. Those are the areas that I'm concerned about going into. And I've used the word concerned very, very seldom, especially with council as well.

Those are the areas that we'll look at. So if you, unfortunately, I couldn't find you published a tertiary report and annual report at the moment.  But if you, once it's available, look at one of the universities and or even the polytechnics, and you'll see that they had a disclosure note in the annual report talking about the possible impact of COVID-19. Now, this is a month or so ago when these things were signed and what we did in response is add an emphasis of matter paragraph just referring to that disclosure, which was rather vague.  I believe that for any June year ends, which will be your council as well, we would expect more disclosure. We would expect a formal assessment. We will share with you what we want, obviously, through Ken and Sarah. And then we will have to work through all of that, which will obviously mean quite a bit of extra work for us as well.

Just two other points that I can quickly mention. The Auditor General is talking to Treasury, DIA and MB about a possible move of statutory deadlines. Now, this is not easy because it has to be approved by cabinet.  but there is a possibility that the statutory deadlines will be moved purely because we need to, as public sector auditors, well, auditing on behalf of the Auditor General, he needs to prioritise which audits he can actually complete. Now, of course, the significant ones from his perspective is the financial statements of government to give other entities and overseas  readers of the financial statements of government comfort that, you know, the audit has been completed and what is in the annual report or the financial statements are actually fair and reasonable. Then on the other hand, he has to focus on entities on the NZX  because that could impact business confidence and of course the financial markets themselves. So we may, and I've mentioned this previously, and then I said it wasn't a big risk as far as I'm concerned, it is a bigger risk now that we may end up with having to decide which entities' audits will be completed and which one will have to be completed later than the statutory deadline.  And I think that's about as far as I should talk. I'd rather take any questions if required.",

So we're pushing really hard to try and push that up. And as far as LTPs are concerned, because you can't, I can't see doing an LTP without an audited financial statements of the previous year.

So I'm just really kind of picking on the key points for the capital works program. So just to acknowledge that the report takes you up to the period ending of the 30th of April.  There's currently 173 projects that are being tracked. You will see, if you refer back to your previous report, that there has been a reduction in projects. That reduction of projects are mainly due to growth projects, and they have been deferred into 2021 years and 2022-23 years. And really, that's a reflection of where the developer is sitting. So that is where those projects have been deferred.  So, the forecast, the re-forecast at the moment is sitting at 90.9 million and that does take into account some deferral of the projects associated with the COVID-19 impact of the contracts. So, that's why you've got a reduction sitting in regard to that re-forecast figure and I say down to 90.9 million. So, of that 90.9 million, we have got 69% of the budget spent.  So that's 62 million, and we've just got under 29% of that budget committed, which is another 26 million. So if you combine them together, taking into account some rounding errors, you're sitting between 97 to 98% of the budget fully committed or spent by the end of 30th of April. So that's probably the best track record we've had to date. And so that represents 88 million of that  approximately 91 million. We have a balance of approximately 2.4 million and that balance is really associated with land purchases associated with growth. So we either have an agreement in place and we're just waiting for the signatures to come through in regard to the land purchases or we're still in negotiations with those land owners to complete those purchases. So  that may or may not be spent and so there's a potential if it's not spent it will be carried forward into next year but we really can't determine that depending on how those land negotiations go so that's the balance. So that's kind of where we're sitting in regard to the dollars and the projects. Any questions on that before I move into the CE KPIs? I'll throw you",

You need to hit it next year because you've got an increase in capital works coming next year, that's for sure.  And moving, if there's no further questions, moving forward into the CA KPIs, just a reminder that the KPIs are tracked against the annual plan budget, not the reforecasted budget. So at the time already in the report, in the end of the 30th of April, we had 74% of the renewals  So basically that's on target to be met by the end of the year. We've got 63% of the level of service, and we should make that. We've had a bit of delays in some of the level of service contracts, so we may just fall underneath that. And look, the biggest issue we have is the growth. So it's sitting at 41%. We will wrap up a couple of more contracts and projects, but we will not hit that target. And that's probably a reflection of the deferral.  and deferrals that we've already done through this year. So again, the targets tracked against the annual plan, not the reforecasted budget. So that will not hit the 70% aspect, but that's due to those projects being deferred. So that's the main component of that report. Any questions?",

It's a terrible word, but is this as you would expect it or is there a particular feature of the two? I think if you kind of look at that far right pie chart, that project tracking,",

So whilst all the dollars are there, the dollars are against the reforecast in regard to COVID-19. But what that is reflecting is that there's quite a number of projects that are now have got program delays, and they're going to be finished in 2021. So at this time of the year, I would not be expecting to have projects  So many projects in a behind mode or slightly delayed mode. And that's the COVID-19. So that is what's showing on that. Plus, I would have also expected to have more projects complete. So we've got 19 kind of projects, contracts complete. Again, that has been hit by the COVID-19. We had quite a few projects that were winding up.  when COVID-19 hit us and of course they all stopped and I restarted again. So that's the impact of the project tracking. And then that follows through all of it where you'll see the untracked, the slightly delayed, lower complete. And as I say, we've got a couple of projects on hold and those projects on hold are the growth projects.  as well. So, whilst they're on hold, there is still some work in the background, but in regard to, you know, either design work or construction work, they're not happening. So, that is an element of that.",

I think we're now moving ourselves into public excluded. We've got a resolution there. I think we just need to note, perhaps, Sam, you could just check for me, please. But we also just need to note that part of what is subject to this is actually adoption of the last or the 12th of May public excluded minutes as well. If you could, if I could leave it in your hands to appropriately  I would be grateful. All the reasons are there. They're fairly logical. I certainly didn't have any concerns with it. So, I'd like to move that for the reasons that are all laid out in this resolution that we move into public consideration. Could I have a seconder, please? Councillor GRIFFITHS Second, Bruce. Thank you. Is there any discussion on the motion? No. In that case, I'll put it. All those in favour, please say aye. Councillors say aye. Those against? Right. Now,",
