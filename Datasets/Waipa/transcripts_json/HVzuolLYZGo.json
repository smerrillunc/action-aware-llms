So now we are back in the live stream public part of the meeting, and we have, I think, seven applications to consider. So what we usually do is we just go through briefly each one and give a sort of a pulse check on what your feelings are, work out how much you'd like  you think might be allocated, and then once we get to the end, we do a check on how much funding we've got, and then we might have to do an adjustment. Does that sound okay? Let me try that. Okay, so the first one up is Pirongi Golf Club. And so they're applying for $9,000 for their driveway reseal. Yeah, and you can see that they're demonstrating really great support from their community and things like that.  What's some comments from the members on how far we should support their application? 1,500. 1,500, okay.",
