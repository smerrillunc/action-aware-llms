And I think... That's exactly my thinking, Chair. And I think we've got to be very careful on that one. I would hate to see that happen. And I think we also need just a wee reminder that once upon a time our town had a Carnegie library. And the reason that  it was taken that the title of Carnegie was taken away was because we started charging for books a long time ago and that's what there are very few and that's just one of the things the origin of most of New Zealand's library services is actually because of the Carnegie library system and I would hate to see that that long tradition  know I'd like to see it reinstated but we can't do that it's too late we've moved out of the building we started charging fees but I just think we you know the intention was always with the public library that it be a free service.

But it's just so good to see that because the roads are quieter, people feel it's a bit safer, so they're all on their bikes. So that's really where the focus we thought had to be was actually making the streets, once all the cars come back, making the streets or bike paths or protected cycle paths safer so that people  you know, can travel a little bit more economically, because I think a lot of people are going to be trying to do that going forward. So, but yeah, I'm happy with what we've got. Like I said, we could have gone on and on, but I think what we've got is probably where we're at.",
