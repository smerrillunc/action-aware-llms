    "text": "Wayne? Right, good morning, Your Worship, and good morning to councillors. So this is a pretty straightforward report to you.  to reflect a resolution made by the Waikato Civil Defence and Emergency Management Group Joint Committee. So the Waikato Joint Committee revisited the topic of controller appointments and delegations in response to the state of national emergency for the COVID-19 event. It was decided that all local controllers and their alternates  would be elevated to a tier two status in the Waikato group, which means that a local controller can operate in any local authority area as part of their EOC within the Waikato group. Now, such a move was seemed essential to ensure that there was sustainability and adequate coverage as a group  given the health risks inherent in the current COVID-19 climate. Fortunately, none of the Western Waikato local controllers have fallen ill to COVID-19, so there has not been a need to secure additional local controllers for the COVID-19 response. But that situation could easily have changed very quickly.  However, going forward for any emergency response, it is appropriate to have adequate coverage of controllers for all the EOCs operating in the Waikato. The Civil Defence and Emergency Management Group Joint Committee decision and the recommendations in this report will provide the necessary appointments and delegation coverage going forward. So this resolution has been requested to be passed by all the territorial authorities  councils in the Waikato region who is represented by the Joint Committee. And Councillor Lou Brown is our Civil Defence and Emergency Management Joint Committee representative, and he may wish to speak further on this matter. But essentially, the recommendation is noted in paragraphs 2A, B and C for your decision. That's a report, Your Worship.",

So, the COVID-19 event was, I guess,  reflected by the joint committee about the adequate coverage and sustainability of controllers across the Waikato region, particularly in a pandemic situation where if a controller did 4L, they're locked away for 14 odd days, we could take down an EOC with them in terms of having to isolate themselves. So it can result in any situation  further emergency situation, be it a pandemic or other event, where local controllers can come in who are Tier 2 local controllers appointed by the group and be represented within any EOC within the Waikato region. So currently there are a number of Western Waikato local controllers that can operate amongst the three councils in our area.  I also have authority to operate in Waikato District. So, there is already some resolutions appointing controllers to operate amongst a number of councils in any event. But this just gives the authority for all local controllers to operate within any territorial authority for any future event. Greg Morgan Thank you, Wayne. Thank you.",

So I'll just, I'll take it as read, but just very briefly taking you through the recommendations. So the first one is to appoint Councillors Brown and Gordon, who are accredited commissioners now. Congratulations on to the read committee to augment the capacity there to take hearings. Under item C of the recommendation, the first delegation, which is part,  That's a delegation under the Local Government Act. So the reason I'm explaining this is it appears there might be a bit of double up there in the delegations, but there's a reason for it. So the first part is the delegation under the Local Government Act, and there's a tidy up there to the Forest and Rural Fires Act, which no longer applies. The second part, which is part C, is a delegation under the Resource Management Act. And there is actually a correction under item three there. So the wrong strikeout has gone through, so that should read  Resource Management Act hearings and commissioners. Commissioners has been struck out by mistake. The third delegation under recommendation D is the actual matters that can be heard under the Resource Management Act. So that lists what can be heard. So I just wanted to explain what those recommendations were and happy to take any questions.",

It's good to be part of the panel when you know you've got more experienced people there. And I just feel it's really important for the new people that they do get the chance to participate.

So certainly we can bring on that range of skills for either resource consents and or plan changes when we need them. And also if requested by an applicant as well.

So one of my shorter reports this morning, hopefully it makes general sense that in this case, the annual calendar that you've approved previously, the card club haven't been able to use the dates that were allocated to them in April and have proposed amendments to their calendar to try and get their programme back on track while at the same time,  complying with the district plan rules. So you've got a revised, sorry, Murphy's Law, something would happen.  And basically, you've got the previous report there and the calendar that you've approved previously, and then a revised calendar tacked onto the back of that. So effectively, they've surrendered, if you like, 16 days on the April calendar, and have replaced those with 15 days spread over June and July, which by my assessment, still complies with the rule. So that's the summary there, and happy to take any questions.",

So we generally supply a copy to Waikato District for their information, put a copy on our website, and Mystery Creek make it available. So we've had no feedback over the last couple of years about events within this zone. But at the end of the day, the assessment is that it still complies with the plan.  And most of the days are practice days, they're not race days. So there is an argument that they may not even meet the criteria to be considered as noise days, but it just makes sense to have them all summarized in one place. So I'm not anticipating any issues in that respect. And we'll have an opportunity potentially to look at again  of Mystery Creek themselves come back with alternative dates. So obviously, Field Days is not taking place in that calendar as proposed, and they may have some other changes later that we have given them the opportunity to look at once they know what's happening with their schedule.

So in February we did a full re-forecast as per normal. Obviously the events that occurred in the two or three weeks following that, it was still pretty fresh on the paper, basically meant that we had to fully review all of our organisational budgets again.  and they say this is the first finance report that you've seen where that forecast column reflects the impact of COVID-19 or the expected impact of COVID-19.

Development reserves and contributions of four point six million have been received, which is seventy five percent of the forecast.  Finance income is currently at 99% of the current budget.

Capital expenditure to date is 76 million, which is 71% of the forecast.  And with our rates at the moment, oh, there were no arbitrage arrangements within the month of April.

There's a balance outstanding of 12.4 million for the current year, which is after the final instalment, which was due 21st of May.  and the water rate status, there was 534,000 outstanding, and that also includes 345,000, which is not yet due.
