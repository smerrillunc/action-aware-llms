    "text": " Good morning. Welcome to the really extraordinary meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee for the 23rd of November. We only have one item on the agenda in effect, which is the annual report. And as I think Ken has done good work over the night after discussions with Leon, we have a slightly changed  program today, but perhaps in good order, I should just deal with some of the preliminaries first, please. Do I have any apologies? As I was going around the team, it looks like we've got a full turnout. Thank you for that. Are there any apologies? It will be a reasonably short meeting, so I assume we can all be here. Any matters of interest that we need to disclose?  Again, I would assume not, so we can do that. There is ultimately a late item in the sense that I will be tabling a late resolution that we adjourn the meeting to the, I think the 30th of November, but we'll get to that at the end of the process. Otherwise, as I said, the order of the meeting is reasonably simple.  The matter is obviously the annual report, but given the events, I think, Ken, in the first instance, best to hand to you first and then Leon and your team. But we also have just agreed very quickly prior to the meeting that given there is in effect a delay,  Members, if there's any matters that you wanted to raise now over the annual report, we might as well take a wee bit of time this morning just to deal with any questions you might have, and give a chance to get them cleared up for when we meet again later next week. So, Ken, in your hands, please. Oh, sorry, check, members, are you happy with that sort of broad and formal order? Any questions about the order and process we're having?  Good, thank you. Keen, we're in your hands.",

    "text": " OK. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. Good morning, committee, and good morning, Leon. Good that you could join us this morning. Yeah, so look, as you're well aware from some email correspondence last night, we are in the slightly uncomfortable and unfortunate position where obviously the purpose of this meeting today was to seek the committee's recommendation.  that we adopt the annual report at a council meeting that's at 9 a.m. this morning. Unfortunately, we haven't quite got there. So, look, this year's audit was relatively challenging.  for a whole number of reasons, but I guess one of the things that has caught us out a little is the fact that we did a revaluation of our entire infrastructure, so our waters assets and our roading assets. In the lead up to that, there was quite a cleanup of our asset systems.  which basically resulted in some discovered assets, assets that we hadn't actually known existed, but hey presto, they did. So obviously having to get them onto the books, but actually the reverse was also true. So as we tidied up our asset registers to be able to perform that revaluation, we found some assets on our asset registers that actually shouldn't have been there,  And actually, and this is probably one of the one of the key concerns, actually shouldn't have been there for quite some years. And so, yeah, so there's been a lot of a lot of work going into that space, both from the Waip\u0101 team and from Audit New Zealand.  and quite a delay earlier in the process as we waited for Audit New Zealand's technical team to form a view on the treatment of those discovered assets coming onto the books and the non-existent assets being disposed out of the books. So I'll let Leon talk to that soon because, of course, it was his technical team who were forming that view.  So, yeah, so look, that and some other matters meant that while we thought we were going to get there in terms of being able to\u2014 and, in fact, we are so, so, so close to being there in terms of being able to present you with an annual report with Audit New Zealand clearance\u2014  Yeah, we reached the conclusion quite late this afternoon. Myself and Leon had a phone call, and he pretty much conveyed that, yeah, look, they just wouldn't be able to get there, certainly by 8 a.m. this morning. So, yeah, the situation is that, yeah, over the next couple of days, we both believe we'll be in a position to have this annual report totally cleared.  ready to go. And so the intention is to adjourn this meeting and reconvene next Tuesday afternoon after finance and corporate with an order and risk committee and a council meeting. That's our intention. What we will do between now and then is to actually basically provide you with some additional information.  In fact, that is mostly prepared. We mostly prepared that over the weekend and yesterday, which will set out quite clearly the changes that have been incorporated into the annual report between the draft that you received for this agenda and the draft that we will be asking you to basically adopt next Tuesday.  So watch this space as soon as we're in a position to send that out with the amended documents. We will do that so that we can reconvene next Tuesday. Just one other comment to note. So the other thing that we received yesterday was we did receive a number of  a number of annotations from Councillor St Pierre. So, yeah, so we've had a look at those. Yeah, a lot of those and, yeah, if you can give me the licence, licence, Clare, I think we could probably say a lot of those are quite minor typographical type corrections. So, yeah, so the team will work through making those changes as well as considering any other matters you raise.  And, Bruce, I believe it would be good if any of the members today have any concerns or any changes that they'd like to the annual report. Obviously, we've got the capacity to do those over the next couple of days, if those are known. So, yeah, so those are my comments. I see there's a couple of hands raised, but also we do need to go to Leon.",

    "text": " yeah okay so um so roger i guess um yeah i guess um yeah local local government infrastructure networks are relatively complex space um so um yeah so so so so things like um like roading assets  If you were to look at our asset register, you would see that our roading assets are quite complex. We basically have assets for relatively short lengths of roading.  So if you take a street, say Hall Street in Cambridge, the asset register for that, for Hall Street in Cambridge, there would be several short lengths of road that are recorded in the asset register. But not only the length, there's also a layering element. So the asset is made up of a multitude of components.  and essentially there is a sub-base component, so the compacted earth bit below the road, there is a base course element to the roading asset, and that is a separate component, and then of course there is the top seal as well. So lots of small lengths and multiple components,  And look, yeah, look, during the, you know, over time, like these asset registers have got thousands and thousands and thousands of assets on them, hundreds of thousands of little asset components. Yeah, look, just sometimes things go wrong and when some of those assets are renewed,  you know, perhaps the old part has not been written out completely, the new part has come on. So, yeah, so look, they are quite complex, probably a little less complex than the water space, but still some difficulty in terms of, you know, very, very small components in the water space.  So, yeah, I don't think, you know, unfortunately, we don't have Amy Turner here who looks after our asset registers. She could probably talk at a bit more length about this. But, yeah, I think what we've got here is not too unusual for local government in New Zealand. In fact, perhaps Leon could perhaps support their comment in terms of seeing asset registers across a large number of councils.",

You know, I think a lot of these actual assets, and in fact, a large number of them, I think we had them dating back to, some of them were dating back to about 1947. So some of the assets that we disposed of. So we are talking about fairly historic matters that we're tidying up here.",

    "text": "Good. So, Roger, thank you for that question. And for the rest of the members, if you were to go to page 122 of our agenda,  you would see the note that describes the nature of the change. And Roger, I don't blame you if you don't understand it because it was a small point I was going to make about jargon. Multiple duplicated and overlapping pavement layers is the reason.  which is when you look at Hall Street, you look down, you start to realise that from both an engineering and an accounting perspective, we see at least three layers below us, not just the tar seal on top of us. And can I take your point that over time, although I think you're arguing or you're suggesting to us from a systems perspective, not currently, but previously,  our accuracy in decommissioning assets when they're being replaced has been less than what we would hope. I think equally, probably, because I think the number is, what about a $17 million prior period adjustment? This is something that we have done in small increments probably over time. And if you're saying, Ken, 1947,  You can reflect, even I wasn't alive in 1947, believe it or not. It's a long way back that we've accrued probably on an annual basis, a relatively immaterial amount.  but when you've done when we've understood that this shows the value of a revaluation of your asset base and a scrubbing of your data which actually by the way has its connotations as you well know over the last two years for water assets scrubbing our data gives rise to obviously what is an unenviable but realistic adjustment that's come through. So page 121  122, I think it's whatever that number gives us the background to it. Right, before we get to Leon, Susan, is there anything that you want to say? Are you happy to wait till we've heard from Leon?  Oh, right, you had mute on, so I assume that you're happy. So Leon, welcome to the meeting. And can I say from a bit of context, I appreciate the challenges you face getting to the finish line this year. My last meeting so far is the 21st of December to adopt a set of annual reports. So I appreciate the effort that's going on. Leon, we're in your hands. Thank you, Bruce.",

    "text": "Then I got to everyone.  Yeah, it's, I think today is one of the very few meetings in my professional life where I feel like I have to apologize to a lot of things. So first of all, I have to apologize that we raised in our management report that we think asset information should be improved, because this led to this error. And the finding of this error  And as Ken already said, and he explained it very well, I'm not gonna dwell on that, is also, it is across the board. We see it at quite a few councils. So you're not alone. The second thing I have to apologize is for the delay in causing you to have extra meetings. That's not the way I operate. I don't like it. And as a professional, I'm not enjoying it too much.  Apart from the comments Ken already made about the challenges to the audit, for instance, this prior year, there were quite some other technical issues that we had to work through. And of course, because of the improvement of our audit quality, we keep on asking more insightful questions and causing audits to take a bit longer. But then the big thing for this year was, of course, the auditor shortage.  And the impact of the COVID-19, especially the lockdown in Waikato, caused quite a bit of stress on my team. And we were just not as efficient as we would be in a normal year. So unfortunately, I flagged this to Ken last Friday that  we're at risk. And last night, I had to say, we're not going to get there. And because the Local Government Act, of course, expect you to adopt and audit it, and your report, we just couldn't couldn't finish the audit in time. The last changes were made this morning and came through. So what Ken said about we're not weeks or months away, we are days away for us to work through the last changes. So  That's about my update, Bruce.",

So, look, the critical thing is that talking with Ken last night, and I think just following on from your comments, Leon, my understanding is that this can be cleaned up so that when we meet on the 30th, we've got a  a high percentage chance that there's nothing going to kick us past that date. I want to say it's certain, but nothing's certain in the annual report world this year. But essentially, you're really saying we need the rest of the week to clean this up and get it right. So we're always better to take that time. We've already made that decision once before in the sort of process that rather than place people under total pressure, we should do that. And I'm comfortable to sponsor that view in front of my colleagues.  So look, members, is there any other points around the annual report, though, that we could helpfully raise this morning before we move to the motion to adjourn the meeting in terms of the actual annual report?

I sit on the community board, and I don't think the community board's impression of itself, nor the impression that council has of the community board, is that we actually work in partnership at all. So I don't know that that's a really good way of describing, I mean, they exercise and enjoy a significant amount of independence, and often talk about keeping checks and balances on us. So I don't know that that's a really apt description of the role of community boards. So if that perhaps could be looked at, that would be helpful.

Hey, you know, he's giving me the thumbs up. So best we don't make reference to it if it doesn't exist. So if we can pull that one out, that would be good. And then moving on then to my next one, which is on the following page, page 35, second paragraph, it says, we're guided through our partnership with mana whenua, working with our treaty partners  Now, this is obviously a point of some discussion, I guess, around our table. We're not actually in partnership with, we're not party to the Treaty, so it probably would be best described as working with the Crown's Treaty partners, because we're not party to the Treaty. That's my understanding of it. And then the following sentence as it continues, explains to create a new M\u0101ori ward so we can better represent you for greater collaboration.  I'm not sure that you is the right word to be using in that sentence. So if that could perhaps have a little bit polish up, that would be cool.

I'm not sure,  Help me understand if I'm wrong here, how buying local particularly addresses the environmental and cultural wellbeing of our community.

This mainly relates to higher than expected growth in the district and the timing of receiving assets from developers.  included in this is the Waikeria prison expansion. I assume that's relating to changes to the roading that we dealt with because the prison expansion itself is not even in our district. So it might pay to make that a bit clearer because obviously that's not our, Waikeria's expansion wasn't our fish to fry.  particularly?",

Now, I've just really found that the 12-month snapshot documents, which sort of start from about page 126 onwards, got some real  I can tell how there have been errors made, because I assume they were just picked up out of press releases, but that sometimes they're awkwardly worded, the tense is wrong, it's all just a little bit weird. So the first one for me is on page 126 under September 2020. The summary there in respect of the Memorial Park, the War Memorial Park, it just seems a really strange thing to,  to include there. So it's on page 126. I accept it probably was lifted out of some documents, but it really doesn't make sense in terms of what we're trying to encapsulate there. Because ultimately, it goes on to say that  that local board felt heard, you know, it just seems weird. So perhaps if that can be made more appropriate, make more sense with what we're trying to do there. Equally so, over the page, on page 127, the bit about October 2020, iwi representatives appointed. The sense is wrong there, or the tense is wrong there. It should be four iwi representatives were appointed, not have been, because obviously I assume it was lifted out of a press release.  So to make it make sense, that should be there. And then two, in the next paragraph, refers to Liz, the Waip\u0101 deputy mayor, probably pays to capitalise the deputy mayor part of her role. And then in December 2020, down the page further, on that page, again, just a tense thing, it says, in terms of the Lake Te Kootu water quality forward paragraph, it says, the plan has three stages, perhaps it should be had three stages.  Same thing again over the next page on March, 2021, in terms of the Waikeria Wastewater Pump Station paragraph. The major wastewater construction project was completed, not is completed. And then the paragraph about what's next, Waip\u0101. I mean, there's sort of a bundle in there. There's a sense when you read it that the,  that we went out to our communities under the long-term plan and included discussion around the creation of a M\u0101ori ward. They were two separate issues, and it doesn't read that way in that paragraph. So if somebody can perhaps look at making it look very clear that these were campaigns or community engagement, if it's made on separate occasions, because of course then it resolves itself over the page and it talks about the two things happening. So...  That was good. And then moving on to page 193, just got a query about the measure in terms of water supply and demand is managed to ensure prudent use of water, whereas they fell short in terms of that kihikihi measure. And it says there that explanation for not reaching that target was that water loss  had increased in the past year. Water was taken from Kehekehe network for the Waikeria prison fires. Some unmetered connections linked to new developments were found, and some notable links within council network attributed to this. I guess I just want some assurance that those were all fixed. If they were so significant that they caused us to not reach our targets, I guess it would be helpful to have some certainty to the reader that those have been attended to.",

But look, we had to make various assumptions in regard to the revaluation reserve component on those assets, et cetera. So look, this is complex, and the adjustments we've made are not absolutely perfect, because we did not have the information to make those adjustments perfect.  and look in regard to that depreciation that's been charged.

So, look, yeah, if you look back on our past annual reports, we have quite often had discovered assets and we have quite often had asset write-offs. So that have occurred as part of revaluation processes.  So, look, this is not unusual, and again, I fall back on the fact it's not unusual for local government, due to the complexity of our asset records, to identify these things as you go into a revaluation.  So, look, the numbers this time were large, so I think this is abnormal in terms of the size of the data scrub exercise, or certainly what's the results of the data scrub exercise.

I would just also support Leon's comments from my work elsewhere.  that actually I've got at least one or two engagements where they have particular and specific projects to really look at the data. It reflects two things. One, our assets are long life and our previous practice has not been great. It also reflects that actually we need to bring in our infrastructure services side and integrate it with our financial side. I'm not saying that's not the case at Waip\u0101,  But what I'm trying to reflect is sectorally, that is a substantial challenge, believe it or not. OK, can I just raise just minor points now, Ken, please, just to get through my list. One is on page 44 of the balanced budget test.  That's quite a significant difference. I think we're at 79%. Is that right, a balanced budget? I just wonder whether we just have a slightly bigger paragraph there that explains more fully why we are in a prudent position.  I'm conscious the balanced budget test has a correct connotation that we will rate in the year sufficient revenue to meet our expenses. I mean, that's essentially the balanced budget test, right? Section 100. The fact that we are  under at 89%, sorry I said 79, at 89 suggests that for some reason we are either under our asset base, we're not rating enough, or the likes. I think we just need a stronger statement for our external readers, and I'm talking to the Department of Internal Affairs here, which just supports that. That seems to me to be a reasonably important one.  Page 55, there's just a, you will do it, there'll be a small sweep of the numbers because I think we obviously have had minor adjustments to the accounts, but I notice the explanation of the operating surplus has a surplus of 40.5, whereas if my reading is correct,  You are dead correct, it's actual for 2021. Oh, it's with the group, sorry, I was looking at the parent. Got that one solved, there we are. Sometimes you read these things too fast. Can I go over to page 58? Surprised me, and it may be that I've got to go back and just check out. We have a budget for, and the cash flow for purchase property plan equipment of 170 million, and we have an achievement of 74.  Is that right? It must be, to be honest, because it balances. But it just struck me as a somewhat large number. And I just wondered how that's set. It's been right. Is that a right number? That we're 100 million shy of what we plan to spend?",

And yes, you're right in that, well, it was part of the calculation for collecting depreciation and it's been reinvested and all that. But another side of it is we collected too much and should actually we be, yeah, I suppose, adjusting our rating going forward. I mean, I'd just like to understand that in more detail, really.",

    "text": " Now, that would be a difficult proposition, actually, Clare. Can I say, I think we just, and this is why we have to accept it's an error. I mean, arguably, we've taken off individual ratepayers' money sooner than we should have. But as you've heard from Ken, and I don't want to overstress, if we're going back to 1947, so which ratepayer do we reimburse, if you can put it that way?  That's why I think we have to, as we are here, fess up that we haven't got it right for, I think, some pretty understandable reasons, but nevertheless, the impact. And I think the other thing that Leon said through the process was while $18 million is a large number in any one year,  it has been immaterial to the point of minuscule in any of those years, so the level of  overrating, or potentially, quite frankly, the insurance impact is probably pretty marginal. Now, that's why I say, look at 80 million in any one year, that's a big number for all of us. But the reality of it is this is accumulated over a considerable number of years. The best thing I think we can do, and this is actually, and I'd like to suggest, Ken, that perhaps later on in the fullness of time,  Perhaps we should have another revisit of this in our discussion, particularly with Dawn, around just how things are going from the maintenance of our database, or our asset databases, so that we can have some confidence that we won't fall into this hole or trap later on. I'd just like to point out, I'm not suggesting that we go through and try and reimburse individual ratepayers over those",

    "text": " Yeah, so on that, Chair, I mean, obviously we know what components we've reversed in terms of revaluation reserve pertaining to those assets, in terms of accumulated depreciation pertaining to those assets. But the trouble is that once you start getting further back than nine or 10 years, you really can't tell how much those revaluation reserves and perhaps the accumulated depreciation  have been essentially inflated due to incorrect or over-depreciation or over-regulation for assets that didn't exist. So while we could tell you exactly what we've reversed in both those respects, the baseline issue is that some of this is really historic data and therefore we can't actually determine the correctness of some of that if we go further back.",

    "text": " And to bamboozle us all with numbers, there's also two other matters which affect that, and actually, you've got to understand what is the funding strategy in years gone by, because if we go back to past practices where we have cash funded, probably we've never rated for the depreciation anyway in the past. And the other thing, of course, we've also got discovered assets, so we have been under depreciating.  for those discovered assets, potentially, and not seeking the right level of funding off our ratepayer and community. So that's why, Claire, given this is a matter that's accrued over time, we have to be incredibly transparent, I think, in the way that we are, and we have to acknowledge that it's a mistake, and really treat it on that basis.  I'm very conscious of time. We've made very good use of the hour, Ken. I do hope that's been helpful for you and Leon to have had a sense from the committee as to what might be some final changes. I do just want to, again, compliment the committee for actually diligence in going through this. It's actually superb. And I do appreciate your attention to detail.  even if it's tensors and what have you, I think the quality of our annual report always reflects on that. The one other thing, though, that before I move that we adjourn the meeting to next, was it Tuesday? It doesn't matter. Tuesday, thank you. It might be good for me to make certain I've got that right again. I just note that actually we've also got a summary here.  And while it's pretty much a pickup from the annual report, did people look at that? Was there any matter that people want to raise around the summary? Right, Leon, just one thing that would be helpful for next week, obviously, is to pre-circulate the draft opinion. Can I ask at this stage, what does that opinion look like? Is it unmodified?",

So look, firstly, I'd like to therefore move the  Motion that we now adjourn this meeting of the Audit and Risk Committee to 2pm, I think is the designated time on the 30th of November. I'll move that. Thank you, Roger. You second that. I'll put the motion. All those in favour, please say aye.  Those against? It's carried. So, look, just before we close, can I just again, Leon, thank you and your team. I know the pressure is great from not just this audit, but from across all the commitments, so I'm certainly overviewing.  and know that it's stressful. So thank you for your good humour this morning and honesty. And we certainly look forward to next Tuesday getting to the finish line, which will be superb. And look, I will just Ken, and I can see Yolanda and I think there's at least one other name there I should, Nada as well. Thank you. Thank you for your  very hard work to get us here as well. I know that for both you and the auditors, this is the third external accountability document, last year's annual report, the LTP. And now this virtually all in a row, you've been living in each other's pockets massively to get there. So thank you also for your hard yards to get us here.
