Planning and processes have enabled Council to continue to develop services for staff  absent due to being positive, self-isolating or looking after sick dependents. The implementation of staff work bubbles so far has been an effective strategy. Council has also registered for the close contact exemption scheme and has secured a supply of rat tests through CoLab, which we've been using.

An update on the quarterly risk report is that you'll see arrows trending upwards for three of Council's top risks. The top three are risk management, risk management policy, and the top three are risk management policy.  The uncertainties with COVID continue and have escalated as we ride the Omicron wave. Council have responded to a letter from the lawyer for a group opposing vaccine mandates for our facilities. Further drops of flyers for raising funds for this initiative were conducted in Cambridge last week, and Diana will provide further info in her item.  There's also a number of legumes requesting a review of the policy and how frequently it will be reviewed. CMT are now formally reviewing the facilities and staff mandate vaccine policies fortnightly. And note that Taupo actually has removed the policy. So I think you'll be a bit more pressure.  The employment market is challenging, and there are skills shortages for key roles. Therefore, Top Risk 1 has been highlighted as trending upwards, and Top Risk 14 is also trending upwards, and a separate report is being presented on this risk. The majority of top risk mitigants  A deep dive of the emerging risk around procurement of external consultants for resource consents and development engineering has been completed. Actions are underway that will mitigate this risk to within Council's appetite.

And there were recommendations which were saying, yes, we've got some good processes in place, but to further enhance those, you could also do this, this, and this.

That's taken some time to work through in terms of both of us sort of being comfortable with the document, getting design work incorporated. And so it's meant that much of our program from this year is going to slide. It goes out for tender late this month, hoping to award next month.  It's a three-year renewals contract for both organisations. It's a positive, it's just meant there's been a delay in our programme of work. But yeah, as I say, once we've got a contractor in place, it means that next year we'll probably over-deliver because of that work moving through into next year.

So I accept, you know, from a risk perspective, that we just get a summary here, which would make sense. I think you would find that our funders would expect the Audit and Risk Committee to have some oversight of the Treasury management parameters. So it might even be that actually  rather than it being turf warfare, that in terms of this financial summary, we also include the core parameters that the LGFA would expect us to stick to. I do think it would be useful at some stage for a more fuller report, and I think  I mean, obviously Finance and Corporate I assume is committee of the whole. It would probably make sense that it was there. So I would think it would be good even if I was arguably to zoom in for the half hour that it would take. I think that would be useful.  for us to be able to have a discussion with Earl about the risks. I mean, he automatically has said, and it's great, it's not that we have to be in the operational decision-making room, but it's clear that he was giving you some advice that actually we were moving presumably outside our treasury management parameters.  and those parameters are actually what we should be doing our governance on. So if I could just leave that with you, Ken, to think through. I don't want to tread on too many corporate governance toes around the place, but I do think the committee just has to have a weird of optics over that in due course. I'll leave it in your hands.",

I thought that the language is really enabling and I think the framework and the points that are given as sort of leaders for people to be thinking about risk are really good. There's obviously been a lot of work  put into what's going to be an effective framework, I think. In fact, there's some aspects I really like. One that I really enjoyed finding out about was on page 46 of our agenda, which I think is page nine of the last appendix. It talks about  tools available to assist with understanding the effectiveness of the risks current controls and I thought that would be really interesting actually because then it's the effectiveness of the controls is obviously you know the critical factor and it's great to see a resource that's or a tool that's going to be developed for that yeah yeah there was just one minor typo that I picked up which is so this is in the  The last one, which is the guide to risk management process and risk matrices. So that's on page five of that document or page 42 of our agenda under risk evaluation. The first bullet point and the last sentence. It says, in other words, risk evaluation determines the how much risk we are willing to tolerate. And I think it should be just determines how much risk we're willing to tolerate there.  But I just think, yeah, congratulations. A lot of work's been done. It reflects the quality of work that's been put into it, actually. I really like it, and yeah, I think well done. Thanks.",

And how do we react when we're encouraging them to achieve, but risk crystallizes?  So just to reflect on that, but that's only a reflection. In terms of the second appendix, Claire, you quite rightly pushing us along and I should be pushed along. Is there any questions people have over this? Because this actually is quite an important document. It outlines tolerances around risk. It outlines what should come to us, for instance, or where risk should be managed and what's tolerable. Is there any comments people would like to make on this?  While you're thinking about that, I'll ask a couple of questions. Jenny, I must confess, possibly being too quick through it, but on page 33 of our agenda, the note around actually how to interpret the action required of staff, just had me slightly, I read it a few times and I'm probably gonna read it out now and it'll probably fall into place. But it's this example, that for a particular risk has a residual rating of medium, but an appetite  target of low, the relevant program department manager project or risk manager should escalate this to the relevant GM. I'm just missing the rationale why. That's actually a direct take from our previous policy.  I was just trying to work out, is it because it's medium? Is it because we haven't achieved the low? Because the table above just says if it's assessed as medium, management responsibly specified.  I don't know quite what that means, but I presume somewhere there's a specification, presumably within Teams, and I'm looking to see whereabouts in the organization it sits. Managed by specified monitoring and agreed upon procedures, relevant program, can accept this level. This didn't greatly explain for me what that actually meant. Can I ask you to check? I don't think we can take a lot of time on this one at this stage.",

It's the differential between that and the risk appetite. So if the risk appetite is lower than what that residual risk is, we have to make sure that we're managing that well. And yeah, we might not be able to  you know, get it right down to low, which is where we want our appetite to be. But it kind of means, you know, I've got to be on my toes about this because, you know, we recognize that things might go awry, even though it's only a medium risk. That was my interpretation.

What interested me in terms of identifying the appetite was I was looking for a line, and I guess it really comes in the matrix at the back. Let me see if I can find it. For some reason I've just lost all of my notations. I can't work out why.  And it's probably consequence where there is these good lenses through which we look at the consequence. So if it has an environment consequence, these are how we assess the impacts. I was wondering, and I'll leave it as a suggestion, not as a demand, George and Jenny, is there a chance for a line there called the LTP?  I think it may be there partly through, I don't know what it's looking at, governance legislative compliance control, but our LTP has got to be real. It is how we are going to work out our vision for Waip\u0101.  And it would strike me that actually to have a line in here, a lens, looking at an impact, that is how does this affect our long-term plan would be a useful addition. So I leave that there as a suggestion. It's not something that I'm gonna hold up approval of the matrices on, but I would just like to reflect that. Folk, we've spent more time than probably we've been allotted, but we've had, hopefully, a good discussion. Is there anything else folk would like to raise over these matrices at this stage?  Right, can we go back to the resolutions then, please? I just need to navigate my way around this baby.

The consequences are still major, but the likelihood is still really high, especially for this month and next month.  I think the approach that we're taking as a team is really, we have quite a high set of skills within the team, which at times are interchangeable. With this particular impact from that team, we had made really good progress before this person got affected.  And that is the intention that I'm committed to is that we don't really tend to be a reactive team. We are very proactive in the sense that we're delivering documents and work streams ahead of the deadlines.  and timeframes that are actually within our own program. So with this one in particular it has shown actually that the approach has been quite well attended to, if I can say it this way.  Yeah, we had done some really good progress on that particular work stream and I feel that we're still in a good place, even with this person being still off work for now.  So that is really the kind of approach that we're gonna keep going and that is, and to have actually this happening right now is reinforcing the attitude that we need to have to any type of deliverables.

I guess we'll take the plan as read, but I guess there's a couple of points that I just did want to emphasise, is the plan has been developed looking, I guess, at a combination of factors. So Bonita and Mataza have talked to senior members across staff in the development of the plan. And what it's seeking to do is, I guess, balance council's risk profile.  what's happening in the external environment, but also being cognizant of the capacity that council has in regards to the internal audit programme and the subsequent improvement programmes that lead out of them. So what we're doing here is we're seeking approval of the plan for the 22, 23 year, and also the two out of years, but noting that they are indicative, and every year we do come and just confirm that that's still how we want to proceed for those two out of years.  And the other thing I do just want to draw your attention to is page 94 of the agenda, which outlines three audits that were discussed in some detail throughout the development of the plan. And we didn't want to lose sight of those audits, but wanted to give the committee a level of information and understanding why they haven't been included in the plan at this point.  So we'll be happy to take questions about that afterwards. But Bonita and Mataza, I'll hand over to you to give us your thoughts on the plan. Thanks, George.",

It is a three-year plan, and as George said, you know, 23 being more firm with 24, 25 being indicative. So we'll do an annual refresh come the start of the years two and three.  very similar to what we have done this time. Really good, open, candid conversations with management, some robust discussions, as George said, around the prioritisation. And we do understand that, you know, with the internal audit history in the last few years, there has been  quite a few improvement initiatives and programs that have been put in place to make sure that those recommendations actually get implemented, which will then in turn help with the risk mitigation in the business. So therefore, you'd see that for FY23, we've got three spots, two of those. We've got two really solid reviews around fees and charges. We haven't looked at that in the previous years,  And also climate change, which is obviously part of your top risks, but also very topical across the sector, across New Zealand, I should say. So that gives us good confidence that we are looking at areas that will have great impact for the council.  And as George said, some of those other areas, Bruce, you were involved in some of those discussions around those three areas. We'll keep a watch on that. And as things evolve, maybe that's included in ES2425, but that will come through the prioritization process. So I'm pretty confident of the plan and really echo your  sentiments around the process we've gone through to develop it. Happy to take any feedback or questions.",

Okay, well, look, just a couple of comments. One, I know we've got the floater in there, which I think that's a fair enough phrase. I just want to,  I'm glad you've got that held over for the holiday pay. If it needs to, from the current review, makes a lot of sense. I'd say this to my committee members, that the Holiday Pay Act is still tripping up many of us around the country. So it's useful that we're getting a citer on that and have that capacity.

I mean, a lot of these internal audit exercises have certainly cost, you know, $30,000, $35,000. That's absolutely fine. I guess my initial reaction to the $52,500 is that that's quite a lot. Although, of course, I do recognise that you are testing three streams of very significant revenue.  in terms of building control, resource management, resource consent processing, as well as development contributions.

There has been significant work undertaken to implement the recommendations from the initial audits that were undertaken by KPMG.  KPMG have done a very thorough follow-up review, which has suggested some further actions we could take to address the recommendations they've identified as partially implemented. Some of these will be reliant on our TEC1 system having the capability to deliver on our requirements. For example, the recommendation around supplier performance reporting. This has been noted as partially implemented under action five in the contract management actions.  Other actions such as the internal monitoring and enforcing compliance will be developed and will also be dependent on availability of resource to support this. Further development of organisation-wide guidance on contingency setting and contract management will be part of the work that's undertaken on the Waip\u0101 Council Procurement Manual and will also be part of the Regional Procurement Principles Policy and Procedures Document Review.

And as part of that, there will be contract reviews, which will include contractor reviews. There is just a subtle difference between contractors and suppliers. So the supplier system is a slightly separate system. And that's one where we would actually need to go and talk to Tech One about  what we could implement there in terms of measuring supplier performance. But the contractor performance will certainly be a part of the contracts module, which the contracts module is in place now. We're just in developing the reviews component of that.",

Bruce, one of the things that we missed alongside item eight, the deep dive on risks, was there was a five minute break.  which we're looking to incorporate into these meetings every hour or so. Can I suggest we perhaps have a five-minute break now, and I will endeavour to contact Leon. Let's see if we can do items 12, 13, and 14.  and then I'm confident we will then have some time to get into item 18, dive into risks after Leon and before lunch. Yeah, would that work for people?",
