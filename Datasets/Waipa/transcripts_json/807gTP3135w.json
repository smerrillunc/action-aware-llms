Hopefully, we'll be back in the chambers before the end of the year, but it's hard to imagine we'll be back there in November somehow, the way things are shaping up. But anyway, hope everyone's well. And we've got a full council here, so there's no apologies this morning.  So are there any disclosures of members' interest? Mark, Marcus, sorry. The item about the liquor licensing tab, which one is it? I know the one you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, whichever one it is. Yeah. Thanks, Marcus. Anyone else? OK, well, we'll note that, Marcus, when we get to that point.  Okay, are there any late items that anyone wishes to raise? No, no late items. So confirmation of the order of the meeting, item four. I haven't heard anybody wants to change the order, so can I have a mover and seconder? Move Phillip, seconded Roger. All those in favour? Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.

But we're very grateful for the discretionary grants we received from the Prangi Award and Te Amida Community Board, much appreciated.  Our community patrols have been severely affected by COVID. About half a kilometre has travelled in September for this year than the previous 2020 September. But double admin due to the level changes. When we get to the appropriate level, we'll be getting these patrols again. The CCTV  training, we did 12 and a half hours and the CC monitoring, CCTV monitoring, 32 hours. So there's quite a few hours of voluntary labor there. There are 25 active patrollers and only one of those is unvaccinated. And currently there are 21 CCTV members monitoring those cameras with a potential of up to 36, which the more we have, the easier the workload.  And while I've got to just a bit off track a bit, but I'd like to thank staff personally. Gary, could you pass that on? The queries that I've had have been answered by staff, I know in difficult conditions. And one of them, I actually replied to him that you're a legend, because I got back to one of the rate payers, and I just really appreciative of where they seem to get the information from. And if you could pass it on. So that's me. Thank you.",

So along with a lot of other councillors attended the Kiiki Community Open Day, which was, I guess, a new initiative was put together mostly by Mandy, I think, from ComSafe and Kiiki. So that was really good to attend.  Also, as Phillip alluded to, there was a forum, it was a business forum essentially, a breakfast, where we could talk about Three Waters, talk about local government reform, and any other sort of issues in our district. So I thought it was really helpful, and I think there were close to 100 people online listening to it. So I like to think that, yeah, that might continue in the future.  For the rest of the month, yeah, mostly just, I guess, dealing with the COVID outbreak that we've had in our own district. This could have happened to any other provincial town, I think, but what it did do, of course, was give us a bit of a platform to encourage our residents to get vaccinated. So I think it's been quite widespread, as already alluded, One News, Jim, this weekend, but also we've had quite good coverage, Radio New Zealand, Newstalk ZB,  Waikato Times, obviously our local Cambridge and Te Amuru papers as well. So hopefully we're getting a really clear message out there around the vaccination and how we should all move towards that.  Thanks to Andrew and Lou for the video I'm dragging out on the weekend. Again, just a pro-vaccination message and also to Hazel and Marcus. In fact, I've had lots of comments actually about Hazel, you in particular, about bringing the emotion a little bit into the reality of living day to day.  from residents, but yeah, thanks to everyone. Whether we continue with the videos, I think it would be a good conversation to have today at some point. A lot of people have been talking to me about how we might connect with our community. So yeah, that's it, thank you.",

    "text": "Yeah, good morning, everybody. Hey, it seems like it's a long time ago, but anyway,  I attended the, along with Lou actually, the Urban Miners Collection Day in Te Amuru. I see, looking at my calendar, it actually was since our last meeting. So it was a wildly successful collection. They collected something, they passed something like just over $3,000 worth of transactions through, which I believe was a record. So that was the, obviously the Urban Miners Collection Day in Te A, really, really well supported.  Like Liz, I attended the Kehekehe Community Connect Day, and obviously it was a bit limited due to the alert levels, but it was from all accounts a success and really neat to see all those active community groups in that area there that day. Lou also organised the Te Umuru Sports Three Waters public meeting, which I attended together with a handful of other councillors  and people from the community. It was supported and led by Barbara Kuriga, Chris Luxon and Scott Simpson. Really interesting discussion with them, not just on Three Waters, but also  looking at local government reform, particularly in RMA space. So, well worthwhile going to, and unfortunately, I guess the alert levels changes have meant that perhaps more of those meetings haven't been able to be held since then. Te Umuru Community Board meeting recently, a motion was put in past requesting that the Te Arawai car park actually be known as Arawata Street car park until such stage that it becomes Te Arawai car park.  And there was also a really exciting presentation put by Gina and Brad about the skate park proposals in terms of design and collation of information around that. And really, really neat to see some of our decisions that we made at the LTP level some months ago start coming to fruition in terms of planning. And also, just following on from what Liz said, attended a Te Musu Kehekehe community leaders wellbeing group meeting,  Liz has sort of the brainchild of Liz to try and pull together people that might want to take steps or be involved in that space as a result of the COVID incursion. So yeah, despite the fact that we've all been under lockdown, I seem to have been doing a lot. So anyway, thanks very much.",

But it was a shame that we had to cancel our own three waters. I know that Elwin and Mike had put a lot of work into that. So that was a shame. So that's me. I think a lot of frustration within the community, a lot of the organisations that I'm a member of, cancelling all of their meetings, obviously, left, right and centre. So that's a shame. Good.

So, but like Mike just said, we are looking at a whole heap of other options just to try and keep the spirit, Christmas spirit alive and well in town and looking at other options and things like that with our businesses and perhaps having Santa on, having him on call, you know, just booked in. So if we can do a last minute thing,  at a smaller scale, then we'll look at that too. But we're looking at a whole heap of options. But basically, we've canned the Christmas parade on the 5th of December as it has been in the past. So we just we're just realistic. We just don't believe we can run it as it was before. So, yeah.

So look, we've got huge challenges in front of us to get that vaccination rates up across the country. So anything or any bright ideas people have got to try and encourage the  the 13 or 14% of the unvaccinated, the better. If we can do anything from a council to assist in those areas, it's obviously gonna help get back to a reasonable, I suppose, position over the Christmas and summer holidays, which is a good target to have, but really challenging at the moment. And I really can't see us shifting out of the lockdown position that we're in,  through November, the way things are shaping up. So it's going to be touch and go, really, what happens over the Christmas period. So, yeah, if there's anything we can think of, I'll come to you, Claire. We really need to turn our mind to anything that we can do to assist the Ministry of Health to up those vaccination levels. Looking at the testing in Te Amutu, a steady  I was going to say flow or trickle through.

Obviously, there was a lot of work done around Super Saturday, and I don't know if anybody's thought  much beyond that, but obviously three weeks from then, we need to try and be encouraging those people to return who are first time shooters last time. And I kind of think that we might need a bit of a run up to try and create that, not enthusiasm, but that desire or commitment to actually come for a second jab. I think we're kind of all focused on just getting jabbed, but I think we have to be quite clear about the fact that once people have had their first vaccination, we have to actually  and carry them through with it to actually complete. And I'm wondering if there's any work being done at either a DHB level or an outcomes team as to how we might craft a campaign, for want of a better word, around that, because it's hard to get people there for the first time. I think it's actually going to be harder for the second. So I was actually talking with Mandy Merson from  ComSafe yesterday and she had some quite good ideas in this space about ComSafe kind of lead, taking a role and helping along with other community groups, leading some kind of activity in that space to, you know, encourage people, enthuse people, not make it all doom and gloom, but try and make it something that's worthwhile in doing. So yeah, perhaps that's something that we can talk a bit more about offline, but I think it's something that we need to turn our minds to.",

And a lot of the stuff that's being said is said, you know, and this is the website and this is what you do and what you do.  they can't do it. And because there is a huge proportion of people out there who don't have it. And sometimes, and I think Claire's a bit right, that a fair few sit out there in our community as well.  So I think that alongside all of this, and I've even dropped a note off to the Minister of Health to say, you've also got to remember the people who haven't got like, okay, I think we have to make more use of TV and things like that, but that's,  And I think that there's a, and I know that there's actually quite a proportion of people, because from our little splurge on the other day, and also being around, you know, people who know, just ring me up and say, but what do we do? And I find out that they haven't been able to access a lot of that information. And I say, well, isn't it in the newspaper? Because a bit like them, I only get the courier  and the Te Ao Mutu news because we haven't been out and about to get the newspapers. So I think that people have to look a bit further and just remember that there are a hell of a lot of people out there who haven't got technology. And it's no good relying saying, oh, but their kids have.  Well, their kids are certainly not looking up to see what you do about it. So yeah, so I just have to say that because I'm a little weary because I spend a lot of time, not weary, but I spend a lot of time on the phone answering people's questions, or if I know where there's a problem, I ring them and we try and sort it out. So I've had to keep up with all the data myself. And I do that by listening to the  the releases each day that Jacinda and my boyfriend make. Yeah. So thanks, Jim.

So you've got in front of you in the recommendation, the final proposal there listed out based on, you know,  that recommendation. So from here, in terms of when you adopt the final proposal, we'll put an advert in the newspaper next week. On Thursday, there's then a period of at least a month where anyone that made a submission on the proposal can put in an appeal.  So that period will close on the 6th of December. And then if we get any appeals during that time, we'll send those off to the local government commission and then they will take over considering those appeals and making any other determinations on our representation arrangements.
