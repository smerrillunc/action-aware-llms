    "text": " Hi, everyone. Thank you, Madam Chair. Morning, Councillors. So, yeah, fairly quick this morning. The most topical thing of, I guess, our quarterly report is the trifecta programme, and I do note that we've got a workshop this afternoon with regards to that. So, I won't go into that in any great detail, but obviously that came at us late last year.  around, I guess, a government initiative to review this. So quite late in the piece and I guess some time pressure around completing submission with regards to that. So hence the workshop this afternoon with regard to that and to look at the change in legislation, emergency management plan and the disaster resilience strategy.  Aside from that, at a national level, so there's the NEMA Science Strategy, which is a project, a framework around science engagement. So at a local, certainly at a local level, it's welcome. So that's about giving us access to  key science or key findings that would affect our, I guess, strategic leadership and also, you know, our best practice, our management. It just gives that assurance that we're, I guess, the systems and processes that we're working under are fit for purpose and are based on the best science available. So,  That's a key strategy coming out at a national level, which would be welcomed. Moving on to, I guess, regional, I guess, through the quarter, so I've got to work around, I guess, our resilience with staffing, both with COVID response and also concurrent event and how we would manage that, both at a local level and a regional level, and obviously with  The latest Omicron is also working, as a lot of other work areas are, at a reduced capacity with staffing numbers down and how we would manage that in response to events, whether it be COVID or actually natural disasters or other events. So we've worked hard at that and at a regional level come up with planning around that, how we would support each other across councils.  You'll note in there around the bottom of page three, COVID transition. So again, just highlighting that it's been signalled that civil defence emergency management will be transitioned out of the COVID response immediate to long term as it becomes more BAU. So, and I guess we return to business as usual and preparing, I guess, responding to other emergencies.  Probably just on COVID, so obviously in the last quarter, there was certainly a response required through our Waipae area, through Te Awamutu, as we know, as we had an outbreak here. So a lot of work went into supporting health with regards to locations. The CBAC, as you're aware, was done by the Events Centre, but relied on  the library premises, which was ideal for them with everything being closed at that time. So we were able to support  support that response with council facilities and also at Kihiki, again, where testing was required. So, again, in a support role, but as previously mentioned, I guess looking that we become more and more less frequent as we move on. Who knows the future, I guess, though.  The ShakeOut exercise, again, just highlight that, October, that's an annual event. So 57 individuals, organisations registered across our Western Waikato. So that was down a little bit from, I think, the 80, but probably the timing of that in schools are usually one of our bigger uptakes with regards to that.  Other than that, and I guess kind of referring back to the workshop this afternoon, I guess that's the main sort of salient points of the quarterly report. Happy to take questions. Excellent, thanks Dave.",

My questions are around this latest COVID response, because I mean, I'm understanding  from the Ministry of Health that they're expecting more people to manage their symptoms at home. And I guess that follows on too, that there might be a greater call on your people to support them, whether it's through, I don't know, personal follow-up or food parcels and things. Like, what are your concerns about the approach that's being taken? We understand it's gonna be in the next six weeks or something,  the peak's going to happen? Yeah, I think the main concern is exactly that last one around the people and the self-isolation.",

But yeah, it's the self-isolation, checking on people, those people that don't have necessarily family to go out and do shopping, those sorts of things for them.  And we're certainly aware of that. And I guess we're in a position with our, we can respond through our welfare committees and our welfare arms. So as we did last time, we're prepared for that. Again, it's just factoring in our own, the likely abstractions.  of our own people and our own volunteers through the outbreak. But it's certainly concerning. I guess we get the assurances from Public Health Unit that they will be across that and checking that and following through. But yeah, certainly the jury's out with it and its eyes wide open from our perspective as well. And again,  if called upon, we would certainly step in and we have those processes to help through that, especially through the welfare arm. Thank you.",

Yeah, Dave, just with regards to the older members of the community and what have you and needing help.  particularly where they don't have family members in town. In the first lockdown in 2020, there was a huge amount of work that was asked for by the community. And I did a huge amount with Grey Power and all those sorts of groups, but also with the supermarket. But we found with the lockdown we had last year in the springtime,  the demand there for these families without, with these senior members of the community without families in town, the demand wasn't there. It was very minimal. So compared to the first one, there was a huge amount because it just appeared that a lot more people were prepared for it or knew what to do compared to the first one in 2020. So that's how we found it.  That was our experience anyway.",

I think the other point is, what really worked well for us through WIPO was the buddy system.  and pairing people up and those people stayed with, you know, as their buddies fall right through. What's happened is that's carried on. So those relationships are formed and even, I guess, the second time around,  there was an element of that had continued, which is fantastic, because they had made those relationships, and it was simply a matter of picking up the phone or checking in on people saying, hey, we're back into this again, you know, do we do the same thing?

So if that's OK, I'll kick off just speaking to the national regulation legislation.  So we've been really busy in terms of what central government's been sending our way. Really, really short timeframes, quick turnaround, and some of it from left field we hadn't had prior warning, as you'll appreciate. So with regard to those three submissions that were made during this quarterly period, we did engage with elected members in trying to make the best of the timeframes that we had available to us.  They are provided there, so you have a complete record. That probably leads in nicely to the RMA reforms. And in November of last year, the government published a discussion document. So there has been an internal staff team that has been convened under Wayne's leadership, looking through that discussion document and identifying  areas where the council might provide feedback. We're also collaborating with Hamilton City Council, Waikato Regional Council and Waikato District. So, the councils have agreed to share their thinking and the work that they're undertaking in this space.  So there will be a workshop with elected members on the 22nd of February, ahead of the close of submissions on the 28th of February. Moving on then to the draft future-proof strategy.  So you're aware that hearings on submissions were held at the beginning of December and that Mayor Jim was the elected member Waip\u0101 representative on that hearings panel, supported by staff, Tony and David, who were there to provide technical support to Mayor Jim on matters relating to Waip\u0101.  Tony and David have been feeding back through to the policy and planning working group of Future Proof, that's a staff group, and deliberations are scheduled to be held in March.  With regard to the NPS urban development, this will lead on and Tony will talk more specifically about the plan change that is being worked on, but work on monitoring demand and supply of development capacity is being coordinated through our Future Proof Partnership, led by Hamilton City Council. David is actively involved in that space.  and we're expecting that policies, intensification policies, will be implemented through the plan change that is being prepared. So if that's okay with you, I'll hand over to Tony and then perhaps we'll collectively respond to any questions at the end that you may have. Thank you, Tony.",

    "text": "Thanks, Kirsty. Nice hand off. So I'll pick up from here going forward.  The district plan is the next update, so E plans continuing. There was a bit of delay there just with giving our GIS system to talk to each other. We're looking at a solution for that, and so we're looking at early 2022 now as they go live for that. National directions.  You'll be well familiar with, and Kirstie's already talked about a little bit about some of the national directions, the Enabling Housing Supply Bill, which is now an Act, received Royal Assent on the 20th of December. There's a report following this update, so rather than go through this in any detail now, if it's okay, Madam Chair, I'll leave that for the next report and cover that up.  Plan Change Work Programme is still fairly full. Just a couple of updates there. Plan Change 13, we did receive two appeals on it, one relating to the C4 growth cell and one relating to the T6 growth cell. The C4 appeal has been withdrawn. Without any mediation, the appellant decided that there was no merit behind that, so it's been withdrawn. We only have one appeal, which is live relating to T6. In picking up Councillor Cole's  potential conflict of interest, just to clarify that. What that means is the rest of plan change 13 is deemed to be operative. So that's beyond challenge. So that includes live zoning, the deferred zones, which I understand is relevant in Councillor Cole's case. So just wanted to clarify that because it's beyond challenge, it's deemed to be operative. So there's only a very specific appeal subject in the T6 growth zone. We've talked about  Plan change 18, had a good discussion about that this morning. What other updates? So the plan change 19, we've got a further update on that later on to come. Plan change 23, so that's Papak\u0101inga and under the Enabling Housing Supply Act, we now are able to include Papak\u0101inga within the scope of that plan change. So what we're thinking is that rather than have two separate plan change, we'll incorporate plan change 23.  into our new Plan Change 26, which will be the Enabling Housing Supply. The Act's name for that is Intensification Planning Instruments, so they've got a generic title for all those plan changes across the country, but we've scheduled it as our Plan Change 26. And Jo's going to be reporting on some freshwater updates, so I'll leave those ones for her to update you on. I'm just looking at resource consents on page  Seven of the report that's in the agenda, so there's a couple of updates here to some applications that were recently heard and appended. There's a list of a more substantive list of the applications and progress that you might be interested in. The general story around consents is we're getting sustained increases in applications and inquiries coming through.  So the numbers are really high and at the moment around about I think 30 to 40 percent of our consents have been outsourced to consultants just because we don't have the capacity and of course being limited to budget we don't have the ability to resource as a council at peak. So we resource at kind of an average level and what we do is we use consultants to take the peak workloads. So we're still applying that process but unfortunately we've had to continue to extend our  statutory time frame, so we're allowed to double that under the RMA. That continues so that we can get through the work. And what we're seeing now is that before Christmas there was, we were pretty much inundated, so we have had consents that have gone over our statutory time frames, even with doubling. What that means is that where they go to the statutory time frame, we have to offer a refund to the applicants, and I think to date there's about $4000 as a quantum in refunds that we've we've offered back. So that's written into the RMA.  We avoid it as far as we can, but it's just, you know, unprecedented has been an overused word, but it really is. For this for this instance, unprecedented, and it's a combination of, I think, the national direction. Developers wanted to take advantage of that. Growth cells being opened up, so some developers wanting to move on those. And I don't think COVID's had too much of an impact on this other than  There just seems to be a general groundswell of applications coming through. LIMS. Similarly, we're getting sustained and increasing queries through LIMS. Infrastructure development, so that's the same. A lot of workload there to go through and a lot of it relates to setting up the growth cells which are coming online and making sure we've got the infrastructure right for when they become developed.  We've got some references there to the airport area. There is a private plan change that we're expecting in March for that. And just a high level summary of all the gross sales on page 8 of the report. They're all appended, so if you want any more details, they're in the appendix. Building compliance. Carl's here. So Carl, did you want to cover off any of the building compliance highlights?",

And I know that Te Pahu locals have been quite upset about this burning of regenerating native bush.  and what's going to be done about it.

    "text": "Thank you. Happy to share what I know on that one. So that related to the unlawful spraying of a significant natural area. Well, it would have been about probably three or four years ago now.  It's multi-jurisdictional, so it was a discharge to air which was permitted under the regional rules, I understand. But because it was an SNA, then it wasn't permitted under our land use rules. So to answer the question, we've been waiting on the applicant. They've been promising that they'll come back to us with further information response. I do feel it's a very timely question. I have raised with the team whether they're delaying tactics on behalf of the applicant.  And it's a really interesting one, so we've been asked to consider a resource consent for retrospective clearance. And so. If the application is granted, then that means retrospectively, you know there was lawful activity, but if it's declined, the vegetation is gone. So what can we do with that? So one of the things that we're looking at with the applicant is regeneration. They have a proposal in  to regenerate some of that land with Pinus radiata. And so if it was declined, that would probably mean that we would require them to reinstate with native vegetation to replace what was lost. So the team is talking about that and we are looking at whether we actually up the ante a little bit. There was an enforcement action that we had to put on them because the application hadn't come in, it's come in now.  So thank you for raising that, and I'm happy to take that back to the team to see if we can get some action on that. Thank you very much.",

    "text": " Yep, I'll just continue through monitoring and enforcement just quickly. So some of the highlights there, and I think in terms of the discussion around the animal bylaw this morning, some of the figures there, so 120 complaints, of which approximately 90, 95 related to parking and littering. So that gives you an idea of the other  complaints that fit into that space, some of which would relate to animals. Four littering ones. They're significant in the sense that we were actually able to identify offenders and issue infringement notices there, which is good work by the team to do that. And yeah, we had a period of time where we were essentially back to normal with parking notices. That's possibly changed again under the move to red light.  Animal Control, a fairly consistent month in terms of numbers and the types of jobs coming into that team. Again, probably the notable thing here is two attacks that have been deemed to be on the more serious end of the scale.  Both of those dogs have been euthanised and council will be looking at what other action, if any, is needed to be taken in those cases. And interesting to note that both of them started as incidents between dogs. So I'll be looking at whether that relates to use of exercise areas and council reserves, that sort of thing as part of that process. Very good progress in terms of chasing up dog registrations, despite limitations on actually going and visiting people.  and impounding numbers down, if anything, overall. Environmental health. Again, nothing too out of the ordinary there. We are still dealing with a number of premises that have either reduced their trading or stopped trading due to COVID related matters or have simply not renewed or paid fees. So that accounts for most of the changes there in terms of the number of premises that we're dealing with rather than premises disappearing.  There was the alcohol license decision in relation to the Blue Drop store in Victoria Street in Cambridge that most of you will be familiar with. And the team are just highlighting there a couple of other new licenses that were granted and a couple of others that are on the way. So the Ahalpo drink station has a preliminary  hearing in a couple of weeks time, looking at the status of the public objectives that have come in for that one, with two hearing days allocated later in the month. Noise control, considering it was the Christmas period, stats there again, fairly consistent on previous years, and as well as one stereo being seized. It's not noted here, but I'll update it. There were also two infringement notices issued.  for $500 each for people that failed to comply with directions to stop noise where police weren't available to issue seizures. And just noting there, we're looking at the local alcohol policy review, which will be due at some stage this year.",

So I get a check and sure enough, there is no sign there. So I suggested to Ken that the CBDs in Te Amuru and Cambridge need a really good look at in terms of, I mean, you can't have a sign 60 meters down the road and expect people at the 59 or at number one to see where the parking is. And some of them have moved  and leaving spaces of up to 10 parks. So, the 10 parks, you could be there all day and you can't be ticketed. So, I'm just saying something needs to happen for that enforcement to really take effect in the CBD. Thanks. Greg Morgan Cool.",

One is to, I guess, introduce you to some of the thinking around shaping up what this plan change might look like. So, there's a number of decisions that will need to be made around that. So, this is an introductory report in that sense.  But also this plan changes unfunded and not budgeted. So we are asking for some budget and that's one of the recommendations that's come through as well. So if we just hit the high points, I guess, again, on page two of the report, the Act has come out and it has some changes from the bill. So it does specify now us as a specified council. So that's been confirmed.  It clarifies that the medium density residential standards apply to all residential zones in towns greater than 5,000 people. So that's obviously Cambridge and Te Aumuru. A question came up, does that include Kehekehi? We don't quite have an answer for that yet because there's, it's not a contiguous urban boundary between, or it's not a contiguous urban area between Kehekehi and Te Aumuru at the moment. T6 is a bridge between that, and that's not fully developed yet.  So we're not quite sure what the answer to that is at the moment, but there'll be some more research on that we're doing. It's broadened the scope to what we can include in mandatory plan changes. So it now includes some things that weren't in there previously, and there's opportunity within that. So let's turn to page three. What we tried to do, because we've got plan change 21, which we have budgeted and always anticipated doing, is we thought it'd be useful to put a table in that shows the scope of how we think the two different plan changes will shake down.  So that's on table one on page three of the report. So the medium density residential standards, that's obviously part of plan change 26, which is the intensification planning instrument given effect to the NPS urban development that's included. Papak\u0101inga housing, as I mentioned earlier, what we think we'll do is take a separate plan change and incorporate that into the intensification planning instrument. And financial contributions, so there's an opportunity to review and strengthen those as well.  Just going down that right hand column, the urban design wasn't something that featured in the original bill, but the feedback from MFE is that they have heard the feedback and it appears that they're now going to be requiring an urban design guideline to be included in all plan changes. Which is better than nothing, but guidelines can be a little bit difficult to implement because they are only guidelines, so we're still waiting for the legislation to come out to actually see what that means.  In the final- I think they were talking about, Tony, I think they were talking the other day, one of the reports was larger windows.",

And the last thing that's on scope is consequential amendments, so that could be quite broad in terms of what that means for our plan. Then if we look at plan change 21, so large lot zones is out of scope of the government plan change.  We've got a piece of work that we will be reporting back on Plan Change 21 around large lot zones with the scope to intensify some of those. We do have the ability in Plan Change 21 to strengthen the urban design rules across the district. Affordable housing is something that Plan Change 21 still has within scope. Inclusionary zoning, there's quite a lot of interest in that across all the different councils. Character areas, so we have a very few of those at the moment. And in order to help shape up  the enabling housing plan change, we're starting to think it might be a good idea to do a review of our character areas across Te Aumutu and Cambridge to see if there's any new areas that we need to include in there.

In terms of any infrastructure upgrades that might be needed,  Again, there's a bit of a dilemma for all councils, and we're in this as well, because if we get permitted intensification that's not currently built into our DC revenue, then we've got no legal means of recovering it, which is why we think the government has said you can look at your financial contributions. So it's different development contributions. Development contributions are things that are planned and foreseen.  This has lumped us with something that no one saw coming.

    "text": "Which takes us nicely on to table two, it's on page four.  This is very high level. It's best guessed, and it's based on sort of collective experience of what we think it could cost to do the plan changes, and there's two, three scenarios really. At the bottom there, if staff do only one in four, so that's the scoping, the preparing, and the submissions analysis, and we get consultants to do the sort of expert components, then we're looking around about $190,000.  If we ended up not having capacity and we still got to make some calls around that and we needed to get consultants to do the entire thing, then we're looking about 320,000. The third scenario is that there's a possibility of some joint work done with our future peer partners, so that's Hamilton and Waikato District. We've already had preliminary discussions with them and at staff level at least, and we know that at Hamilton City at political level there is a willingness to  join up where we can. The areas that we think we can join up on are possible use of shared experts to input, joint public notice, and there's only small dollars involved in that. But the main substantive area that we think we could collaborate on is a joint hearing. So all councils in the country are required to appoint independent commissioners. We're not allowed to appoint councillor commissioners. And those commissioners then hear these government plan changes, which are implemented through the councils.  So we thought between the three of us we could have a combined panel. So the thinking is three separate plan changes, because all the plans are different and all the needs are different, but we'd potentially have one expert panel. We'd agree on who those experts could be. There's probably likely be a TK component in there that we need to put in as well. And then those commissioners would hear all three plan changes separately, ideally one after another, but the timing might not quite work out.  So we think there's advantages in that, not only from cost, but also from consistency. So if we've got the same commissioners hearing the plan change across the three different councils, they'll be able to see across them any consistency, for example, things like definitions or things that might come through. So that's the work in progress, and I guess one of the things I'd be keen today would be just to see if there's any  political appetite to go down that track of collaborating at staff level. As I said, at Hamilton City Council elected member level, there is interest in doing that, so I'm keen to get some feedback on that. And then the last bit, just to cover off is the implementation. So if you go to the last page, which is page six, there's a bit of an indicative timeline there of how we think Plan Change 21 and Plan Change 26 might track.  Ideally we do them concurrently, but that depends on our staff resources and we've got a number of plan changes on the go, so we might have to look at how we do that. But we have a deadline for Plan Change 26. We have to, under the new Act, notify that by the 20th of August this year. And of course we've got elections in there as well, so we need to factor that in. The only other considerations to bring to your attention there is Plan Change 21. All the Council plan changes don't have legal effect.  until they've gone through the hearings and a final decision has happened. The government's changed that with the intensification plan change, so that has legal effect on the date of notification. We've already had queries from one subdivision company on behalf of a number of clients saying we're really keen to know what the council is doing because when you notify, we're ready to go. We've got clients who are ready to  And so we've got some speculative behavior already happening out in the community, so we're trying to just cool it down a little bit because the last thing we need is people or developers anticipating something which might be different than what we end up with.

Because we've got some development, this is from the COO, we've got developer clients who are strategically starting to look at where they could go. And the second part of that was if we were to put in non compliant applications now, how would Council proceed with those?  We pushed back on that a little bit, so what we said is it's too premature and Council hasn't made any decisions around where these areas could or could not be, and we can cover that off a little bit further in the district plan update report that's coming up as well. And in response to the non-compliant activity query, what we said there is we'd advise caution and we advise against any sort of speculative non-compliant resource consents coming in at this point ahead of us.  putting out a plan change to identify these areas could be. It'll run through the normal consent process for receiving any of those. It's a bit interesting because we've got the legislation now that says we have to put some weight on the medium density residential standards, but what we don't have is any idea where those could be in our district. And so if we get any of those applications coming through, it'll be quite an interesting one to process.

I don't want Waipahu to be spending ratepayers' money when this is a environment Waikato issue. We also report to them. There's a whole lot of mechanisms there that we can't do.  The insinuations here about bad practices are few and far between in terms of bad practices. And to have fish passage is like, it's just over the top stuff. Forage crops, restricted intensification. What's intensification? 5,000 cows in a big barn trucking in feed? Don't know. Synthetic fertilizer, well, you strategically put on  nitrogen fertilizer in the absolute best possible conditions to get the best uptake. All that and the amount we use is with our fertilizer company, Balancing Anchorage Nutrients. And so they can all be taken into account without going down this road. But I'm loathe to say that I don't think it'll get any traction. They're already set in their ways and this is what happens.
