I'm, as Hannah says, thank you, Hannah, for the lovely introduction. Here as Development Manager, but more so presenting to you as the Interim General Manager of Hamilton and Waikato Tourism. Been around for a little while, so shouldn't be a strange face to some of you. So nice to see you all on Zoom. This is the Hamilton Waikato Tourism six-month report, so covering July through to December last year.  So it seems a little while ago, so we'll just reflect on what's been happening. I'm gonna share screen because I do have some slides just to keep me on track and make sure that I'm covering all that I need to cover. So hopefully it's bounced up now. And of course, you've got my report already in your agenda pack.  So first up, because it is six months of last year and we're already, gosh, almost most of the way through March, I thought we'd just reflect on what those six months looked like. It's quite easy in this changing time to lose, I guess, what levels and colors and 0.3s and 0.2s we were at. So of the six months, July, we had a lot of freedom. We were out and we were living life and we were enjoying ourselves.  And then of course, Delta arrived on our shores and that launched us all as a country into Level 4 lockdown. I'm sure we all remember that. September, Auckland remained in Level 4 and we were lucky enough to go down to Level 3 and then to 2 and have three weeks of what was called Level 2 Delta. So a little bit of freedom, which was really only short-lived, wasn't it? We were launched fairly quickly back into Level 3.  in October and most of November. While that was part of Waikato and I think Cambridge was skirting on being part of that first initial piece and then was included a couple of weeks later, may have only been a week. So having lockdown with our residents, our own residents who account for a lot of  travel within our region and Auckland, our largest domestic market, there's absolutely no doubt that there has been a massive impact on our visitation, which leads to visitor spend and bed nights. Tourism events and hospitality, all sectors have been gravely impacted. So I just thought we should reflect on that. It's easy just to keep moving on and overlook where we've actually come from.  So these figures are all in your report and agenda pack, but I thought it would be worthwhile just reflecting on these. These are the highlights for Waikato as a region, so not Waipara, I'll go into those next. Waikato as a region achieved $662 million worth of tourism electronic card transactions. Now that's different to, we used to talk about visitor spend from the old monthly tourism regional estimate data that comes out of MBIE.  Those old data sets made an assumption and an estimate and a best guess, like calculated guess, scientific guess, on online spend and cash contribution as well. That's no longer available through MBIE. They provide this instead. So this is only electronic card at point of sale. So when we swipe our visa, that's what comes through.  So 662 million. They have given us the backwards data to 2019 on that same data set. So we are able to see the comparisons. So we're still maintaining around fifth place ranking in New Zealand and around 5% of that domestic spend, which is normal and pre-COVID levels as well.  Guest nights, so that's 900, 700,000 commercial guest nights in our region for the 12 months. So about three and a half percent market share. So fairly in line with where we've always been. Overall regional occupancy rate was 35.7. So we were okay.  The business event data that I've got here is only for quarter three, so it's only three months of this six-month report, unfortunately. The data has not come out in time for us. 128 business events hosted, hosting 12,000 delegates. Now we know that delegates who come to our business events on average spend more than our leisure market and often will return. The rest of that is more New Zealand data and it's all in your pack.  leave that one there. So for Waip\u0101, these graphs are also in your pack, but I thought we'd touch base on these as well. Commercial accommodation at 38% occupancy for Waip\u0101 district. So these are hotels, motels, backpackers and holiday parks.  That's 38%, so New Zealand's average occupancy rate is 37. So just picking up a little bit more than the New Zealand national rate, which is fantastic. 1.9 average nights stayed per guest, so that helps with the occupancy, and 149,000 guest nights there. And you'll recall that was of Waikato's 907,000 guest nights.  The visitor spend there of the same tourism electronic card transactions is 131 million into Waip\u0101. So you can see that while Waikato-Web is sometimes doing okay as a region, Waip\u0101 actually pips it and is actually growing and is doing really well of our six districts. Okay.  This next slide just reiterates all of the activity that we've been doing for the six months. So you've got paragraphs on most of these and details of these in your agenda pack. So while we've only had one month of the five with visitors able to travel, our team have been still keeping very busy and activating the visitation, keeping Waikato and Waipa top of mind. You'll recall the Mighty Local campaign  that we kicked off during lockdown, the original lockdown of 2020, was to activate our locals and getting out and supporting and buying food, beverage, supplies, whatever it might've been for lockdown locally. We've reinvigorated that in August to make sure that we're still keeping that message the same, loud and clear, locals please support local. That campaign continues now with some tweaks, even in red,  that while we're in red, it is safe to travel. You might not feel comfortable getting on a plane or whatever it is, but it is safe to travel within our region and go and explore and see our local offerings, our tourism operators, and get out there and be in our hospitality venues and support our local operators. So that keeps going now.  We've been checking a lot. I'm just looking at my notes to make sure I cover everything. During each of the lockdowns in red, we spend a lot of time, our team, on the phone and emails and connecting with our operators, just checking to see how they are. It's a little bit of a health check. How are you and how can we help? How can we support? Sometimes it's just helping them navigate how to access the subsidies available, but it's all with a view of supporting them, making sure that they're there,  for when we can have visitors very soon, that everyone's ready for that action. Well, we've had closed borders and we've got a little bit of a light at the end of the tunnel now. Our team do keep working within the international markets. We have not been ignoring that just because our borders are closed. So we've been doing quite a bit of training with travel agents, international travel agents, with travel media, making sure that  that Waikato and Waipa are still top of mind for them. So that keeps working. And with our border reopening being announced in the last just couple of weeks, that has really been accelerated even further. We've got a lot of travel trade activity happening at the moment.  We've talked before about STAT, so the Strategic Tourism Asset Protection Funding and the Tourism Reset Funding that central government issued to all RTOs. We maximized what we were able to apply for with those, with both of those. And that's really helped to accelerate some of those key projects that we had in our Tourism Opportunities Plan previous. And it's helped to offset a little bit of our partnership money has been a little bit light in the last little while,  operators have not been able to help and contribute to our activity so that those central government funds have helped to fill that gap as well and keep us working very hard for our region.  That's really all that I wanted to go through as terms of a presentation and allow plenty of time for Q&As. So all that I really need to say at the end of there is thank you for your ongoing support. Our relationships with our funding councils is really appreciated and we appreciate your ongoing commitment.",

And at the moment, the data from MBIE, they prefer that we don't break it into domestic and international.  for the reason being that a lot of returning New Zealanders have come into the country and are using their international bank card. They've come home with their UK bank card, using that to spend, and that is actually coming through as international spend, but it's actually not. So yeah, hope that helps. Thank you.",

And I think we're going to start, we are going to see a really good upcoming summer season, which is really pleasing. But I guess one of the things I'm just a bit worried about, I'm interested in your thoughts on around Waip\u0101 in particular,  our tourism providers dealing with COVID. So, you know, we are starting to see COVID seep through our staffing levels. Are you aware of any issues around businesses that, you know, just might be really struggling to keep up with the pace that's now apparent?  and the inability to, I guess, perform because, you know, their own staff are struggling or, you know, getting COVID and having to isolate and get well. Is there something we should be or could be doing in that space, Nicola? It's certainly something we could explore, absolutely.",

I don't have a magic answer really at the moment, Liz, but it's certainly something we need to be aware of. Yeah, and I think just to reach out, Nicola, as a council, we have had sort of a COVID relief fund there, not too sure how that may or may not work, but yeah, I guess just let us know if there's anything that you feel that we could be doing to support in this space.",

    "text": "Thanks, Councillor Brown. And afternoon, Council and Mayor Jim. Look, I've also got Scott Kendall joining me, who is our group GM Finance. And look, this afternoon, you obviously have to hand our draft Statement of Intent  and our six-month interim results through to December. So we're taking those as read, and really we've just got three or four slides given the time to just give you a quick update on the RAO group. So, firstly, it's been an interesting six-month period, and we're just bringing up, if we can just go back a slide, sorry, Scott, just to the initial introductory slide.  Look, it has been a very tough six months result trading for us. Ironically, though, July and December were record months and we recovered very quickly after those, particularly Delta, the aeronautical business recovered very quickly. Scott will talk about this current six month period, which is  been quite a different story. But look, overall, we were pretty pleased with the results for that six-month period given COVID. And yet again, I think we have seen, whilst we've had trading volatility with the airport, we've seen much more solid operations with the hotel,  obviously, as an MIQ during this period, and also the property investment and development strategy working very well. So if we go to the next slide, the  As I say, passenger traffic, the disruption was relatively minimal and sort of contained to about the first month or so after each of those periods of lockdown or level three. And fortunately, that bounce back kept us there or thereabouts as at the end of December on track for our full year.  The terminal resilience project, most of you will be aware, of course, that we are in the middle of quite a significant redevelopment. So this is a $15 million project on the terminal. During this reporting period, it has gone very well. We're fortunate that most of the significant costs associated with the project were pre-purchased  and now we were operating on a relatively fixed term contract. So we've been relatively insulated in this period around costs and the project generally was there or thereabouts on project. We are seeing some delays in January, February as a result of COVID hitting particularly the subcontracting trades.  We're managing to keep the project moving forward, but we are probably now about six weeks, six to eight weeks behind. And we would expect to catch some of that up, but we now would expect to probably have the terminal finished in September or October of this year when we would reverse the operations back into what was the original terminal.  The finalisation of all the fit out is happening as we speak, all of the carpets, so the flooring, the bathroom tiles, ceiling tiles, all of those elements have been selected. We have engaged with Norm Hill, so there's a full cultural evaluation of the terminal.  and we have engaged a cultural artist to assist with the look and feel of the terminal, both internally and externally. And in fact, we have a major update to the board in early April just on that cultural narrative and how that will weave into the terminal design.  Finally, on the northern precinct, you will be aware that late last year, your council signed off the major transaction, which was really the trigger to submit the private plan change, which of course is with Waip\u0101.  That plan change has been delayed two or three weeks due to some late technical information arriving to our project team. But the intention is to submit the PPC either very late this week or early next week. And of course, we've been heavily engaged  with your management team and with the independent commissioners, et cetera, that will hear that private plan change. So there's been a very big piece of work. We obviously have the memorandum of understanding signed and agreed with the Yates family. So we are bringing 130 hectares into the plan change application.  very comfortable with the engagement we've had sitting with your council and with Waka Kotahi in particular around the ITA and ensuring the transportation issues are dealt with. So we're in good shape to lodge that and of course, as you will know, that process will take the rest of this year and into probably early next year. I'll now hand over to Scott.",

    "text": " Thanks, Mark. Good afternoon, everyone. So I'm thinking, I guess, looking ahead to what the next six months initially brings us for the balance of the financial year. I think, as Mark mentioned earlier, we came back really strong to have a record December, and that's flowed through January as well. Obviously, as the country moved to the red alert level and a number of events got cancelled through the past couple of months, we saw pretty well straight away about a 30%, 40% drop in passenger traffic.  That has probably peaked at about a 50% drop and we've seen the past couple of weeks a couple of steady increases and some really positive signs looking ahead into April for board bookings coming through. So I hope that the worst is behind us and we'll let we see that sort of recovering pretty well back to normal sometime by 30 June.  Yeah, and look, I think our forecasting as it is indicates we'll still get close to budget. So certainly the aeronautical business has suffered this year, the Delver outbreak and then of course Omicron. But I think we've obviously had the benefit of the MyQ hotel that's continued on a bit longer than we thought. So that has, that'll get us pretty well on with net square with budget. Although I use the analogy, it looks very different. What's gone into the blender and what's come out look very different, but we've still got the same result.  So, no concerns at all around weakened capital or anything like that at the moment.  In terms of business continuity and critical services that we do, naturally the way, particularly our critical services and rescue fire operate, they work in bubbles. And to date, we've been in a really good position. We've had good supply of rat testing things coming through. And we've had a good, I guess, safe workforce and very few case numbers to report. So no risk to continuity. We've done a lot of modeling around that. We could potentially have 60 or 70%  absenteeism in our rescue fire service and we'd still be at a point where we can cover all critical or flights or scheduled flights with a minimum level of cover and that's without sort of needing to get exemptions or short-term absences. So really confident we're in a good position there and certainly what we've seen so far is hopefully the worst is behind us.  So, Jet Park Hotels, you should be aware, hopefully, early last month, in February, just became the Mohia Community Facility, so that was relocated from the Distinction Hotel in Hamilton City. It's been fluctuating between about a quarter full and half full with positive cases, so these are people where they cannot safely isolate at home due to household circumstances, so the hotels are available for that. That contract originally was for 31 December,  And I know many of you will have heard through the media that, in effect, with the borders opening, MIQ is winding up rather quickly. We expect that our contract will take us partly through the winter. I guess there's some cautiousness at a central government level around outbreaks and that interacting seasonal flu. So we're expecting that we will have the hotel contracted with as an MIQ facility, although not a border facility, through to about the end of June.  at which time there'll be a brief outage for a couple of months. There's obviously still a few rooms that needed upgrading from when we took it over that we weren't able to complete before COVID. And the hotel's been used in a much more intense capacity in a much different way to help hotels and businesses for use. So there's a few new finishings, new beds, a bit of a spruce up that's needed. So that  and we're hoping to be back in the market somewhere around the end of September, early October as another trading hotel obviously to support the Waikato region in general being located where we are between Hamilton and of course the two major towns in Waipa.  Just in terms of our organisation and our people, we have seen the business evolve a little bit, and you're obviously aware of Northern Precinct, and that's quite a significant step change in property. So we have, in addition to Mark and myself, we've just welcomed a new general manager.  for the airport so Ben Langley joins us having had a career with Sounds Air originally and more recently Ardmore Flying School. So Ben is replacing many of you may know Simon Hollinger who's leaving us at the end of this week after 23 years with the airport company.  So then also with property, we're recruiting a new general manager of property as well. So that's also quite an exciting evolution for us. We've had an in-house property team, but it's more around a project delivery. So this brings a greater degree of, I guess, strategic leadership to our property and certainly to interact with the aeronautical businesses. We're seeing our property opportunities that straddle both aeronautical and commercial property interests.  So that's a really good sign for us moving forward. Just in terms of staff wellbeing, we made the call last year to move to be a living wage employer. So now in the hotel, across our group, so particularly in the hotel and the airport retail space, we are now a living wage employer. And we're doing generally a lot more just around staff wellbeing and development and things now. So it's something I guess we've talked a lot about and we're now on a bit of a journey to actually do things that are meaningful.  So that kind of will take us through to 30 June, and then just looking, I guess, more broadly, 2023 and beyond. So, yes, really now to our statement of intent. And fundamentally, our statement of intent that you've seen, there's no substantial change in direction of travel to what has been signed off in our 10-year strategy, and ultimately, in the previous recent statement of intent, there's obviously still a refreshed COVID lens there.  But we're very much on track with our 10-year strategy and still benchmarking ourselves against that. So probably for the first time in a decade, we're actually going to see some aeronautical development around the airline business. So we've sold a number of properties on Titanium Park that are call it airside, so they do bound the current airport boundary.  And we've had quite a bit of interest for corporate jet operators to wanting to relocate their jets out of Auckland or indeed new operators that can't get hangarage in Auckland. So in addition to the land transaction, we're investing in infrastructure. This is quite significant size taxiway developments.  under our long-term master plan and of course what we have to protect the runway in a future potential long haul runway extension this is sort of infrastructure that will fold up into that so in time we see this development being able to connect the taxiway with the end of the runway to the terminal that we don't currently have  But yeah, first time certainly since we welcomed L3 to Hamilton Airport a number of years ago that we've made a significant investment in the non-urban local part of the business. There's also work on a new helicopter precinct that's subbing into the airport, so we'll have many of you aware there's a corporate helicopter hangar facility at the moment.  and we're seeing a new maintenance space being built just to the south of that second half of the year. There's still a lot of work going on the runway designation so look that does allow us to extend the runway in time up to three kilometres. It has about another five years to run.  but there is obviously a plan we need to have in place to either give effect to that designation or seek an extension, and of course you are the territorial authority for that. So we're doing some works behind the scenes, RMA review, refresh technical reports. When this was consented to and the process went through, sort of started 15 years ago, the world looked very different with 747s and A380s that COVID has seen the accelerated retirement of.  So it's important to us to actually understand what the aspirations were in 2006 when this journey started, and how much of that's achievable with new aircraft technology, new navigation technology, and just the aircraft that are out there. And it may be that  you know there's a shorter runway can still deliver what was intended to be delivered um you know connections into Asia and North America that's that's highly likely to be achievable with um some of the infrastructure we have and we know there's case studies of that um around the world as to what called Airbus A350s and Dreamliners can operate off in the distance as they can fly so doing a lot of work there just to inform ourselves um and there's obviously an ongoing piece of um engagement with um  our shareholders and ourselves as our territorial authority going forward. In the sustainability space, again a bit like the wellbeing, we've gone from putting some words on a page to actually doing some really positive stuff about it.  So there's an international airport accreditation scheme. There's currently four levels to it. Very few airports have got to level one. That's sort of getting you put on the ladder. And it's really, for us, it's about just understanding our mission. So a plan to, I guess, understand what they are and measure and report them. We're doing that.  That's in line with a lot of emerging regulation and reporting requirements around climate change and things that are coming through. So we got a Level 1 certification last year and we're progressing to Level 2 as quick as we can. Now Level 2 is not just more technical reports and more analysis, there's actually a time frame in it because we have to go through a process that shows over time  we've reduced our emissions and understandably COVID and decreased passenger volumes has put quite a disruption on that. So we're working as good as we can, but it's not something that we'll necessarily get overnight. And the other end of the spectrum, Christchurch is one of the first airports in the world to be level four. So there is precedent for New Zealand airports doing very well. So I do have a question there from Councillor Pettit.",

    "text": " It's something we have looked into. I think once we get a full picture of what our emissions are, and I guess at an airport, the airport company is a relatively small part of, call it the ecosystem of emissions. There's things like fuel burning and that, which aircraft do. So for us, I think at the next stage, part of level two, and as we look at level three, is actually understanding what our true carbon footprint is.  But some of the things we are doing behind the scenes is we're actually looking at solar and energy optimisation. So one of it is actually, how can we use less electricity? And that's very simple as part of the TRP, thermal upgrade, LED lighting, that sort of technology is going in. But it's also future-proofing ourselves around, we have a lot of surplus land and not all of it can be developed for a business park. There's plenty of land that you can't build a tall building on, but we can put a solar farm on and it's very,  credible and even yesterday presentation internally so a very credible case business case for solar farm development I think that would be step one definitely and yeah offsetting carbon credits is something we had definitely talked about but it's yeah it's probably  Before we made a call on that, it's understanding what our true carbon footprint is and that a lot of our key providers as well. So you obviously come to an airport and you talk to check-in staff and baggage handlers and things, and a lot of that's through the airline. So it's a bit more than just saying, is the airport carbon neutral, truly? Well, the airport company might be, but the airport as a whole might not be. So I think we'd like to do some more work before we made a statement like committing to offsetting carbon.  Things like that. So it's also part of the energy optimization as being EV, electric vehicle charging, future proof. Obviously at a supermarket, people go, plug their car in, they tend to get a fast charge for 20 minutes, get their groceries and go home. Airports are a little more challenging.  If we have five charging ports, the first five electric cars turn up on a Monday morning to plug their cars in. Their owners get on a plane and go to Wellington for three days or a week of meetings or family goes on holiday. So there's obviously there are five charges to five cars as well, but they're plugged in for a week. So that's something we're still navigating, but it's also, as we future-proof ourselves, it's something we're focused on.  definitely growing market. So, and that leads into other opportunities as well, around the services we offer and can we offer like a valet parking. So the cars are charged when people get home. And then also public transport. So we do have that on demand bus service now as well. So it's another, I guess, economic from a consumer's point of view, and also from an edge optimization, if you can send one bus with 10 people, it's a lot better than 10 shipped cars going out.  So some really good stuff in that space happening. And I guess just our future property development. So Central Precinct, which is between the airport terminal and Pacific Aerospace, for those of you familiar with the airport.  The fifth stage is currently under construction. That has with it those airside sections I talked about earlier. So we expect those transactions to settle in about August or September. And that is quite a large release of capital at a time where the heavy spend on the terminal is nearing an end. So that keeps the ballot sheet nice and tidy and the cash flow management really good. It does put a spike in our 2023 earnings as well.  And after that, I think we'll see a couple of quieter years in terms of trading profit until Northern Precinct's underway. And the beauty is to have, within the 2025 financial year, the first land sales there.",

We are in the process, in fact, Kim will receive a letter back from the airport company later this week or very early next week. So we have had a discussion with the board. And I think, look, it has been well noted. I guess the challenge that we need to consider is that  that the company will need somewhere in the order of $15 to $20 million to develop stage one of Northern Precinct. So I think we're in a position where the current  earnings both and that will be a combination of course of cash flow and debt funding for stage one. Now we would hope to sell sufficient land to help fund that.

    "text": "I think we agree that, and going back through the history of why that money was invested, it was invested obviously to facilitate, you know, as part of a titanium part.  and it is maturing, but I think it's that important hump to get through the next couple of years until Northern's up and running and it's self-sustainable. Obviously, the difference, I guess, from where we've been in the property strategy has been typically funding, restructuring capital to fund the airport.  Hopefully now the airport, and it's come through COVID, and I think that's been a good test that the airport is pretty sustainable in that regard. You know, we've got sprung with the seismic issue on the building, and that's gonna cost us 15 million, which, you know, look at a lot of other airports around the country have had to knock on the friendly shareholder's door, so we haven't had to do that. So I think, look, step one has been get the airport in order. That's done. There's a lot of confidence around that going forward. And once we're over the hump in Northern, you know, the initial capital outlay,  then I think yeah it's really around generating a sustainable and recurring income.  The challenge, of course, with land sales that we've had this surplus land to date is we've sold the land, we've realised the capital, what next? So now the airport's sustainable, Northern's up and running. That's, as I was saying, 2025, probably the first sales come through. And I think definitely after that point, it's not lost on us that if we're generating a sustainable and recurring income, there needs to be a pass back to the shareholders and obviously acknowledge the reason why the capital was invested.",

But look, the challenge and what we saw Jetstar undertake a regional network and we were part of bidding for that back in just prior to me starting in 2015, 14, 15.  And the challenge you have, and that was that was unsuccessful pre-COVID. So regional competition is very challenging.  you've got Jetstar that's re-entering the national, you know, the main trunk routes in competition with Air New Zealand. But I think what we will see, and COVID of course has shifted the dial yet again, and I don't really see, I see regional  Airlines such as Origin, Sun Air, Sounds Air, Air Chathams, those sorts of airlines will provide services to certain locations. But I don't foresee a period where there will be, if you like, a major competitor airline on regional routes. There just isn't the population base to make it profitable. And you're tending to operate aircraft  that are less seats on board. Therefore, the airfares are more expensive. Therefore, low-cost airlines don't tend to be attracted to regional routes. So it's a challenge. Our role is to try and grow, particularly Origin Air, and to try and make sure that we... And we started back just... Origin had just launched the Hamilton to Hawke's Bay service.  just prior to this latest, so late last year. So their intention, of course, then you could fly an Origin from here to Palmerston North to Hawke's Bay on to Wellington or Nelson. So there is a desire, but I don't underestimate the challenge.",

But look, one of the challenges, as you say, for electric is that it's 19 seats or less at the moment, and it's less than a couple of hundred nautical miles. So flying from Hamilton to even Wellington isn't that achievable with electric as the technology currently stands.  But look, sounds there are about to, there'll be some trialing over the next few years. In New Zealand's view is that there will probably be regional electric aircraft later this decade, maybe around 2030 or maybe slightly before. And the other key aspect is whether or not it's electric  and or hydrogen as the other fuel that has been closely considered globally. There's a lot more complexity around hydrogen being able to compress it sufficiently to carry enough on board. But work is going on in that space. Both solutions require massive airport infrastructure to accommodate those alternative fuels, not insurmountable, but reasonably expensive.  And therefore, that also has to come into the mix. So look, and then long haul, there's still no alternative long haul. Some biofuel development, they think, but fundamentally, no one's seeing any change to long haul out till 2050, almost. So it's an emerging technology, something that I don't think we'll see out of the Waikato before the 2030s.",

    "text": " Firstly, if I can just touch on the operating profit for the six months to 31st of December. So the profit was $5.9 million. So you can see that's consistent with  previous years and also the outlook going forward. So while profits are important to LGFA in respect that they will build the equity base going forward, and that's good for you as a shareholder and guarantor in LGFA, they're probably not the primary focus of LGFA.  The biggest challenge, I think, when I look back over the last two years, is just the significant amount of volatility in global financial markets. So going back a couple of years, we saw risk aversion as a result of COVID. We've seen the start of  central bank tightenings and a lot of global inflationary pressures. And in the last sort of six weeks, we've seen the geopolitical risk coming out of the war in Ukraine. And just, you know, to illustrate just how, you know, the risk aversion that investors have now, you know, for example, if China started  providing some sort of support to Russia and New Zealand companies couldn't trade with China anymore. You know, the  risk for the change in the financial outlook for a company like Fonterra would just change so quickly. So you can see that's what investors are thinking about. As a consequence, LGFA has put a lot of emphasis on building a strong amount of liquidity. So we used to have around $500 million of liquid assets.  to support sort of future lending for councils, we're now holding around sort of $2.5 billion of financial assets. So that will enable us to lend to councils for a significant period of time, even if we went through a period where we couldn't issue any more bonds into financial markets ourselves.  So that comes at a financial cost. So, you know, we have to issue debt and invest that money in high quality assets. So we don't make any money out of doing that. But that's just to sort of illustrate that that is really the the key consideration of LGFA directors is just ensuring we're able to meet the financial requirements of councils and in the most cost effective manner that we can.  In terms of our objectives, one of the ticks we've got that I'd just like to highlight is the  Annual survey we do with councils and we target an 85% satisfaction score. We now have 74 member councils with another three in the process of joining. So that will take us to 77. So the only non-council member will be Chatham Island. So we have had extremely strong support from the council sector.  And the satisfaction rate, this is an anonymous survey for the 12 months to June 21, was just over 99%. So hopefully that  provides some sort of illustration that our member councils are happy with that we're meeting their financial requirements. The two objectives that we didn't meet is the first one was achieving an 80% market share. The issue we've got there is Auckland make up over 50% of total council debt in New Zealand.  And if we met, if LGFA met all of Auckland Council's borrowing, we wouldn't have a diversified lending portfolio. So S&P wouldn't give us a AAA rating if we had something like 50 to 60% of our debt lent to Auckland Council. So that means Auckland have to do around two thirds of their borrowing in their own name.  And so that's where that other sort of 20% is going. That's simply Auckland borrowing in their own name. So that's something we really don't have a lot of control over. And the other objective we didn't meet is getting out to meet all of our member councils in the last 12 months.  We are doing Zoom meetings and telephone calls. And as soon as the COVID situation improves, hopefully in the next few months, we'll be back on the road doing face-to-face meetings. In terms of our SOI,  We've reformatted the way we set out our performance targets. So we used to say we have primary objectives, and then we had some secondary objectives. Now we've changed it, so they've been broken down into five different categories of performance targets. So you'll see when you look at the business targets and the optimal,  economising finance targets, they're largely the same, they've just been put into the different categories. Where it has changed is on this page is in the environment and social responsibility area, that we've added a number of new targets in there. And that is really just to reflect that there's a change, both in the reporting standards that  ourselves and councils are going to have to meet, and also some performance targets in the areas of sustainability and climate change that councils probably are going to need to meet. You know, some councils will have greater challenges than others.  And if you look at the last one, industry leadership and engagement, this is something that's been a change in our role probably in the last sort of few years. There's so much change going on in the sector in respect of three waters.  RMA reform, the future of local government, climate change. So whereas we used to just see ourselves as a financer of councils, we now sort of recognise that we need to take a proactive role in helping councils through some of the other reforms and changes that are going on in the sector. So I will stop there and happy to take any questions",

    "text": " Yes, so it is a reasonably new sort of initiative for us. So in part, it reflects that investors are demanding more information about where the proceeds of debt are going to also reflects that, you know, councils and ourselves all  also have some responsibility, I suppose, in respect of things like sustainability and climate change, that's recognising that growing need to sort of be in that sort of space and to help councils. So we've done two green loans in the last six months. I've just got them up on screen. So one was to Greater Wellington Regional Council,  and one was to Wellington cities. So Greater Wellington is a sort of like to do with a transformation of that sort of Hutt River sort of precinct to do with flood protection, things like that. And the Greater Wellington is a five-star sort of green building, the convention sort of centre. So we're not forcing this on councils, but we sort of want to,  where they have green or sustainable projects, or they have climate-linked targets, we can link a line to a target that you have, maybe reducing sort of emissions, that we will give you a discount of five basis points on that line. So there's nothing in it for us, but we just want to incentivize councils when they're ready to participate in this space.  So we're happy to work with you and do most of the work in terms of trying to identify sort of projects. One of the tricky issues is the three waters reform. So a lot of those water assets would have been perfect in terms of, you know, green and sustainable lending, but there's not much point going into that space while, you know, some sort of transition away from councils is likely, but we'll see where that goes in the next year or two.",

So we're happy to help sort of facilitate that in terms of maybe the financing that might sit behind that and maybe the system side of things as well. But it will be a scheme whereby, you know, you do get those rate payers and affordability is again, you know,  It is a challenge and it will probably get worse, more of a challenge. So providing people that are sort of asset rich in terms of their own house.  The ability to defer rates, so LGFA or another financer would sort of mean that the councils get their money up front and investors that might be LGFA sort of just provide their finance until that money is able to be repaid when the house is being, is eventually sort of sold.  So I know you can take out reverse annuity mortgages, but this will simply be a lot cheaper way. So we will do it at, you know, our cost of funds, whereas if you go to Heartland and do it, you're probably paying, you know, six, seven, 8%, whereas we can probably do it at one or 2%, so. Yeah.",

So depends on your age versus your life expectancy, the value of your house, existing lending on that sort of house. I'd suspect the amount of rates that will be deferred would take a long time for it to accumulate  where you've got an excess of the value of the property. But yes, that's where sort of Cameron Partners and things sort of come in, so they will set rules around it to ensure that any lender is sort of protected. So if you had a 90% loan on your house, it's unlikely you'd then be able to do any rates deferment through the scheme.",

    "text": "Thank you, members. Really appreciate the opportunity to come and have a chat to you this afternoon. Look, I'm going to  take the documents as read and keep my comments very brief, really just to highlight a few key things, I guess, with the statement of intent in particular. Look, CoLab's future is really exciting. No doubt about that. But in the short term, we continue to face some challenges. And I guess,  you know, Peter and I reflect on and sympathise with our shareholding councils who are facing a bit of a perfect storm, if you like, with a pandemic and  a pandemic and central government reform coming at you left, right and centre, resource constraints and obviously continued growth within the region. It doesn't make life easy for you and by any stretch and as I say we sympathise with that. I guess the implication for us is  we are increasingly seeing less capacity for Council staff to help support some of the projects that we are looking to deliver on. And so our projects are taking longer than we would  we would ideally like them to. And it's a bit of a balancing act for us, and we continue to walk that line between, I think we've talked about going as hard and fast as we possibly can in the past, but at the same time, obviously being cognizant of the bandwidth that councils have to help support us. And while we've got, as a result of the transformation of the company, a small core team, we are still small and we are  continuing to rely on council resource to help facilitate the development of opportunities in particular. So, yeah, look, that is noted in the document as certainly our key, our single key challenge, I guess.  In that regard, I would like to, and I won't name people, but just acknowledge that we do receive a huge amount of support from my past staff, notwithstanding capacity constraints. I know that they do their absolute damnedest to help us out whenever possible, and we are very grateful to them for that support.  So notwithstanding that, I guess, pretty fundamental challenge, we do have cause for some excitement. So we are progressing to market in the next few weeks with our first initiative in the customer digital enablement program.  which is around sustainability and rubbish and recycling. It's referred to as SR4. So we're pretty excited about that. We also are shortly to issue proposals to councils to participate in CoLab Learning, which is an initiative that  stemmed out of the People and Capability Managers Working Party, so Steph Shaw, in your case, and obviously supported by learning and development specialists within the council. So, as I say, we're going to release proposals on that shortly and hope to have that stood up.  probably in the middle of the year, I suspect there's a timing on that, as will be a, hopefully, a procurement support service. So I know that Waip\u0101 has internal resource, but has indicated that it would be great to have a bit of overflow access, if you like, to additional resources and when required. And certainly there's some smaller councils where  you know, their procurement resource is a bit part of a broader role and they've tasked us with looking at how we might provide a centralised support service. So those are some examples of some pretty cool stuff that I think we have got coming up in the coming 12 months and  will certainly add value to our shareholding councils. We're certainly beyond those priority projects, we obviously want to continue to deliver on our value through our existing suite of services, so water services, sampling and analysis and the like, and  and Rata. We also want to work out how we can continue to communicate with you guys better. And we will shortly, on the back of the draft SOI, be releasing an updated document, you may recall, or may have seen it. In fact, I think you have seen it from my discussion with Ken, a summary of our relationship with your council.  and the value that we believe we've provided to the council and the investment you have made. And we'll be looking to update that, as I say, on the back of this draft SOI in the next few weeks. And we want to get better at communicating with you and reporting that value. So we've got a bit of an internal project going on to look at that over the next few months.  So look, I'm gonna leave it there. I'm very happy to take questions. Thank you once again for the opportunity to talk to you.",

We're right in the transformation of a few things that we're looking at changing for the company going forward. But before I continue, I just want to acknowledge Ian Brown, who was the previous CEO for Civic. I just want to tai toko all the good work that he's done.  for our company and particularly for local government staff.  He's been one of the biggest instigators of this firm in regards to getting people in that right habit of saving for their retirement. And I can actually say that Waip\u0101 is a very good supporter of our two schemes, which are the Super Easy Employer Scheme, as well as the Super Easy KiwiSaver Scheme. So I just wanted to make sure that Ian was recognized for that, because Ian's last day is coming up on Thursday.  He's finishing up with Civic, although, like good people, I've asked him to come back for a couple of days after he's had a sabbatical for a couple of months to do a bit of work for me. Look, my name's Charlie Howe, and I thought it's really important that you probably understand my background. I'm really new to the role, but just to give you some comfort, I spent 40 years in banking. I stayed with the one bank. I was a heritage national banker.  I retired as the general manager for the ANZ looking after the business and retail portfolio. I spent basically my 40 years, like a lot of the councils and council workers, sort of taking my whanau all around the country and running branches and getting to know what community is all about.  Look, I loved every minute of that role, but then I wanted to go and help our people, so I was asked to do a role for the Ministry of Social Development as the Director for M\u0101ori and Pasifika. I put together the M\u0101ori strategy, or helped put together the M\u0101ori strategy,  And again, just a unique opportunity for working for central government, working with some lovely people who I admire so much in regards to working in that social environment. It's challenging at the best of times. And I also was lucky enough to head up the post iwi settlement team. So I got involved with iwi quite substantially from that perspective. So I learnt, I thought after 40 years I'd be pretty good at engagement.  But I learned about engagement just working in that three years with iwi. Significant, significant learnings for me. And I took the opportunity of actually going out for coffee with a certain Mr. Brown and he managed to talk me into  becoming the new CEO of Civic Financial Services. So that's sort of my background and why I'm here, but I thought rather than talk about the Statement of Intent, which I think is quite boring, actually, and we're gonna sort of gear it up to actually mean a lot more than just words and numbers, I'm really keen to come back to you, if I'm allowed to, after this presentation in 12 months' time, and show you a different sort of Statement of Intent I'd like to change the company towards.  there's not enough about people in here, there's not enough about well-being in the Statement of Intent, which I think is really important for local government to understand, is that you've got to look after your staff. And if there's one thing I know about money, is that the sooner people start saving, the better off they're going to be. It doesn't matter who they are, what scheme, I'm not worried about them coming super easy, all I'm worried about is making sure the message goes out to all local staff, and under our scheme, our restricted scheme, all wh\u0101nau as well,  that never is the time to start saving us today. And I think that's a mission that a lot of New Zealanders have forgotten about. So that's sort of the influence I want to bring to civic financial services. And I'm really pleased to actually share our story with you today, because we're right in the middle of transformation. We're changing our board as well.  We've got a lot of new board members coming on board who are basically saying to me, we need to change, we need to get our ship into a different world. Automation needs to be considered, technology needs to be considered.  which I get, but it's still going to take time to turn that knob on to where we'd like to go to. So three things that I've asked for support in from the Board of Directors. Three things is we need to position Civic as a trusted, successful, and future-focused steward of members' KiwiSales. That's a priority for us.  The second focus that I've asked the board to consider is that we need to promote the organisation in a planned, managed, targeted and sustained manner to reinforce the desired positioning of what we want to do as a company. And the third one is protecting and managing the civic brand and position its sustainability, not only in our presence with local government, but also  from a profitability perspective, to be able to sustain what they've done in the past, as well as what we're looking at going forward. My aspirations are that I call it Te Paitata, and that's all about new horizons, which embodies the journey of transformation. That's all about looking at what's in front of us now, appreciate the whakapapa that's been done before us,  but what's looking in front of us as far as the New Horizons is concerned. Now, you guys are probably thinking, what does this all really mean for Waip\u0101? Well, as a shareholder, all I wanted to give you some confidence in is that we're taking the coming to the next level. Whilst we've been producing some really good profit in the past, and we'll continue to do so. And we've also made this very clear statement about reducing our members fees, which we're  is that the 1st of April this year, the fees will come down again from 0.40 to 0.37%. I know that's been a big priority of the company, but also you gotta make sure that the returns are reasonable as well. So the focus has been on keeping fees really low, but also my focus is on probably what I call a,  a better view of having both, having really good returns as well as low fees. Andrew from LGFA spoke about tough times. Well, you can certainly consider what our members are going through today with what's been going on in the market. Yes, it's been challenging, but my message is to  staying there, this is a long-term investment. Data has proven over time that we've had these situations before, i.e. only two years ago, when COVID first hit, a lot of our members decided that they'll shift their funds from high growth to conservative, or even to the extreme where they took their money out and invested it with a bank.  And I think it was very pretty obviously after a couple of months down the line, the market regenerated and went back to normal. A lot of people lost a lot of money. And I think if you have a look back in time, if you have a look at GFC and what SARS did, it was pretty obvious the market goes up and down. And this is a long term investment. So that's sort of been the messaging to our members.  Look, I'm really excited to actually hold the role. I'm looking forward, I've spoken to Gary, I'm looking forward to getting in front of, you know, kanoi, kita kanoi to some of the staff in Waip\u0101, just to tell our story and to support them. But we are looking at different ways of communicating. We're looking at producing  presentations that could be launched into your portals and councils. So staff can determine when they want to look at that and listen to that. With that, I'm really keen on producing presentations that don't have me talking, but have our members telling their story about why they are in these certain schemes. So we're right at the cusp of producing that stuff. So looking forward to that coming out.  Look, I've done enough talking, and I just wanted to say thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I'm looking forward to working really closely with the local government staff on my part. Kia ora. Any questions?",

But for most people, it's a knee-jerk reaction. And unfortunately, as you've alluded to, a lot of people lose money because  their money's out when the market goes back up, and then they're all sort of annoyed that they've lost all this money. So yeah, I think it's a really good message that you really need to reinforce in many different ways so people really understand the risk of pulling the money out, and it is a long-term investment. You're not looking at something over the here and now or over a crisis, for instance. So yeah, I talk about what you're talking about.",

    "text": " Yes, so through the Chair, I'm happy to lead off on this report. Hey, I do notice we do have a team from Rest Haven with us. So, yeah, so John and David and Co, I know you had your camera on before. I might pay to turn that on again.  Yep, welcome. Yeah, so look, Chi, I'll just lead through this item, which is, to be fair, a bit of a difficult item because, yeah, because as I've acknowledged in the covering report, look, Rest Haven is certainly a community-based not-for-profit who has done over many, many years outstanding work in the Cambridge community.  That is absolutely, absolutely acknowledged. But look, what they have come to us with today, and in fact, not today, obviously, over a period of time, they have indicated, look, they would love some council financial support towards a very significant development that they are doing in their complex in Cambridge.  And, you know, that is a very legitimate request. But I guess as I signal in this report, well, both myself and Tony signal in this report, look, this is probably unfortunate timing in terms of the request, because any assistance that Council would provide here  would be very much a grant fund, sorry, grant funding. So this would be operational expenditure. It would come straight out of straight out of ratepayer dollars. And look, just at this moment, you will, councillors, you'll be aware how challenging our annual plan was.  in terms of pulling that together, in terms of sticking within our rates limit, if we were to go ahead with a request note, no matter what the magnitude, this would really have some impact in that regard.  Just noting that the development that Westhaven is doing is of course going to bring in some DCs. Those development contributions are already pretty significantly discounted, as Tony has pointed out.  in the report. So we're acknowledging here that this development is far less a drain on our infrastructure than some other developments, and so we compensate accordingly in line with the DC policy.  But, look, we don't believe that we can give any further relief in the DCs area, and certainly it can't be relief out of the development community, because otherwise other parts of the development community are going to have to pick up that tab. So, like I say, that returns back to a ratepayer funding situation, whether that be relief of DCs or whether that be by means of another grant.  So, yeah, so look, very clear recommendation from the officers, and look, I have had numerous discussions with Westhaven over the last little while. This is not a surprise to them. I was very transparent that the officer  the officer recommendation would be to decline. But look, I've also been very, very conscious that Resthaven do deserve a good hearing. And for that reason, they are in the room today and certainly able to put their case.  I guess the only other thing I would just say is, although you have got a very clear Office of Recommendation that we decline this request, I guess the only other thing that I would just say is, it is your prerogative, elected members,  to look to fulfill this request in some way, I would just say to you that if you are of a mind to do that, I would just point you to the annual plan process in that regard. I certainly don't believe that this is a decision that should be made in isolation.  Like I say, we are under pressure to keep rates within the limit, so if there is some attraction to potentially favourably considering this, like today is the perfect lead in conversation, but I would suggest that you don't make a final decision in that regard, in regard to a favourable regard today, but this perhaps gets considered as part of the annual plan.  considerations. But even in spite of me saying that, as you can see, this is a decline on the part of officers. Just acknowledging that Tony is in the meeting today. Tony obviously has got that DC expertise, so feel free if there's any questions in that regard to ask Tony as well. But Chair, as I said before, we have invited Rest Haven to put their case  So I suggest that probably now is the time to do that.",

Hey, look, I was just going to say that I kind of feel like this organisation, Rest Haven, needs to be treated somewhat differently to any other sort of non-profit groups. And the reason why, and I think many councillors might be aware, but when Rest Haven was first founded in 1960 something, it was Cambridge Borough Council at the time that helped in its, you know, to actually create it as well as the local  grocery groups, lion's groups and things like that. So we are, we're really integral at, you know, obviously this is pre, you know, you know, Waip\u0101 days.  but we are a part of this organisation. And so I just kind of feel a little uncomfortable talking about this group as a separate group, whereas it really was founded by councillors at the time, as well as the other community groups. So I really support Jim's idea around maybe looking at other options. I think that actually sounds really sensible to me. And yeah, we'd really like to explore that further. Thanks, Liz.",

And most rest homes, of course, most rest homes are for profit. So this is unique in itself in our town, and we're very lucky to have it. The other thing is, I think Jim's idea is actually a superb idea. But just to throw another one in the mix, because I would really like to see this get across the line somehow,  As we went to ratepayers with a 4.4% increase, we've settled out so far going into the annual plan consultation with 4.3, which does leave a 0.1% potential buffer in there, just throwing something else on the table. If it was borrowed money, then that 0.1%, you'd only soak up a fraction of it, is what I'm thinking. Just to throw that on the table, maybe Ken can give us some feedback on that, please.",

This is our 50th year in operation here on this site, and it has been a unique relationship between the service groups and council that we are in operation and continuing to be successful. The site and the development was based on the generosity of those service groups and in Lately and council and in Lately  council, along with those service groups, actually help form and appoint the governance board, which I chair, the Westhaven Trust Board. That group of eight individuals all give their time freely. We have an extremely high level of governance running this organisation. We value the community that we serve. We are an integral part of that community. We value the aged  population of Cambridge, which has burgeoned. I'll draw attention to the fact that we are not for profit, but we're not for loss either. So, we run a very fine line. This business is first and foremost community based and looking after the older and aged, ageing population of Cambridge.  With that, I think I should just leave it, apart from the fact that I just want to really emphasise that community spirit that we value between Waip\u0101 and the service communities, groups and rest home.

    "text": "T\u0113n\u0101 koutou katoa, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Chair, Deputy Mayor and Councillors. Hopefully you are now seeing a presentation on your screens.  Really, it's just a few slides just to walk through the intentions and proposal. So our collective challenge. The first point, no surprise to you, you're managing this on a day-to-day basis. The increasing growth within the Waipa area, above average over the rest of New Zealand, and of course, the average age increasing as well.  Nationally, of course, our older population makes up about 15.3% in the census 2018 statistics. In Cambridge, this is 19.4, and it's rising to about just under 1.4, 1 to 4 by about 2028, so about 23.7%. Currently, there are about 931 dwellings in Cambridge for our elderly.  And about 33% of those live in these dwellings. Most of them are in the commercial setting, a few with the council and rest haven in the not-for-profit. So the balance of that group, about two and a half thousand, live in the wider community.  As we know from the studies that you did in 2018, about 55% earn less than $25,000 a year. So they're living basically on their superannuation. By 2028, this will increase to about 1,600 people living out in the community. However, challenge we've got, only 151 dwellings are targeted for the low socioeconomic.  those people living on 25K or less. That's the pension of flats, bail court that you've developed, and the 75 or so villas and care beds here at Rest Haven. And so that's the challenge that we've got in future. And it really supports the 51% increase in single occupancy dwellings that the 2018 accommodation study concluded that we need in the next 15 years to cope with the growth.  So basically, the new rest haven development that have been spoken about will help address the shortfall. We're building 77 new apartments, and this will supplement the existing 83 villas, four apartments that exist at the moment, and 112 care beds. So a sizable not-for-profit operation. So what we're proposing is that during stage one of the development, which is going to occur in the next three years,  is that we convert three offices and five office shells into five studio units and three apartments just up on the top floor here. As part of the sub project of the whole project, we're looking at offering five studio units at further below market rentals for Cambridge elderly, so they can survive in them on the national superannuation income. More rental options will be available for stages two and three,  but the majority of these apartments will be from occupational rider brands, and these will help fund the rental options. What we're also looking at doing is the philosophy's changed, and that more care is delivered into these apartments and studios, so that our residents, it becomes their home, and therefore more and more support is delivered to them as they become less and less mobile or more affirmed.  So what we're looking at doing is converting current structure of five studios and three studio apartments at about $900,000 plus GST. And of course, we're asking you to see if you could help cost or fit out one of those studio units for $81,000 plus GST. Here's the current photograph showing  the current system and we're looking at fitting out one of these studios here with its own bed, toilet facilities, et cetera. So why assist us? Well, it's been mentioned, I don't need to harp on about the not-for-profit arrangement or the 50 years that basically the fundraising started in 66 and the first resident arrived about 72. So 50 years of support to the community.  You will be aware that Resthaven Trust Board recently purchased Rayburn and renamed it Resthaven-on-Burns. And that was to provide further affordable care. So another 54 Cambridge elderly could live in there with good care, but at affordable rates. Resthaven Trust Board also purchased To and Fro Transport Service and have been providing affordable companion transport services for elderly living in the wider community.  taking people into Hamilton and around Waikato, particularly around Cambridge. So what we're doing, what we're proposing, of course, is to increase the potential for our elderly. And as has been mentioned by His Worship the Mayor, it's a fairly good return on your investment. Five additional flats or studios for the elderly rentals at a cost of about $81,000 each.  Of course, that $81,000 is a realistic request. I mean, you might be so generous as to fund all five and give us $400,000, and that would be even more appreciated. But I think we've been very realistic in terms of, we understand your predicament in terms of rate rises, and we're trying to be realistic in our expectations and requests.  So what we're asking really is the funding of the fit-out, we call it the Y-pass studio at the cost of 81,000 plus GST, and that it will enable the Rest Haven Trust Board to redirect funds to other communities for the elderly.

As you'd be aware, this is a major build, an extremely major build, and the total cost of stage one is $36 million, of which we have borrowed to do so.  Okay, so we have taken on risk as a community trust board to do that. It's a calculated risk. It's not frivolous by any means. It's been a long process to get us to this point. The Livingston Builders local firm is on site doing the build as we speak. They've just started this week. So as you can see, a community trust with good governance because we've changed our ORA model  what was 60-40 split, we're now 50-50 split with regard to capital sharing. So once the unit is sold, the capital gain is shared 50-50. That is unlike most other, well, it is unlike the other operators in the local area where it is  capital gain is not shared. So we've taken steps as governors to shore up our finances going forward, as well as converting and becoming more relevant in the local aged care provider market in Cambridge, like John mentioned, bringing care to your home. So you move into Rest Haven,  you won't go into care, care will come to you. So it's a different sort of model that we are doing here as well. I'll hand over to Don or David.

And then hopefully we'll go on to any questions and see where we get to. So I guess one of the key things with this report is that it has been through the Cambridge Community Board and has been endorsed by them for the criteria that we've formatted and the process moving forward with lighting of the Cambridge Town Hall and the Clock Tower.  Previous to this, this has been a project managed by the properties team, but they've had a little shuffle up with their team over the recent months and they've noticed an increase in requests that we didn't really have a set criteria to review against.  And so this conversation got started. So yeah, we've done a bit of research around a few different places around the country that like different buildings and things like that, and formulated a criteria that we think best represents the type of requests that we've been seeing over the last few years. And moving forward, we are hopefully going to be having an online form available on our website. So members of the community have access  to request lighting of these assets for a certain project or community engagement initiative and once those requests are received the communication and engagement team will receive those and work in with two key partners to this whole process so the property team for the actual physical works  and then also the Cambridge, hopefully I get this right, Cambridge Town Hall Community Trust representative as well moving forward because we know that we need to make sure all conversations are really clear in that space moving forward with different uses of the town hall as those increase over time and ensuring we're not having any crossovers with  different activations within that one space. Yeah, so we've had some great discussions with Kirstie from the Town Hall Trust. So yeah, looking forward to working with them moving forward and the property team as they find their feet moving forward as well. So yeah, any questions, queries? Go for gold.",

We would expect and hope that things could be tracked a lot quicker, but depending on what our workloads are between the communication and engagement team, the property team at the time, which are currently under resource while they work through some things, and the external party to council, it's just the six weeks is giving us a buffer to work through different teams. If we were in a busy period when we got a request, we can certainly,  shrink that down to maybe four weeks.

In regard to the recent Ukraine one that I was quite involved with, in fact the current Ukraine one I should say, the only hold up there was they just didn't have yellow bulbs available, they had the blue ones, but they didn't have the yellow bulbs and filters. So there was around about a two or three business day wait.  for those yellow bulbs and filters to come. As soon as they came, they actually went out and actually installed it the following day.

The team were very creative and went out and found some, oh, not glad wrap. Yeah, cellophane. Purple cellophane to put over the up lights and lit the side of the library up purple, which made me wonder,  Is this relating solely to the Cambridge Town Hall and Clocktower, or would this extend to other council-owned assets like the Te Umuti Library?",

So this report is currently just for the two assets in Cambridge because that's where we've been or the property team has been receiving the public inquiries the most or yeah, completely.

It's something as a council, I think we need to consider. Just haven't tucked in the back of our minds for a couple of years time. And I think the community board do too, because the technology is there now, obviously, through LEDs and through Wi-Fi, just to flick a switch from wherever in the world to light this thing up in whatever colour or colours we wish.  Yeah, I'd like, I really like to, I know it's separate to this, but it is part of a whole probably lead in time and why there needs to be so much lead in time, et cetera.

So we've had some slight improvements in the roads and footpaths area and also in the water treatment and supply group of activities as well. So COVID restrictions, they continue to impact the level of service results, particularly those surrounding the visitation of council heritage facilities with six out of seven of the heritage measures currently off track or at risk of not meeting the end of year target.  All exceptions are outlined under each group of activities, so you can read more there. We also have the progress against council strategic priorities outlined in the report as well. Those are on page four, sorry, 246. There's a few which are currently off track, generally due to timing issues at the moment.  You'll see on page 236 of the agenda, there's also a non-financial performance overview on there. And that has a few key highlights for the past four months as well. But happy to take any questions in that space as well.",

And I've chosen that community services and facilities page, because the last sentence is, in summary, there are a total of 33 performance measures for the group, of which 11 are considered on track, which means you could assume that 22 are off track. But in fact, most of them are annual measures. So I disagree with saying that  that all the ones that we haven't reported on or are on track must be off track. I think it would be better to state that something like, well, I don't know if you could say that anything that is an annual report is considered to be on track. Yeah, it's just that people just picking up that statistic, that number, would say, oh, council's hopeless because  They've got so many off track and the councillors don't seem to be worrying about it.",

I think the whole team at Wiper District, this report and the number of variations where you've got plus and minus just shows how difficult it is to build a budget that's going to move forward.  into a period when we've got so many challenges and variations as to what we can do and what we can't do and what is available what isn't available it's like having a crystal ball and the crystal ball is just so hazy so i really do appreciate the challenge that you've got and uh  as was said, in many cases, it's plus and minus some instances, it's a deferred timing. And then of course, you get all the challenges of supply chain, which is going to be around, I think, for quite a few months to come. I do have a question, and it's very much of Ken, and seeing the variation in the surplus, does that have any impact on our future planning for say, next year?",

I assume that's what you're referring to?  This is on page 228 of the agenda. So, look, yeah, I guess you do need to be very mindful in terms of, you know, there are a number of non-cash items in there. There are also, and in fact, very relevant to the discussion, so things like development contributions, which of course are cash,  But, yeah, I can see that $8 billion of that decrease relates, or of that re-forecast, relates to development contributions. And, of course, that is ring-fence money. And, of course, what we have done is slowed down the capital expenditure as well to compensate. Yeah, you know, we know that development has been delayed.  we have delayed the CapEx that those DCs are funding. So, yeah, so look, fundamentally, in regard to your question, no, look, it's not causing us undue concern in regard to the implications for the annual plan. Yeah, I think, you know, in terms of some of the key cash flow numbers, you know, those are very much rates-funded cash flow numbers. Those are very much,  or certainly broadly in line with expectations, is that some of those are more ring-fenced monies that are potentially an issue. And like I say, we've got ability to mitigate in those areas. Greg Morgan Thank you.",
