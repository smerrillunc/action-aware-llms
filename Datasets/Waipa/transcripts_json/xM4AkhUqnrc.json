I see we've got media in the room and obviously we're streaming online. Just reminders that that is the case.  So let's kick off with our agenda then, shall we? First matter of the day is our usual apologies. I understand we have apologies from Mayor Jim and we have Councillors Barnes and Gordon zooming in and obviously Kirsty Downey as well.

Late items, I'm not aware of there being any.  Nope, there are none, and therefore we need somebody to confirm the order of our meeting for us. Andrew's happy to move that. Mike's gonna second that. All those in favour say aye. Aye. Against. Carried. Moving on then to the confirmation of the minutes of our meeting in June. These appear on page eight of our agenda. So I'll just flick through the pages and give me a holler if there's anything you wish to address. Pages eight and nine, 10 and 11,  And 12. minutes there.  We're fine, and everybody's quite, you're happy with that, Lou? Thank you very much, Lee. Obviously, can't be Clare or Hazel, so, and Bruce will second that. All those in favour, say aye. Aye.

    "text": " Kia ora katoa. As discussed and requested at your last meeting, today's report provides an outline for a public funding round from the Waipa District Council Community Recovery Fund, along with revised criteria and a draft application form. This funding round has been developed to allow decision making and allocation of funding at the September 2022 committee meeting. So this is trying to get this in before the end of this training.  The criteria has been based on feedback that you have provided over the last 10 months with what I think we've previously talked about as being an ever-changing COVID-19 environment. It is proposed all of the criteria is to be met within the applications and some key points of the criteria has been a local WIPA activity or project promoting response to or recovery from the impacts of COVID-19.  We've also included businesses and not just community groups based on our discussions. Evidence of connection of the activity project to the full well-beings. So this is once again to align with opening up to business opportunities and we will add an explanation around the full well-beings within the information to help applicants.  Applications cannot be retrospective and must not have received funding for the similar activity or project from council. So the draft application form included in Appendix 2 is an updated version of the first form we used, and this is being updated to connect with the criteria that's been set to show those connections through the application.  The amount for this funding round I'm proposing has been at $80,000. So this is based on discussions had at the last meeting and allows for another funding opportunity in the new year as we're aware COVID-19 continues to be within our community and we have got new variants coming into the country as well. So obviously still dealing with COVID.  As part of the costs, I'm also suggesting some funding of up to 5,000 to help support advertising of this funding round to get that awareness out there as well as developing some collateral as required. So based on your discussions today, really happy to receive any feedback and we can update this to enable it to go out to the community in a week or so to allow us to do that update there. So really open to any questions.  Thanks Sally.",

I wasn't involved in the workshop that discussed this previously, but I feel it is really important that the purpose of the first criteria, it seems to cover initiatives that would be directed at, you know, COVID-19 sort of  responses, but I was also wanting to see where an organisation is suffering effects themselves, you know, with their sustainability, I guess. And that doesn't seem to be covered under that first point. And the second thing I'd like to query is the use of this fund to support advertising of it.  because I don't wanna see the quantum reduced for something which I feel is business as usual for council and that surely there's an existing budget that could be drawn on.

Were you thinking, Councillor Clare, around it being operational cost? Is that where your operational view from that perspective? So maybe we add that into that as well.

Any groups that are in the situation that you've outlined, I think, Roger, will have ongoing operational costs, or they'll certainly have a, I think, something that they can come to the council for to help, you know, fit this criteria. So if there's a group that is right on the cusp, as you suggested, you know, we could certainly, I think we should certainly look at it, but retrospective funding can be, I think it's dangerous, and I'd be really concerned if we sort of went down that route.  The other point I was just going to make, sorry Sally, is that in terms of the ability to get this fund recognised and certainly promoted out there in our communities, we have existing organisations that can do that for us. The local iSites, the Citizens Advice Bureaus, there's lots of organisations that have databases that can get to all of these clubs and organisations anyway, so  I'd like to think that we can do that without having to kind of take money from the fund, you know, as Claire was saying.

We've missed out on $30,000 worth of grants and we can forecast  you know, that deficit. And so it's in the current financial year. So it's not like they've sort of incurred, like they've bought something and then, oh, we don't have the money to pay for it. But it's, I don't know, how do people feel about that? I think Andrew's probably got some good ideas. Yeah.

It can lead to a situation where somebody hives off with what they perceive as a good idea. They get into a little bit of strife. Oh, we'll go back to the board and pick that up. No, you must be up front before you start so the board's got a complete picture of what's going on and to allow those funds to be allocated.

If you go back into retrospective, you actually open up a very, very large area, which is very difficult to actually administer. I would say one thing that as involved with a little bit of funding and actually a lot of volunteer groups, there is huge deficits out there at the moment, right across the spectrum.  And we're seeing normal sponsorship and community donations drawing up right across the spectrum. At junior sport, particularly, this is starting to impact. So we will see a large amount of applications, I think, from these sort of organisations. And just remember that this fund is limited and it's time limited as well as limited in size.

And I mean, there could be a really strong and application with great merit that only covers one. And by virtue of the criteria, it's no longer eligible. And I sort of, my sense is that's getting narrowing down the eligibility so much so that a lot of really meritorious applicants would be knocked out.

Within number six, we're talking about all current bank account statements and or  financial position statement so inclusion of that in there and we're remaining with the number eight including it cannot be retrospective but in terms of operational definite  deficit looking at that for this current year or a projection forward for that. And if I can go to the recommendations. So from what I've heard in terms of B, we will be reducing the recovery fund budget to a value of $80,000. So removing that $5,000 for the advertising, et cetera, to come from internally.  So I think that would be the change to the recommendation I would suggest through discussions.",

And I do think I go along with Mo over there or Councillor Pettit with the fact that we need that. It gives us a broader picture. Just remembering that this fund is, as I said originally, quite limited and quite time constrained. So we can't go digging into details. I just wanted to add one thing while I'm speaking. We might get flooded with applications.  And this is quite a possibility. And would we actually like to record those? Because we are facing, I think, quite a large crisis here. And we saw this with our last discretionary fund through the community board. We had far more applicants than we had funds by a large degree. And I was just wondering whether we actually utilize this as stating that we might have to get some funding from central government or some way to actually recover this or actually help with this.  but we need the figures first to be able to go out and do it.

We go out next week to do our pre-notification consultation with iwi and other statutory bodies. We're looking forward to feedback.  we almost have all of our infrastructure review reports in. We are drafting madly. So I've had extra resource from the consents team. I've been utilizing the project planner, which has been awesome. So we're on track to start notification of the plan change on the week starting the 15th.  of August, so it has to be notified on the 20th of August, which is a Saturday. We'll be notifying in the Waikato Times jointly with Waikato District on the 19th, and it will go up on our website. Earlier that week, we will go into the two Cambridge newspapers and the Te Aumutu newspaper, and we will start doing letter drops to ratepayers that week as well.  There will be a council workshop on recommendations that have come out of the technical reports that we've had done. And I will be bringing to the next ESPNP committee the plan change as a whole for comment and for approval to notify. So we're feeling on track, just feels like it's been a very tight schedule.  and long process. Other plan changes are progressing. You will have Nita from Beka after me talking about plan change 17, how to structure plans and plan change 19, Carter Flat, Commercial Zone, Papak\u0101inga is progressing nicely. Stage one has been contracted out to Future Consultancy Group and he's currently scoping it up for us.  We have had a number of private plan change inquiries, but at this stage they are just inquiries. And the only other aspect, because it's the next item on the agenda, is draft plan change 21. We are looking  to defer the notification of that until early next year to align with Hamilton City, who will be notifying early next year as well, but also to give a little bit of breathing space between plan change 26 being notified and then we can start on PC 21. And the last update is we get a graduate policy planner starting on Monday. Very exciting.",

    "text": " I'm trying to keep all the plan changes straight in my head. So this report builds on the brief discussion I had in the work programme update. I took a change request to the staff growth programme steering group to request that we defer the notification of plan change 21 until early next year.  Part of the reasoning for that was the time commitment required for the residential zone intensification plan change. That's been all consuming for a number of months. And the second reason was Hamilton City had deferred the notification of those. And we just feel because we are doing  those two plan changes would be good to go out at the same time and try and achieve consistency across the two councils. The other intent of this report is just to update you on the technical reports that we've had commissioned both for plan change 26, the housing intensification and plan change 21. So we have  received our character and heritage review back, and that recommends the retention of character clusters, addition of some heritage sites, houses into the heritage register, introduction of character streets,  Rather than having a blanket just a special character area like we currently have so getting quite specific of where the character areas clusters are and that's a requirement of the legislation that we have to do site by site analysis.  We've also had an excellent report back on green infrastructure and open spaces. And that will enable us to put some qualifying measures down to protect open spaces, parks and reserves and our green infrastructure throughout Cambridge, Kihiki and Te Ara Mutu.  We've had stormwater and transportation back, and I'm about to dive into those today to see what their recommendations are. And I think we're waiting on water, the water review to come back, and then Becca is doing a summary report of all our infrastructure reports, just so we've got the main points in one document. So further details on our technical reports will be provided at the council meeting later on.  this month and what I'm aiming to do is just under each section just have the main recommendations and also to indicate yes we've carried those through into PC26, no we haven't and this is why we haven't. Some recommendations are out of scope, some are awesome and they are going to help us moving forward to keep our amenity and our character in the Waip\u0101 district.",

So that would allow us to itemise out probably new areas and overlays for different street corridors and allow for that parking to be on the roads there.

But for the benefit of time, I'd just like to, if I can just pick out four, four questions. I realize, first of all, that it's a high level document, and I accept that. But  In these questions, I am really specifically addressing Cambridge. My apologies to Tiawamutu and other councillors, but I've done it in regard to that consideration. So the first question is that in page 19, the principles  of the document state that the intention is to implement the strategy through the RPS and the district plan. And then if you flick on to page 96, it clearly identifies that the Cambridge and TA target densities for defined intensification areas and greenfield developments. And they're quite considerably  higher than what we currently have in our district plan. And then on page 112, matters for inclusion  in the Waikato RPS change, it states that they will be. So there's no doubt that those intensification target densities are going to be included in the regional policy statement.  Now, my challenge and my question of David is once they're included in the regional policy statement, in terms of the hierarchy, that means that that is above our district plan so that when we have a plan change, it's like this national policy statement of higher densities, we can't actually object against it.  If they're in the RPS, then our local opportunity to vary that is removed. So we must agree to those higher levels of density. Now, I'm taking it that that will apply  to those areas in our growth cells that are currently not covered by development agreement or under construction now. So it'll be all of those newer outlying areas. Am I correct in that assumption?",

I think just going back to where you started, just to note, future proof itself, the strategy document is non-statutory. So it's not a document that has enforcement weight.  itself. But as you mentioned, the idea is that key elements such as the density targets get incorporated into an update to the regional policy statement, which as you correctly state,  is a statutory document that we have to give effect to. So yes, in the course of time, it does manifest in something we do have to give effect to. But as I started by saying,  The whole thing's been overtaken by government legislation introduced at the end of last year. So the amendment to the RMA that broadened the medium density residential standards actually supersedes this. And one of Joe Cook-Monroe's plan changes, plan change 26,  is about enabling greater housing density, and that's to give effect to the legislation. So in terms of the tier, national legislation will trump the RPS. So in fact, anything we're doing now, we have to kind of wait and see what  comes out from the plan change process that is giving effect to the amendment to the RMA. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, it does make sense.",

We in our submission to the Parliamentary Select Committee at the end of last year, these were some of the concerns that we, along with a number of other submitters, did raise is that there is concern that what you get is a doughnut where  your growth cells, your greenfield areas are easier to apply the greater density than your existing residential areas. So that is one of the concerns. And we've got to go through our plan change process. One of the things Joe mentioned, what we're looking at is what are our qualifying matters that we can take into account to mitigate a kind of blanket application of those medium density standards.  So coming back to your point about the density target, sir, it's a long term aspirational goal, and it's there to support public transport, more effective public transport. But we all know in the real world,  built environment doesn't change quickly. You can't just transform the landscape in an existing town into something else.

Now, we know that that's not the rapid transit because the rapid transit is more for those high urban areas. This is the frequent link that joins Hamilton to Cambridge. Now, that schematic very clearly shows the link going from Cambridge to Hautapu  to Ruakura. Now then, we had a presentation just two weeks ago from Waikato Regional Council public transport plan that actually showed that the frequent transport services go from Cambridge through Tamahiri to Hamilton. Now, we've got two regional documents there, both which are telling us different stories. I can see  why they're taking it through Howtapu, because within the future proof, Howtapu will be close to being the second largest industrial area in the future proof region. It's going to be massive. And that's obviously why the plan says it's going to go through there. So which one do we have to go to?",

Having looked at page 56, it's not indicating whether that's rail or road, it just says public transport. I agree in terms of the way the schematic shows it's routed through Hatapu and it goes on into Rokura.  I'm not sure whether that's, you know, an attempt to pick up the existing railway line. I'm not sure. But what I can say is the work on the  transport business program the work that was presented to you more recently is more recent work than what went into future proof and and I would say you you would want to trust that work and regard this as what Kirsty was saying at the outset it's a high level strategic document and some of these schematics will go out of date on and probably are out of date already.",

I'm sorry, I just can't accept the fact that you  You just sit back and say, it's a high level, therefore we shouldn't worry about them. Anyway, let's move on from there rather than have an argument over the council table. My next question is page 36, compact and concentrated. And it talks about the needs or the idea of a 30 minute city, 30 minute community,  of walk, cycle and public transport. Now I totally agree with that concept, great concept. The challenge is with Cambridge, we've now grown to the size  where we're now starting to get considerable communities that are outside of that circle from the inner town centre and services. Now there's nothing in future proof that actually looks at the need to address that 30 minute community in the provision of  public transport systems into a town the size of Cambridge?",

It talks about through a more compact urban form we are aiming to work towards a sub-region of 30-minute communities.  So I think it's a valid one to make. It's one we are wanting to promote in terms of our own transport planning. We're working on both the micro mobility and the public transport. So it's looking at, I think, multimodal solutions, but with that goal in mind that you can live, work, play within a reasonable distance.",

    "text": "One more, Roger? Yeah, my fourth and last one is just a question of the fact that the growth that's indicated, and they acknowledge that on meeting demand and projecting the growth of YPAR,  26,000 in that future proof window of 30 years. And 88% will be in the urban areas of Cambridge and TA, which is accepted. And that's quite a high level of growth. But if you look at how that growth is going to be spread, it's about 70% in Cambridge and 30% in TA. And that's really on the indications  on our pre 35 growth cells. Now then, if you look at the subnational population estimates as at the 30th of June, 2021, Cambridge is 21,400 population, TA 13,350 population. And if you spread that growth that future proof talks about,  That says that Cambridge will grow to 37,000, TA to 20,000. Now, Cambridge is undoubtedly now the largest residential area outside of the metropolitan centre of Hamilton in the future proof area. And it's going to become even more so  Now, that's not seen within that future proof document as an area of substantial size, which is going to require  an increased allocation of resources into it in terms of the development of the communities and the town. I just think that there needs to be, they say that in the hierarchy of settlement pattern in the future proof area, it kind of lumps Cambridge with the small towns in the Waikato.  I think Cambridge, you know, is there not the opportunity for a separate section recognising the size of Cambridge?",

I think it's kind of obvious at this stage that yes, Cambridge is the largest town outside of Hamilton in the subregion.  But there's significant growth kind of being anticipated in various places around the subregion. And I think the role of Cambridge is more a matter for us as WIPA in our planning to deal with than it is necessarily for us to be pointing figures at future proof. But that's my viewpoint, Roger.",

I'm really concerned about that, that in the blurb about approving this future-proof strategy, you know, they said that it had been worked on collaboratively and that, and they were hoping that we would  you know, give our agreement to it. But in fact, the issues I'm raising, I raised them, you know, six months ago when it was being worked on and it doesn't seem to have got through. So my issue is that Pirongia Village is designated as an urban area. Again, I looked up what the definition of an urban area is. You know, it usually has reticulated services, yeah, public transport,  apartments and commercial areas. So I'd say it's a stretch to say Pirongia is that, and yet we have on page 96 of the report or page 146 of our agenda, that Pirongia is going to have a density of development of 20 to 35 houses per hectare.  No riders on that. Now, you kindly pointed out that on another part of the document, on page 63, there's a little footnote. So that's on page 113 of our agenda. It says, Pirongi is not really expected to develop at this level because it doesn't have reticulated services like, you know, sewerage.  yeah but for it to still be in that table on page 96 to say this is the anticipated density of greenfield development I just what I really think it should be in the rural villages yeah and also we had a great award-winning  concept plan done for Pirongia Village, where the residents said we want to stay, calling ourselves a village. And yet here we have, in this high-level document, which we know is going to lead a lot of decision-making for the next 20 to 30 years, that that group of people, and Waip\u0101 Council is one of them, sees Pirongia as an urban area. Yeah, I'm really concerned about that.",

And it's certainly picked up in the footnote that currently there are no services and there are no plans by WIPO to provide services, so it remains a village.  I did point out Stats NZ not helpfully do identify it as an urban area, and that's simply because of its population size. So they pick it up and Future Proof used that as the resource. And the other thing, just to note with this table that you're pointing to on page 96, what it does say in green fuel locations, and we know that  there are no greenfield locations in Porongia, and there's no plans to do it. And that is one of the considerations is that the moment we, if we ever did consider greenfield development, the fingers would point you need to reticulate.

No question, three councils who are all undergoing growth, but also undergoing a great period of change individually in a time where there's so many uncertains as well. I guess the good news when reading this document is that there will be another review prior to 2024. And I think that's reflective and very timely  because we, you know, sitting around this table, what does the next two years actually look like? So I guess, you know, addressing all of the concerns that we have and what change may or may not happen. I mean, growth is just such a fickle thing right now. You know, immigration is at play here and obviously COVID hopefully has gone away, but who knows?  So I guess, you know, having another review prior to 2024, I think will alleviate a lot of the concerns around this table. And everyone is going to continue to watch localism, watch this, you know, all of the different environmental impacts and patterns that we'll start to see.
