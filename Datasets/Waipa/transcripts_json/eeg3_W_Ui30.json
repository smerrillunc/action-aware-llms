    "text": "Yeah, I take the report as read. It's pretty straightforward. There's a couple of items I just wanted to raise and give you a heads up about. One of them is in relation to the Cambridge  Town Hall, I don't know that all are aware or not, but a couple of weeks ago when we had that heavy downpour, I think we had about 90 or a hundred mils in average Sunday night a couple of weeks ago, the ceiling in the Edwardian room partially collapsed. So probably about a quarter of it has come down and that is a result of water damage.  So we've been up on the roof of that area. The roof is pretty well past its use by date. It's been painted previously, but when they repaired it, they've just siliconed up holes and things like that, and that silicon's worn out. The roof is rusting. The flashings are shot, so  We've started work this morning on replacing that portion of the roof. So that's on the Lake Street side near the bus stop. So all of that roof on the parapet and the flat bit there is being replaced at the moment. So they've started work today. We're not too sure what we may or may not uncover. There could be damage to timber and a few other things, but we don't know until we get the roof off.  The weather is predicted to be fine this week. So hopefully we'll get a good run at it and get that portion replaced. But looking at the state of the roof there, if the rest of the roof is anything like that, I'd suggest that we may be up for a complete roof replacement going forward in the not too distant future. We've also had Chemwash up there last Friday. So they took basically  ranger, the boot of a ranger or the back of the ranger, they completely filled that up with leaves and that would come out of the gutters. So that's all being cleaned out again. But with those trees there, we probably need to look at doing that on a more regular basis through autumn, probably monthly, I would suggest rather than six monthly because it's just flying back into the building.  So that's where we're at with that. So hopefully that work to replace the roof will be completed late this week or early next week. The other one is the Vale Court complex and looking at building those 10 units on that site. We've now got the land use consent approved for that. So we'll be moving forward with regards to getting designs done, drawings teed up and  and that out to tender as soon as we can. And the other one is that with regards to the guest light theater, they've been talking about the car park there for a number of months, I suppose, that work has started this morning. So that's underway to regrade that. And that should be finished by Friday night. So that's pretty much all I've got with regards to ENSA.  So I'm happy to take any other questions you have.",

We've got 12 and a half years to bring it up to code. So what I was intending doing was to look at what we could do. It's really where it become from the stage back where it becomes two levels because of the sloping site, the back of the property is two levels high.  So the intent was to see if we can, even if you could potentially frame that up and cut that back into the property off, I don't know, but that's something we'll be doing moving forward is to looking at how we can make that structurally sound. But to me, to try and think about removing it and building public toilets somewhere else, you know, I don't know why they cost so much, but they seem to-",

We were lucky to, we managed to,  obtained the same guttering profile and downpipe profile from, we sourced that from Christchurch.

We have cleaned, well, looking at the amount of debris in the gutter, I'm not too sure that we've actually taken everything out of there when we've cleaned them. You know, we filled a ranger up, the back end of a ranger up with mud and stuff that came out of those gutters.  I'd suggest that probably on a monthly basis will suffice. But in saying that, because of the amount of weight that's been in the gutters, the roof is higher than the gutter. So the roofs, you know, when it comes down the roof, it just pours straight off the edge rather than into the gutter. The other issue that we've had is that there's some, there was a down pipe missing. There's no diffusers on it. So when the rain comes off the top roof,  It goes into three or four downpipes and goes into that secondary roof. There's no diffusers on those downpipes. So it simply comes down at a torrent. The downpipes are right on a join. So they were nailed rather than tech screwed. So those nails have lifted. There's dead pigeons, all sorts of things under there.  and the roof has been put on and it's only been left one corrugation rather than a couple of corrugations. So all the water is pouring down on a joint and that's part of the problem. So there's a whole bunch of issues that we need to address there from looking at it. Yeah, and as I say, we need to put a regime in place where during autumn, we need to clean those gutters out on a regular basis.",

The only comment I'm going to make is, and John, I'm sure you're totally on top of this, and, you know, the maintenance repairs that are required need to be done properly. But I'm sure you and Phil can get together to discuss the TIN tax of it. So, thanks for that.  I welcome Phil Lyons. Sorry, we got a little bit confusing there with the Phils, but just one thing I wanted to bring up, John, you note in the report that the expenditure's down by 600,000, mainly due to things not happening over the COVID lockdown. Do I assume correctly that that will be, you know, those works will be done, but coming into the next financial year?",
