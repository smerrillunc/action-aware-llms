It's about general terms of the  what's been happening, especially on this section of road from St Peter's to St Andrew's Church. Yes, give you an idea of my background. Number one, I sat where you guys are sitting now 30 years ago, and I'm well aware  And it is even when I was in business, in construction on some major projects, you get told what your staff want you to know, not necessarily what you should know. And my view of what's been happening, like with design,  Like you take the St. Peter's roundabout, the reason for that to be changed was to relieve congestion. Now, since it's been built, there's never been a major function at the Avanti Drome or St. Peter's because of COVID. But when there, I predict when there will be,  traffic that wants to go straight through that roundabout that should have been made easy or less delays will not happen because traffic coming from Hamilton direction going into the Avanti Drome or St Peter's will hold up traffic from behind and traffic coming to. That roundabout to me should have been built with  two lanes going in on both directions, one going through so the following traffic can just carry straight through. Now my concern is when it is realised that something like that has to be done, there has to be another lot of major roadworks which  Again, with my background in construction, reestablishment doubles the cost. To my view, that should have been done in the first place. My whole emphasis about what has been happening with our roading is, and that's to me been reinforced with the fact that our roading department  And I'm not going on about any specific staff member or anything like that. It's the whole department. Do we have the expertise in it? I don't think we do, because number one, with the cycle track, they had to call in consultants about cycleways and consultants.  me is an admission that we don't have the expertise that we should have. But the consultants came up with putting in raised mounds on the road. Over the years we spent, what experience has given us, the fact that we  for roading, it's flat. That's why we got rid of all the potholes. So what's the point in putting the speed humps in? The one at Vogel Street is highly dangerous. They've had about three attempts now to trying to shave out the danger of it. And mainly that's because the crossover for the cycleway has been put too close to the end of the intersection.  Now, if you hit that hump that they've got there, even though it's been minimized again, with a motorbike on a cold, wet, frosty morning, you're gonna land up going into the, you're gonna lose your front wheel.",

So I'm taking a turn this time around and Tony's going to attend the Te Amaru Community Board.  I think page 15 in your agenda, I'm not going to go into it in too much detail because there is a lot of detail there. Just a little bit of background in case you haven't had it before. So this is the report for Wayne's group, district growth planning and regulatory.  Three teams making up that. Emergency management, you're going to hear from Dave Symes next up. And then Tony Quickfall managing the plan and district growth and myself managing the compliance and regulatory space. And the report pretty much follows that format. So the first  First part of that is what's happening in the planning and growth space, working its way down from what's happening at a national level with the legislation and other reviews that are happening there. And that in itself is a huge amount of business. And then tracks down through what's happening at a regional and then down to district level.  From page three of the reports, the updates on the various concept plans, gross sales, et cetera, and down to the changes proposed for the district plan and some of the district plan rules. And from page six, an outline of some of the more significant consents that Tony's team have been dealing with in the quarter and the numbers around how many of those consents have been issued and granted.  Into page 11 or thereabouts, moving more into my space. So the monthly comparison there on the building consent numbers and the value of those consents in this quarter and the activities of the various other regulatory teams, enforcement, animal control and environmental health summarised towards the end of the report.  So as you'd expect, some very busy teams within this group. Building consents and resource consents tend to be continuing at quite a high level despite lockdowns and other restrictions. So yeah, quite a lot going on in that space. And at the end of the report, you've got quite a lot of detailed appendices there on all those different matters. So that's the quick summary. I'm happy to take any questions. Yeah, won't be able to answer all of them because obviously some of them aren't my teams, but if I can't,  definitely get some answers.",

    "text": " Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair. Good evening, everyone. Yes, I'm happy to take questions. Unfortunately, I think from the last report, we're still dealing with COVID and those matters. And I guess most people are probably appraised of where we're at, certainly through Waipapa and I guess the numbers that we've had, some through Cambridge, but certainly more through Te Aumutu-Kihiki.  So a lot of our work has been in support of the DHB around logistical support with the testing stations, the CBAC, and obviously also the vaccination centres in different places and that council has provided some of those venues or access to those venues and support event centre library for those DHB staff and also the  previous Bunnings building for vaccination in Te Aumutu. And I guess our, you know, around those vaccination numbers for our area, they're quite high. So, yeah, so a lot of work around that. And that's ongoing. Probably the next step for local government and for Civil Defence Emergency Management  will be around the National Protection Plan. So part of that is the traffic light system, which we've seen, but there's more to come on that by the end of November. And we've already been asked to start providing feedback in terms of what that looks like, you know, through 2022, perhaps onwards. A lot of it may centre around self-isolation of people  the pickup COVID and how is that managed through welfare agencies, through our local wealthy committees, MSD, but also how those people interact with government agencies and also  I guess our local government agencies, you know, for the various things, you know, ongoing that people have contact with us over. So there's work to do around that coming up over the next couple of weeks and that'll be the next thing on the horizon for us.  The other things were within the report, so obviously consistent with probably other organisations, some of the things that we'd planned. We had a reasonably large regional resilience forum planned for Kaupiro, the Don Rowland Centre, that's been postponed, hopefully pick that up again in 2022.  Our training, face-to-face training, a lot of it or exercises we do. Obviously some of that we haven't been able to hold, but we're part of workshops to create online capability around that. So that's quite a good thing. And the other thing I'd highlight within the report is working at a regional sort of aligning with a national level around a alerting program. It's called Whisper in terms of  alerting predetermined messages in a timely way when an emergency or disaster occurs, how do we get those messages out to the public quickly? And also, you know, obviously 24-7, a lot of our councils and our comms teams obviously don't work 24-7, and how do we message in those out-of-hours times when  People aren't there to necessarily post something on a website or update people through Facebook. So that's what that work is around, the predetermined messages, and it works on a sort of a push out process where it's centralised and it can go out quite quickly. So ongoing work with that, but we've been very much part of that as well.  Other than that, again, it's around\u2014 I guess the report focuses around COVID. Our welfare committees, certainly through WIPA, are very much involved with our meetings, staying in touch with MSD and providing that support where we can. But other than that, happy to take questions if there are any with regards to the report. Does anybody have any questions?",

It's a menu of things that we do, but of course, and the uptake of those with the new cell phones is the people replace their cell phones. I think that's really high. It's certainly in the late 80s, 90% of people that get those messages. And we also have the ability at a local level to drop in a message.  So we could do something, you know, if we end up with a water contamination or something like that in a particular area, we can drop in a message that only will ping within a, you know, a circumference. You know, we could put 10 kilometres around a particular area. So people driving into the area, they only get that message as soon as they're within that zone. So we can do all those sorts of things, but of course,  You know, we have communities that, you know, we're part of that shared service, the Maricopas, Mocows, you know, all those other pockets of our area or the country, really, that don't necessarily have great cell phone coverage.  So how do we reach those? And some of that push, that alerting, actually can be sort of set up with predetermined phone calls, you know, to a landline, those sorts of things as well. So it's really just improving  how we do it, and also it's around consistent messaging. So you get the same message wherever you are. Yeah. But certainly the cell phone is a great, that's a great improvement in terms of how quickly that message goes off. And I think we all, when it sounds, we've all got used to it. That's quite a distinctive noise when it goes off, grabs your attention. Yeah. Yes.",

    "text": " Thanks, Madam Chair. Yep, just following up on our recovery report, and quite clearly we're not in the recovery mode that we were earlier in the year with the Delta variant making its way in. So, yeah, slightly different report this time, and probably looking a little more at our response to that than our recovery from last year.  So first, just want to note the recovery fund. Remember that council created a $400,000 fund last year to receive applications, principally related to projects recovering from, that were hit by COVID in the first round.  We allocated $141,000 of that last year to five different applicants. And we discussed that with council yesterday, just how, in light of the Delta variant and what's happening at the moment, how they wanted to proceed with that. The second tranche of that was gonna be an application only,  only process and  Really in light of what's happened, I think the council view was that we shouldn't be proceeding with making those allocations or following up those applications and seeking new ones. What we're looking at doing is seeing where we can invest that for, I guess, the best good that we can get in three particular areas  And the areas the councillors wanted to look at were community safety, business support, particularly in the retail and hospitality areas, which have been really hard hit, and also to see whether there was still anything we could do to support improving the vaccination rate within Waip\u0101.  So I'm really interested in any feedback you might have on those three areas that council is suggesting it wants to put those investments into. We've had some discussions already with the community safety groups and also have some ideas that are coming through from the chambers of commerce as well.  So well hooked into those those areas. So I'll come back to that at the end anyway. Yeah, just in terms of the social. I guess the social response we noted that.  There does seem to be quite a difference from the response last year to this year. It's more of a government-led, particularly MSD and health-led response this time, rather than the emergency management  to response that we had last time. However, we did notice there were some issues just in communications with some of those agencies, but Gina and Corinna have been doing a great job in working with, particularly with health department, DHB, and we've made some good contacts there and making some good progress just in assisting the DHB within Waip\u0101 around  particularly the vaccination rollout and getting into some of those harder to reach areas. So that is I guess much, much.  much more progress than we indicated in the actual report itself. Just some other areas to note there. Community librarians are still working. They're funded by the National Library as part of their COVID response. They're providing online support at the moment.  preparing some local history content for the library's website. They have been working with dementia patients and they have received some additional funding about $10,000 for ebooks for teens and younger children.  Business response. So we've received just another update from Infometrics just this month looking at where things are likely to go. I think their view is that we can expect an uneven bounce back this time, the primary sector and construction sectors.  subject to supply chain issues, still going to be strong, but retail and hospitality accommodation are likely to be hardest hit out of this lockdown. So as I said, we're trying to see how we can support them.  I know Steve Tritt's got some retail webinars planned, so he's looking at rolling those out soon. And we're just looking at other areas we might be able to support employers as well. And as I said through there, looking at utilising that $250,000 remaining in the fund and the community safety  business support in vaccination areas. So happy to have any feedback you might have on those.",

So we have postponed those as per the update in the agenda. So the new times and dates are listed there. And we have committed, obviously, to not  progress to the construction stage without giving the community an opportunity to give us feedback on the plan. So that is a commitment that we're all sort of pretty, pretty strongly standing by, which is great. Last time we just discussed around the sausage sizzle, we decided the best approach was actually to really target  the users of the park. So everyone that is attending these sessions are going to be able to go into a draw for a new skateboard. So that was, yeah, so the team decided that was a really good angle. So that would be great. And then just the last thing, yeah, like in the report, it says that the kaitiaki groups have been established. So they're pretty keen to get involved in, obviously, you know, communication going out to say that we had to postpone. They were all pretty disappointed with that.

It's because we can't run the Christmas Parade, so the business  you know, people were very quick to come up with some suggestions about what could be done. And the Christmas tree lights were included, but obviously that's covered by Wi-Fi networks and better electrical. So the festive float thing is because we can't have floats. So it was thought it would be a competition for children to design a float.  in a shoebox. And the idea was that the children would design a Christmas float, but it's in a shoebox, and we would display those down the street in the different shop windows. So that gets people coming downtown to have a look and see what their kids or grandkids have done. And obviously there'd need to be a prize for that. So that was one. It was also suggested a satellite box. People could, you know, children could decorate their letterbox  ready for, well, obviously there'll be letterboxes around town for them to put their Christmas letters in, but they could also decorate their own letterboxes home, just to make sure that Santa knew exactly what the address was. So that was one of the suggestions. So there's been a few suggestions and, yeah, so I think we're just sort of wanting some, they just would like us to transfer that $2,000 towards  dressing up the town without a parade, just so that everybody knows it is Christmas. So I think they've got some really good ideas. It's just a matter of making sure they will get put up.",

I mean, without seeing a full budget, like they said, they need to work better. $2,000 seems generous for the activities that they are suggesting they do.  So that would be my only thought around, do we, you know, that's what website development, printing costs, prizes. So this seems like potentially that's a generous amount for what they're thinking about doing, which to me just sounds like lots of work for parents to do.  out and decorate. And I'm like, that's a cool idea, but I could probably do that from a Pinterest thing with them. Anyway, so I just, I have some concerns that 2000 might be on the high end. If just an idea I know was, Jim, you might be able to help me. Is it the Chamber of Commerce who did the window shop prize? Are they doing that again this year? What is the prize for that?

And I wonder if there's room for, if we've got $2,000 and we want to improve  and this is towards a Cambridge festivities type thing in the town. I just think of living in Melbourne and they'd have the Meyer shop Christmas window and you'd have people lined up, just strings of them to look at this amazing window display. I think it's great that our local businesses are gonna be doing it as well, but obviously there's a cost for them. And we also know our local businesses are being in a really difficult space, retail, hospitality, and anything like that's gonna involve extra cost. Just floating an idea to everybody,  is there room for the Cambridge Community Board to do something really cool and special and festive that's interesting and nice to look at and brings people into town to look at this?

Yes, Alana came and helped out and we kept it small just with the garden guardian, just in terms of color levels,  and just got some plants in the ground so that there's actually something for the community to enjoy as we get through the growing season. I've actually got a third site lined up, which will be a berm garden as opposed to a garden in our parks space.  So I don't know if any of you know Nick Turner from Mainstream Green. She's outside her place, so she's going to be the guardian for that. Unfortunately, this one involves a little bit more mahi to get set up. Previously, the parks team could build them for us because the gardens were on parks and reserves space.  because this is on a berm, we can't involve the parks team. So we're just looking at partnering with some local businesses who might be able to supply potting mix. So the council has offered to supply potting mix. It's just the challenge of, sorry, garden mix. It's just the challenge of getting it from their depot to this garden. So there's a couple of logistical things to iron out, but ideally in the next couple of weeks, we'll have that bed  in situ. And then again, we can't really involve a greater community. Obviously, we could do a group of 25. And to be fair, we'd be doing well to get 25 people to one of our plantings. So we may be able to open that up. I've also asked for someone to take over sort of the social media management of that project, someone from the community.  and I've got someone who's put their hand up and is quite interested to do that. So I think that's heading in the right direction. The more this can be like self-sustaining in the community, the better. Oh, that's brilliant.",

So one of them that I thought was really great was the Lakeside Reserve concept plans. So all of our water accesses down onto the Waikato River are being reviewed as to  their purposes and that the infrastructure is adequate for use. So there's probably been quite a long time since things like toilets upgrades, the quality of the ramps, the planting plan, the use of certain areas for campers were as in,  self-contained units, that type of thing, and just getting it more structured. So I think you can see a little bit of the first step of that is maybe the Hora Hora domain where they've defined quite clearly where to park your trailer and your boat trailer, et cetera, where they're camping overnight, people can park, keeping it safe or defined swimming spaces and things like that. So that's kind of the beginning of the ideas, but looking at all of the  different ones, and we've got two on the main highway, state one, and then the number up on the back road through to Bulmer's Landing, et cetera, right through. So yeah, I think it's a really good thing that's being done. It certainly needed to be done, and the use is not getting less, it's going up. So better infrastructure management is certainly an important step at this stage, yeah.  Let Wayne have a go now.",

So that's kind of underway with a lot of support from most of the councils. But it just goes on and it does look like it's just going to get rammed through.  I'm a bit aghast at some of the comments coming out from the Minister. She's talking about Papakainga and Marae having fresh, clean water for the first time, and I don't know how the heck or what the cost is if you're going to be taking that 40 kilometres out to some of the Marae or the Papakainga.  You know, that very, very much surprises me about the cost of doing that. Still not convinced that it's a viable option. And the biggest thing that's never been talked about is in my past case, we're going to lose 43 staff and support staff. So what do we do? Do we just concentrate on picking up rubbish and doing potholes?  we just lose that ability.
