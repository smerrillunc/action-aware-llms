Through the report, it talks about three to seven and that at the moment, type five plastic is also not so easy to get rid of or to recycle.

But there's, you know, there's there's buts in there that if Council continued to, you know, if for a time that type five plastic is likely to go to landfill until that market develops. So what we want to do with our programme is tell the public, hey, one and two, it's really easy to recycle and make sure that one is in your recycling bin.  Type 5, we expect that we will be able to recycle it in the future. So keep putting that in your bin. But if things change and the industry decides that it's not going to invest in equipment and processes to recycle Type 5, then we may have to cease collecting that as well. That's the worst case scenario. I'd like to think that we do keep collecting Type 5 and  in six months or 12 months, we will have a market for it. But there is that uncertainty there at the moment.",

It's one of the reasons why our  well, one of the many components of our increased proposed rates, and now they've somehow got wiggle room in the contract to not collect all of those classifications of plastic. My first question is, is that kind of normal to have that amount of wiggle room in a contract, or was it sort of, is it industry standard? And the second question is, if this is the case, then do we get a rebate on the amount, you know, because they're not actually collecting  I had understood we were contracted to be collecting in the first place.",

    "text": "Well, that's an interesting question. It's got a number of components to it, both in terms of how the contract works for recycling, but also in terms of what the resident would expect for the payment they make each year.  Under the contract, each commodity type, whether it's aluminium or tin or cardboard or different types of plastic and glass, all have a cost for collection and sorting and disposal. And then there is, provided there's a market for the materials, there is some income that comes from the sale of those materials that comes back and reduces the overall contract cost.  what we're finding because of the big changes in the recycling market and China refusing to take recycling material, that the cost of disposing of materials has gone up in that in certain circumstances for different materials, we're paying people to take the stuff away and so not getting any revenue. So we've got all of the costs of collection and sorting, but no revenue offsetting those costs.  So that's what all local authorities in New Zealand and around the world are struggling with, that where they once had some revenue coming in to offset the cost, now there is little or no revenue coming in. So if the people who will take the materials and recycle it charge much more than what it costs to put it in the landfill, then we have to be,  very careful about the decisions we make and the costs we put on our ratepayers to recycle materials. And with the types three to seven, when we're finding that a lot of the plastic is contaminated and so it can't even go to recycling, it just goes straight into a bin and into the landfill, then we have to think again as to whether we collect it at all.  In terms of overall volume, the type three to seven plastics is a relatively small volume in the overall recycling. So in terms of if there was a saving to the ratepayer for a smaller volume of material being collected, it would be measured in cents or a couple of dollars on the annual recycling cost. So it is a matter of economics.  and a matter of trying to deliver also the best value for the ratepayer. I hope that makes sense. Thanks, Brian.",

So maybe when we're going out with this  this comms education type programme around the changes, we need to try and make sure that people understand that that is actually the case. Because I mean, from a purely Joe Blow on the street perspective, it looks like you're charging me to take my stuff, now you're saying you're not taking it and you're telling me I have to put it in a bag that I also have to pay for to dispose of it. So they're looking like we're making, yeah, it could potentially be perceived as an increased financial cost on the ratepayer rather than  the situation you've set out.

I mean, Joe Bloggs is going to now put it in a yellow bag, as has been alluded to, not is it only going to be paid for, but it's going to end up in the same place that it would have if we continued doing exactly what we're doing. So I actually, apart from a PC,  I cannot see why there's a change to this, because it's going to end up being in the same landfill, whether the council collection, you know, our contractors put it in there or I as an individual put it in there. And my second point is at the top of page three, it looks like to sort all those other plastics, which is over half, the cost is only ten to fifteen thousand dollars, which to me seems a little unbelievable.  have to sort through every bit of plastic and sort these numbers out.

So it may not be a true reflection and it's quite difficult to actually calculate a true cost in terms of that quantity, sorting costs and then landfill costs, because there is a percentage of materials that we always expected would be contaminated and would have to go to landfill anyway.  And so it's not so easy to make a hard and fast estimate of that value. I think if we were to carry on collecting and saying to people, just put any type of plastic in the recycling, we lose the opportunity to educate the public and change consumer behaviour. Part of the reason why there is so much plastic in our  households and supermarkets and everything is simply because people perceive there to be no cost or environmental impact by using lots and lots of plastic.

    "text": "Yes. So, again, if I can take the report as read and many councillors will be familiar with the Section 17a review of council services.  when these types of long running contracts come up for review, there's an obligation on council to complete this review and make sure we're still delivering the services in an appropriate fashion for our community. So, a range of options are always looked at for these types of contracts, whether they should be in standalone contracts, whether they should be  amalgamated with larger contracts across the council, whether they should be delivered by council staff and council owning the equipment and running it, or whether it could be delivered in tandem with another local authority, a neighbour, or whether we deliver it under a standalone contract, as we have traditionally done.  So, the options assessment there talks about the type of work done, page two and three, emptying litter bins, sweeping streets, collecting leaves, cleaning bus stops, that sort of thing. We do that because it is a core service for councils to complete this type of work. It is  also subsidised by the transport agency. And it fits with our activity management plan that we provide clean streets. It also ties into making sure we meet our stormwater discharge consent conditions and that we clean out catch pits and sweep streets to reduce the load of sediment that would otherwise wash into waterways from our urban areas. So, those are all the reasons that we  we do this work. In terms of our present arrangement, so we've had, well, I guess all the time that I have worked at council and that's over 20 years now, we have typically had a standalone type contract to provide these services. And that's because there are specialist contractors out there that do this sort of work.  The sweeper trucks that you see on the roads sucking up the materials and sweeping and sucking out some things are very expensive and high maintenance bits of equipment. And the workforce has peaks and troughs of work and there's a lot of manual work involved.  And we've traditionally decided that this is better done with a contract rather than having staff and equipment, buying that expensive equipment and doing it ourselves. And also, because we collect transport agency subsidy for this activity, the transport agency requires if council was to do it itself, that we would have to have a local authority trading enterprise, a separate business  undertaking this work if we wanted to do it in-house. Otherwise, we have to put it out to competitive tender as per their procurement rules. So, I guess that's the background to it and the reasons why we've traditionally done it the way we do it. And the recommendation of this report is that we continue to do it  as we have done in the past and prepare a new contract document and go out to tender. So, I'm happy to take questions on this now.",

One of the options is the shared services, and it mentions that there have been discussions with Otorohanga, and that was seen not to be a reasonable option. But it doesn't mention, are there any of the cities or councils within the Waikato region that are actually doing the shared services agreement, like Hamilton, Waikato?",

I know that Waikato District and Hamilton City have both set up alliance contracts, so they're long running 10-year contracts that have basically incorporated all of the road maintenance work into one contract in each of those councils. And because of that fact, that would be very difficult for council to  in a fashion, break into that contract and engage them to, you know, carry out this discrete service for us. We do obviously share some contracts, though, with Waikato District Council, the transport agency in Hamilton City, and that is in terms of the bridge management, traffic signal maintenance and our Rata  to run this contract that certainly isn't at the moment the right time to go back for a tender.",

What I'd like to see happen through the community boards is some input into the extent of the cleaning and the CBD, just in terms of some of the periphery where, you know, there's a lot of people who are going to be going back to work. So, I'm not unhappy about that.  I, as a walker, every morning have seen at least three choke points in Cambridge that require that little bit of extra cleaning without me having to ring council and ask them to do those particular areas. So would we be able to have an input into that when that new contract comes up?",

I acknowledge that there's been a change in our town centres and with growth, and it might be  applicable to extend some of the more intensive cleaning that happens in the town centres because of that growth.

But what it also does for us as councillors is that when we, you know, receive complaints or when we  get sometimes criticised for some of the levels of service and value for money. And this is where the 17A reviews are really, really great. And it's a checklist for us to go back and ensure that we're providing the best value for money for our residents. So I'm happy to move the recommendations A, B, and C. And yeah, thanks for that update, Brian.",
