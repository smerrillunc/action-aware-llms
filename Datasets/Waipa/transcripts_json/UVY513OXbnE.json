We're reporting on our last financial year, 1 July to 30 September 2023, on how well the trust has gone and we're going to talk about the non-financial report and our audited financial numbers as well. So total visits, a huge increase  due to non-COVID, I think it was the first year after COVID where we haven't been restricted. We did have the first three months of the year to about midway through September under some restrictions, but it didn't really affect us as much. It did have some effect on probably schools and then adjusting, coming back from COVID and what they were going to do outside of the classroom.  and attendance and things like that. But you can see a big significant jump. We're almost 360,000 people through both facilities together. And it was a huge increase over the last three years. If you look at 2019-2020, that was the Te Ahamuru Events Centre only, and that's when COVID also hit in March-April. I'm going to talk about the Events Centre by itself.  212,000 people through. Once again, it's a big step up from the 136, so you can really see the impact that COVID had on us and affected all services, not only the pools, but the stadium, the gym and things like that. So 75,000 visitor increase or 55% over last year.  pools only. This is the Te Amaru Event Centre, Livingstone Aquatics only. 130,000 people through, so probably the best gauge would be year 2020-21.  You can see the drop there. Some of that will be with Perry Aquatic Center coming on board. We would have that. So the next couple of years would be a good indicator how we're going and what programs we're putting in to help increase and boost those numbers back up. But yeah, another 38,000 increase over the previous year. Stadium, that was probably one of the most affected areas, especially with the  physical distancing and what they could do and things like that. We couldn't play any sports and very hard to maintain hygiene and things like that. So last year or the year prior to last was very poor with 8,000 right through that year, we were closed for a number of those months and we had 30,000, which was a little bit disappointing, even though it's higher than the previous years. If anyone knows, we had an incident for the first term of this,  calendar year, school year. We have the floor maintained in the stadium and one of the products failed.  The blessing out of that was because the product failed, they actually sanded back all the wood and we just were just doing the top surface. They sanded it right back to bare wood and we got new courts and new thing under insurance. So, you know, win-win. So we don't have to do that, but we lost the term of local sports and events because of that. Getting in, no one wanted to do half a term of pretty hard for the organizers to use.  So yeah, we had 22,000 more. We're hopefully going to be quite a bit higher than that this year. So hopefully this time next year we'll be presenting with even better numbers for the stadium.  For anyone that's new and doesn't know Club Waipa, Club Waipa is our gym services, wet and dry, so they do obviously the physical gym side, but they also do group fitness classes, both dry and wet, so aqua jogging, and that also includes some classes over in the Piri Aquatic Centre, which is a aquatic facility over only.  So we had 57,000 people through. Once again, you can see the asterisks of the COVID. So it's about 15,000. So everybody's starting to come back to some sort of normality on the visit. So we're quite happy with that. Membership was over 900, which is quite good with a densely populated fitness gym. I think there's about seven gyms.  If you count CrossFit and TA. So yeah, it's pretty saturated market.  Getting onto Pere Aquatic Centre, which is kind of nice to know because ever since the Pere Aquatic Centre opened, we were straight into COVID, so we've always been restricted besides the current last year. So a big step up, 147,000, almost 150,000 people through. And once again, it's aquatics based only, so it's doing pretty well for just pools. And if we have a bumper summer, hopefully we do really well.  swim school does really well if we have a lot of drownings the swim schools seem to do quite well so generally summer it's it's water yeah very sad the water restrictions and drowning seem to be a big issue over the summer so it's having that capacity to that and being a landlocked area  You know, having safe waterways to swim in is pretty limited. So we hope that the centres that we provide will be well used.",

We did have, unfortunately, some misinformation about pricing, which was incorrect. They'd said that they were going to Morrinsville and saying that we were charging $5,000 for a swim meet or an event at the school. So, hopefully, we have nullified that and we went through  The iSite in Cambridge, they brought the request through somebody else and we provided that information to them. Generally the schools are our regular users like St Pat's, the intermediates. Sometimes we actually go to some of the schools that have pools and deliver on site there. Sorry, I'm not as prepared. I'm just trying to remember off the top of my head. And a couple of the smaller schools as well.  I can provide that information later on.

    "text": " There's two parts to that. If we're talking on the swimming side, for normal fees and charges and just general casual entry, we kind of look around the market and also the service and the facilities we are providing.  Put it this way, I live in Hamilton, and I think our services in the Waip\u0101 region are far better than anything Hamilton offers. So I don't apologise that maybe our entry prices are, but for the water safety, boat safety, we generally get funding from Water Safety New Zealand. Our stadium prices are very cheap. I think they're too cheap for what we provide, because we've invested quite heavily, say, on the floor, new shot clocks, upgrading the facilities and things like that.  because it's not based on the person in the stadium, it's based on courts or a flat rate and would be a lot cheaper than our competition.  but we're kind of a smaller market with Mystery Creek and Claudelands, things like that. And there's a bit tough with some infrastructure to bring some stuff in, hence why we're looking at trying to provide and get our niche in the market and try and fill those spaces where we're quiet. It is tough when most people are at school or at work to fill the stadium during the day, easy after school.  and have to work but um but harder and in weekends we really want to have something going on the weekends and trying to have if it's not sport some sort of event going and we're hoping that the new person who does get that role will focus on trying to deliver that.",

One of the things that we did do in the year prior to last year  when we were very heavily restricted, we were only allowed a hundred people at any one time in the facility. We're still trying to prioritise the swimming lessons and get the kids through and to say to the parents, oh, you can pick them up at the end and things like that. That was a big challenge, but it also affected obviously the stadium, even the gym capacities and things like that. And we also had to look at our partners like the cafe and allowing them to still operate and have some people as well.  So yeah, total membership at the end of last year was 1755. We put through 47,000 swimming lessons. And then obviously you can see the swim for life or the boat safety water safety course about 2700, which we'd really love to do better in that one. Squads about 5000 and in our holiday programs 1500.  And if you look at that, that's a step up from the previous year. You can see about 250-240 people more in our swim school. Swimming lessons were almost 9000 more. Doubled, almost tripled our boat safety, water safety, and then the squads doubled. So we're slowly getting there. We just gotta keep pushing and striving for those.  health and safety. While these numbers may seem reasonably high, a lot of them are first aid and things like that, but we've had 360,000 people through the facility. So if you put that into perspective and the nature of our business, i.e. people are fun, happy, active, they're not just going and sitting there. Kids just want to be kids and things like that.  One of the key things that we did do in there is the trespass. I've talked to Sally and Brad about this after COVID and things like that. The nature of people and their behaviors is quite.  changed quite a bit and so we struggled a little bit and I've been in the industry for about 20 years and you normally get maybe one or two trespassers, sometimes none a year and just last year we had 11 just with behaviors and abuse and fighting and all sorts of theft and things like that.",

Our focus is to deliver a good product and watch their safety,  trying to do that. I think we do struggle with some of the support services after that as well, and then the follow up. They're there to help, but the follow up and things like that. For example, last week we had a car stolen and it was a cops car. So when we took the CC and the evidence to the police, we didn't get the vibe and I'm not trying to blame the police. They got a busy job.  to follow up with that. And, you know, it was one of these that got the vehicle stolen. You'd think that they'd be quite proactive. So I think their resources are stretched as well, which is pretty tough. So I don't know if that's the same as what the council's found, but we just found the general behaviour of the public seems to have shifted.

    "text": " So if we put this into perspective, besides the trespassers, 91 accidents. So what we call an accident is where we provide first aid for somebody. An incident might be something like you've left your car lights on, the battery's gone flat or a theft or something like that. Or we have a fight and then you punch me in the nose and I break my nose. That's an incident going to an accident.  So we had 91 accidents, 45 incidents, 83 contaminations. So if you divide that, I'll put 17 days there. What I mean by that, if you average out a vomit or a code brown or some blood in the pool, we average it out about three hours of that pool being closed. And so if you do that and we're open for 15 hours a day, which worked out to being about 17 days of interruptions through people.  And it happens more often than you're not. You'll get people, my kids are toilet trained and it's too late, but things like that. Or they'll vomit, have a lot of vomits through, you know, get this down your gut. We're late for swimming lessons. Then they go for a swim and it comes back up. You just have to follow the protocol.  Well, we're always trying to get them better and they were up on last year. We're also up by about 95,000 people. So put it into perspective, they're pretty good.  pool water quality. It's kind of tough because we always exceed the pool water quality. The standard is 85% average of maintaining in the standard. It's a national standard of keeping it in, and so we may manage to maintain the water quality about 95% within that framework.  pool temperatures once again, trying to keep them in anyone here is regular swimming. You probably have your preference. We do get some feedback on. I want the lane to be this temperature for myself and I want it for myself. So if you're faster swimming, quite a good swimmer, they generally like it colder because they're working harder. If you're a bit like me and just like to walk up and down, it can be a bit cold, so you're never going to please everybody. But we try and stay in those standards and the standards  presentation. Feedbacks. So we get a lot of feedback, mainly probably verbal. And so we can't validate that. So when we say feedback and it's presented, it's actual written feedback that we've had to respond to because we get a ton of feedback where our regulars come in and praise us, but on reverse of that, I'm sure when they're not happy and they tell someone,  If I get grout, I'm not really going to tell my boss that I got grout sort of thing. So these are based on that. So we had nine compliments, which is disappointing. We'd love to see a lot more of those. Complaints valid, 11. Non valid, a nine. So there's some ridiculous ones why you can't do this. There's just no answer for them. There's no way. And we have a lot of suggestions. We had about 21 of those.  Yeah, if I want to lean to myself, we just can't do that with public facilities. So capital renewals. So last year we had a big year with some bigger projects.  And with funding from Council and the trust putting it in, we put some AC units into our electrical room and staff room. The electrical room gets very hot down the plant room and just to stop it overloading. And then we put one in the staff room, which would be nice for them because it's north facing and gets pretty hot.  So to then actually have a break and have some air conditioning for the staff was quite good. Hydro slide refurbishment. So that's a big one.  We had $85,000 set aside for the new stairwell and some money for some hydro slides, but the stairwells went up over around the $260,000 to redo the stairs in the Te Amarere Vent Centre. These are minus GST numbers as well.  Auto Rewind, which is the machine that rolls in the 50 meter cover in the pack. We did a lighting replacement, so if anyone's been to the stadium recently, not only we've done the floor, we've done all the lighting above it and it's all LED now, so it's a lot brighter. And also when we turn or lose power, but mainly when we turn them off, they don't have to take time to cool down and then warm back up to come back on. So we got instant levels of service back for people a lot better.  Over the time, we put another shot clock in scoreboard on one of the courts, so we got both courts that can run for the public now not just the main one.  Our main heating and ventilation fresh air fan that brings in all the air packed up. That wasn't a scheduled one, so we use that. And then the main circulating pumps for the 25 meter pool and the hydro slide. And in the office, I don't know if anyone's been to the event center. We were just online for about eight or nine years. So it gets quite cold in the winter and quite warm in the summer. So we put carpet and made it a bit nicer for the staff.  And then some gym equipment. We always continue to upgrade the gym and provide better service. And when the peri-aquatic center got built, the learn to swim hydrotherapy pool faces most of the sun and it gets low, especially in the winter months and can get an eye sun strike. And so even for the instructors and the people, also the people sitting, so we kind of tinted that and made it a bit easier. New price words and then there was a vehicle replacement, which is part of our schedule.  So, total spent was just $407,000. The remaining money will go on to the HydroSlide when we get a chance to redo that job. You can see some photos of the new stadium floor and the lighting, and then we had a  Iwi leaders forum just recently, and it's one of the set up so you can see what it looks like. They went for about three or four days. The Prime Minister was supposed to arrive on the last day of it. Unfortunately it was foggy and he got missed out. But it was well run and they had shops and little things that they were selling.",

It goes out for three weeks and we had 707 responses, so it was down on last year's responses by about 359, but still quite a good catchment of 707 over that three weeks of the users.  Our customer satisfaction index rating was 77. 78 is very good, so we're one off it, but it went up one from last year to good performance, but always room and potential for improvement.  And you know, one of the challenges that we are working on and looking at going forward is having besides our main one is having regular ones, specially on little events and then sending out a maybe two or three questions survey to see how they found. So we get better feedback because once again, it's how the customer feels on the day. And generally people aren't.  And we go down into detail. It's not just based off one or two questions. We do it on every question, so we want to know what our customer feels. If you go to learn to swim, did the instructor engage the parent and the child? Not just things. So if you do some other surveys, they will do two or three top questions and they'll base the overall score. Ours is based on a whole lot. Were you greeted at the door? Things like that.  We're pretty tough markers on ourselves, and we don't apologize for that, I guess.",

    "text": "It's a real opportunity, I would have thought. Yeah, 100%. So it's gone up one point or 1% over last year.  But you can see the consistency. The big improver was actually the gym. We had a challenge the previous year with our club Waipahu. We had some changes of personnel and consistencies there, which obviously we weren't proud of, but something we strove to do.  and do quite well. So we had some stability there and now our memberships kind of reflects that. So we're hoping that, you know, in the upcoming one and it goes out in February, you know, to see it still continue to drive and rise there. Now we get into the financial. I apologize in advance, I'm not Merv. Merv's the numbers guy and what a charismatic guy.  We just about broke even. We were always quite proud operationally to be slightly ahead of council. We always try and get above the 50% this year. I think we were 49.6% and council was 50.4%. And I'm having sleepless nights over that. So it's something that we want to do. But if we look at what we did last year, we had a net surplus based on the budget. We still need council's on the rate payers funding of $452,000.  not counting because we have to include the capital renewal funding that we got. So there's 250 something left over for that project that we're still going to finish with the slide. So that's included in the 452. So realistically it will be around or thereabouts the same as the previous year, around the 200,000 mark, 230. The one that I really like to look at is probably this one here. And you can see the difference in the numbers.  Council funding, we've got 2.7 for both facilities or it's 50.25. So 0.25 is the difference and then we made 2.706.  If you look at the users, visits per user in the subsidy that the ratepayer does is $7.60. And we did $7.52, so it's roughly costing, if they didn't get subsidised by the ratepayer to use the facility, it's about $15.12 per person to use. So if you're a full paying adult,  of $8 might be $8.50. I can't remember. I think it's $8 and it normally would cost $15. That's the difference that we're saving them each visit. And that's based on the total rateable units.  And then you can see that's gone up. So obviously with the growth across the Waip\u0101 you can see another 500 units that pay in rates. So the annual cost of the ratepayer is $227,000. The trust is covering 113 of that and then the 114 of that would be  and their rates, so not too bad. And then the equity has risen from 87, so the rate payers getting back about 87 on their money. We've made that to 104 and we've got an equity based over there of almost two and a half million.",

It's fantastic to see the facilities being maintained and improved.  Yes, there's a cost to doing that, but boy, there's a bigger cost to not doing it, in my view. So yeah, well done.

It took, you know, from the previous government when they said they were going to change the rule it took three years for them from start to when they, the new rule came out. I mean it is possible that  the large part of the rule stays as it is, and the new government might just tweak it a bit. I think some of the controversy has arisen around the country, particularly around speed limit changes on state highways. And that's been the most controversial and perhaps the area where that whole impact of economic efficiency, which has been talked about, you know, really comes to the fore. Whereas on our local roads and urban streets and things, that's probably not going to be an issue, I don't think.  So, I think any work that we do now, between now and when we start to make any changes will still be very good work because we'll probably tend to be looking at those local roads and those low volume roads and things as a first step.",

So it's really once you get into the countryside where  a 30k speed limit is probably not practical, then it's considered that category two school. So again, I guess because many of our schools already have that lower 40k speed limit, there is a bit of time in the new rule in terms of when we have to make decisions about changing the speed limit.  But there'll be, I guess, a lot of places where it's a, you know, a no-brainer to make it 30. Like the new school being developed in the C2 growth cell, the road environment and speed tables and things have all been designed specifically for 30. So it will just naturally become 30 when it opens. But there's others, perhaps, where it's more difficult, Te Mutu College,  say. Schools on very busy main roads where it's not, you know, so easy to implement a 30, you know, a Hapo school by State Highway 3 and a Hinepuri school on State Highway 39, that's where there'll be, I guess, some, you know, more careful consideration will be needed as to what the options are.",
