While we won't be doing the capital projects, we're not sure until we've  that we might need to cover. So, we just can't give certainty on that. Now, the second thing, funds are not available at the moment for arbitrage purposes. The funding.  the moment is quite tight, and our GFA have made it very clear that they will lend for core debt only, they're not lending for arbitrage purposes at the moment, as well as with the interest rates as they are, you know, we'd be looking at probably less favourable arrangements anyway.

I'll take the report as read.  but just make the comment that whilst this might not seem a priority in current circumstances, we were keen to formalise the direction that Council had indicated last year in the use of the Macron and also there's quite a bit of work to get a remit to LGNZ. I wasn't actually aware that the AGM had been deferred for 12 months. I wasn't sure whether it was going to be held.  at all later in the year, but if that's the case, if it's been deferred for 12 months, then we'll work on that timeline. What we've been trying to look here, really, is to avoid every council having to go through what is quite a lengthy, complex process, particularly if we are just looking to use a macro, and I think it might be different if you're coming up with a completely new name for your council. So, we did some work with Simpson Grierson and got some advice on some options from them,  but consider that this is a matter that should be raised by LGNZ with DIA to look at those options and find a solution for local government. So, just looking to keep things simple. Obviously, the hope now is that we can go to a Zone 2 meeting to get support there rather than having to go round up and round up some other council support.  which was going to be the case because of a tight timeframe if we had been heading for this year's LGNZ AGM. But we're going to have a bit more time now to work through this process. But happy to take any questions on what's in the report.",

It has been canvassed with Waikato Tainui. There is a variance in how they want the  the pronunciation, I suppose, recognised. So, at the moment, the recommendation that's come forward is the Macron, but we're just going to put that on hold with the additional recommendation E in there just to go back to Waikato-Tainui.

Also to add a sentence at the end of the representation review arrangements, just to note that councils can initiate reviews earlier than their statutory timeframes if they wish.

So a fairly simple two page terms of reference for the housing working group that was established at the 10th of December meeting of the Finance and Corporate Committee for the first time halfway through last month.  So, yeah, so the working group considered what they thought an appropriate terms of reference should be, and that's the document in front of you. So, this is really just looking for council to approve the terms of reference as it's stated. I think the key things are that this is, I guess, this housing working group has replaced  what was previously known as the Pensioner Housing Working Group. So a deliberate change in name to reflect the potential for a wider purpose. So, you know, consideration of social and affordable housing. So that's, yeah, that's the key thing. But, yeah, apart from that, yeah, fairly standard terms of reference. This is a purely advisory group. It is not subject to standing orders.  But, yeah, but it's a, yeah, essentially it's a group that can work through issues in regard to housing and provide recommendations back to either council or its committee. Greg Morgan Thanks, Ken.",

So, yeah, T6 and T11, these have been hanging around for a little while now, and today we're hoping to sort of close that loop by asking for your endorsement of those draft structure plans.  So I will take this report as read, but I do have some key points that I would just like to run through, if I may. And the first is that this is a non-statutory process. We've developed these draft plans in consultation with partners such as Mana Whenua,  and other key stakeholders like New Zealand Transport Agency, Waikato Regional Council, landowners and developers in both of these growth cells. We have obviously also sought wider feedback last year that closed, I think off the top of my head, it was about October last year that our public feedback for these draft structure plans closed.  And we do have some landowners in both of these growth cells who are willing to develop and would like to develop. Just last week for the T11 growth cell, which is around the pack and save in Te Amutu, wrapped around there, there was a pre-application meeting with the majority landowner in that growth cell. They are very keen to go.",

Just during our work up to this plan, Pouto and particularly myself, I questioned the logic of having 168 hectares into large lot residential  and he said he made a mistake by doing that.

It doesn't do that. It doesn't do that. It doesn't do that. It doesn't do that. It doesn't do that.  And I'm really, really concerned that there's been no provision made for a more dense lot of housing within this 420 acres. In fact, there's no commentary on it at all.  The thing that makes me think that it should happen more is that you actually, it's in between Te Aumudu and Kihikihi, where you have your water and your sewage going right there. And I just think that it needs to go on hold. I know you've talked to a lot of people, but we really, really need to reconsider whether we're putting this amount of land into large lot residential.",

And so decided to focus those people who wanted large lot residential into enclaves where we could provide services like refuse collection and  the trickle feed water supplies. So we effectively adopted a compromise where we said no more rural residential subdivision out in the elite soils and let's focus this development into enclaves. Now, I understand what you're saying when you say Graham, that there is no commentary on the fact that this is all large lot residential, but effectively that all happened when the district plan was put into effect.  All that we're seeking today is for approval that the structure plan that is where the roads go, how is the stormwater managed? How do we put all that in place to allow the development to occur? So, effectively, the district plan decision in relation to is this large lot residential or not was made when we adopted the district plan.",
