So if we're saying, let's say, using the breast cancer example,  they've paid for or they're planning to have it paid to be lit up and then someone comes in with a later booking, do we say oh now we're going to remove the lighting because there's a booking. There probably needs to be some clarity around who takes precedence in that matter and I question whether an event really does take precedence over what is probably a  bigger community goal in terms of lighting it either for a national day or an awareness day. And you know what, a pink town hall could look awesome in photos at nighttime. So I just think we probably need some clarity around if there's an event, who wins? Is it the schedule and the paid for lighting? Or is it that event? And my first instinct would be to say that the event doesn't take precedence over  lighting it could even make their event more interesting depending on how it's lit that's just my opinion happy to hear that other thoughts i just i guess it would depend on who booked first um and and if there was lighting planned that you would hope if someone was trying to then book the town hall that they'd made be made aware that this is happening at that time rather than i think that's fair yeah yeah yeah i don't think canceling the lighting makes sense just if someone else's  Chucking something in there.",

Just make sure, sorry, just make sure my microphone's down. I don't know whether you heard any of that. Just introducing myself, Graeme Pollard, Strategic Projects Driver. This is a new bylaw. We haven't got an annual, an animal nuisance bylaw at the moment. We are currently consulting. Consultation opened on the 12th of  November, so that was since your previous meeting, and it closes on the 13th of December, so we've still got 12 days if you wish to put any submission in on this. We've already had a number of submissions, which is really good, so that's a heads up for our councillors in the meeting that you will have something to look at next year. This by-law derives from  And the plan change commissioners that decision said that they didn't feel that was the district plan is an appropriate place for the beekeeping rules and that they'd be better off in a bylaw as a means of managing the nuisance from the bees rather than managing the bees themselves. So we've  drafted this bylaw, we're taking the opportunity as well to include the other animal keeping rules that are currently in the district plan. And then at some future date, they will be the subject of a plan change and have them removed from the district plan. Basically, the nuisance caused by any animals wherever they are in the district is already covered.  We're not including dogs in this or wild animals or pests. And as someone said to me, nor people. So I think a bit tongue in cheek, but you never know. We do have some additional provisions that apply in urban areas. Those are the residential zones and the large lot residential zones as defined in the district plan.  And these additional provisions are for keeping of bees, pigs, and poultry. And those main provisions are highlighted in the agenda, in the report, page two of my report, which I think is page 17 of your agenda.  we are recognizing, particularly from some of the submissions that we've seen already, that there are some keepers of bees or pigs or poultry in the urban zone already.  that are going to be affected by this. So you may well have people coming and talking to you about this, or you may know of people already who may be affected. So very conscious that we might have those kinds of effects. The information that we've got, this statement of proposal and the draft bylaw are available on the council website.  we've got to have your say page on the website. They're also available in council offices and libraries. We have an online submission form, and we have a printable form online as well. And as I say, these submissions close 13th of December. And with that, I'm happy to try answering any questions that the board may have. Thank you, Chair.",

Just from reading the information included, it said that  that sort of two meter height only needed to be one to two meters from the entrance to the hive. So my question was why the beehives forced three to five meters in from the fence line? Just like a little nugget of information about bees. Flight path management. Honeybees can be encouraged to fly above head height if a flyaway barrier two or more meters tall is placed one to two meters out from the front of the hive entrance. So I was just wondering if that's  as much space as they need, why are we forcing the beehives deeper into people's sections? Was there another reason for that?",

    "text": " Thank you, Madam Chair. The report is at page 37 in the agenda, so I can take the report as read. It is an information report. There was one recommendation to the Service Delivery Committee to support the Waikato Speed Limit Review on the Waikato Expressway, which will allow the speed to increase to 110 kilometres an hour when they've finished the remaining safety improvement works there.  Then onto the following page, the transportation programme for the year, there's a list of projects which has been updated showing the projects we're working on for the year. So the pavement reconstruction is sort of in design phase with the first contract out to tender at the moment.  The resurfacing work is going on around the district. A lot of the asphalting work's already been done, and you will have seen some of that in the centre of Cambridge and on Albert Street. And chip sealing work has been going on since early October as well. So if you haven't seen that in your part of Cambridge yet, you will before long.  The seal extension program, of course, we've only just got that one that was held over from last year, low road, which is in the contract that's out to tender at the moment. And we aim to award that contract before Christmas, but with work starting in the new year.  Then there's a list of construction improvements. The footbridge in Te Amitu is in place. We're just waiting to connect that up with footpath. We've got two projects underway in Ohaupo, being works around the school for their pedestrian safety improvements, and also a project in the center of Ohaupo for a new traffic signal controlled crossing point for pedestrians.  Then in Te Amutu on Cambridge Road, a roundabout in design, and of course our Te Awa cycleway, which is making great progress along the riverbank there. Park staff and myself are actually going to go for a cycle early next week to have a look at how it's going and look at how it's being finished off for maintenance and everything into the future.  Of course, our Hamilton Road corridor improvements with the footpath and cycleway were completed in November. There is one or two items there that we weren't able to complete under that contract. One is a speed table across the intersection of Bryce Street and Hamilton Road that links up the shared path each side.  We have every intention of still completing that this financial year and also some traffic calming measures in Vogel Street near the Rest Haven village. The CCTV extension, there's an item further on in the report about that, but basically we are sort of hitting pause on new work there until we've completed a bit of a strategy moving forward so that we make sure we make the investments in the right place.  And we've engaged some experts, Safer Cities, who have been involved with a lot of these types of schemes for local authorities to give us some expert advice on our objectives and strategy going forward.  Streetlight upgrading, there's a small amount of streetlight upgrading planned for the year, and that's because that work has not been funded by Waki Kotahi, so it'll just be half of that budget, which is the local share that we have available to do that work.  Yeah, then in the next page there's a bit more detail about some of those things that I've talked about already. In the footpath renewal space we have engaged a consultant to repeat the three yearly condition survey. So that's where they have a little electric buggy that travels over all the footpaths  They record all the faults, they take video of it and give us a really good up-to-date condition survey of the whole footpath network that will then help us to plan footpath repairs and renewals going forward for the next three years. So we expect to have that data early in the new year to help us plan ahead.  Then there follows some information about the Community Road Safety Program and the activities that will happen there. Of course, quite a lot of stuff has had to have been postponed because of COVID and being unable to do that sort of community education face to face, but we'll do our best to catch that up when we're able to.  And there was a bit of advice about the passenger transport, which was in a separate report actually to the Service Delivery Committee. But in summary, we're getting a little bit more information now from the Regional Council  from the Bcard data. So that's when people swipe on and swipe off the bus. And so we do see within Cambridge that I think about 10% of the trips are internal trips. So people just going from one side of Cambridge to the other, with the remainder of the trips being, you know, going further afield outside of the urban area. In the future we'll get more and more  accurate data about how many trips are made. And of course, when the COVID issues relax and people get back on the buses, we'll have more information as well.",

As I go down the end of this road pass up towards Cambridge East Primary School, there's a raised crossing. Now, all of a sudden you're there. I mean, you go across,  William Street or somewhere, and there's a yellow and black thing across the road, you don't mind that, you bump over that. It's not William Street, it's the other one before then. But then you get close to the primary school, and where there used to be a marked pedestrian crossing, there is now a bit of a hump in the road, so you know you've got to slow down a bit because the kids are crossing. But there's no warning to say, pedestrian crossing, there's no stripes, you're there, and hello. And I'm just wondering whether we shouldn't be  Just in the interest, you know, you start at one end of that block and there's the yellow and black striped stuff across the road. And then you're coming along, you're probably picking up speed a bit by then, despite the fact you're hitting the school area. And all of a sudden there's this raised crossing that the kids are using, but there's no stripe, there's no nothing, there's no sign, there's nothing. So what are we doing about that? Shouldn't we actually be  making that slightly safer.",

OK, I'll have to check in with my staff because it should have some paint markings on it to show that it is a raised crossing there, and it should have a sign that indicates a speed table or a speed hump. That should be there. I haven't noticed them.  So what we find in outside schools, we have kia crossings, particularly primary schools. So they are crossings that are patrolled and they have signs out when they're being used. And that is safest because what we find is that  children using a zebra crossing is generally less safe, and there's more chance of them being run over on a zebra crossing than there is on a kia crossing. But I'll certainly check with my staff about, you know, that the speed table have all the appropriate markings and signs gone on it. I know we obviously had the Streets for People project around the two crossings outside the Cambridge East Primary School,  which had the planter boxes and the safe hit posts and the paint at the side of the road to encourage people to slow down.",

For instance, the yellow lines by ASB Bank, if you're aware of them, sort of between the bank and Cummins Pharmacy on the main street, they  more often than not um there is an extra car park on top of that which narrows the lane down into Halley's Lane and some dear old people that have the angels watching over them have their entry into Halley's Lane narrowed um going to the car park out the back it's just a there is going to be a collision there there was one a bit further along a while ago  an old man was just got all confused with all the traffic. Are we allowed to put curbing around there and either put a garden there or put a concrete mound there so people can't park in that bit? Also, by the pedestrian crossing on Duke Street, outside Oxford's, the optometrist, that right there, the takeaway cafe place. Regularly,  you walk past there and someone's just nose straight in behind the last car park on the yellow dotted lines with their bum end of their ute, van, car, whatever, onto the pedestrian crossing because they want to run into either the bank or the glasses shop or generally the pie shop. The third one is along on the corner of the  Cambridge Primary on the corner of Wilson and around there where those yellow, sorry, orange bollards are standing up. The bollards are doing great things because cars aren't parking right on the corner. They just, unfortunately, haven't stopped them. They just park a little bit further out into the street now. And the fourth one is on the corner of Accountant 4 on Duke Street and Halley's Lane. The cars are now parking right on that corner on top of the yellow line.  Now, kids at 8.30 in the morning and at 3 in the afternoon, that is an accident waiting to happen. Is there any way, A, you can widen the curb, push the curb out a little bit more so cars literally can't park there unless they drive up on top of the curb? And by the pedestrian crossing, just put a little bit of concrete curbing out to fill it in so it stops people parking in those dangerous places.",

In that town centre, a lot of money was spent to get the streets, you know, in the shape they are and the nice streetscaping and the new curbs and the way it all drains and everything like that, because there's not a huge  stormwater network that we can tap into. Often when you put islands in at the side of the road, you've got to be able to put drainage in as well and tap it into the system, otherwise you create a dam in the Kirwan Channel. But I think probably in the short term, while people  you know, get back used to driving and parking. We perhaps need to have our parking enforcement officer, particularly at those before and after school times, you know, probably do a bit of patrolling, give some warnings first and then issue some tickets.

About a month ago, contractors put a 150 mil pipeline, thrusted it from the Cambridge Primary School to the fire station.  and none of the cones and signs have been picked up. I've already requested it. As of yesterday, some of the cones have been chucked into the Cambridge Primary School pool. A lot of the signs have been taken around and they're laying in the grass or on people's property and in the front of shop entrances on Duke Street. I'm wondering if there's a situation where  Once the job is completed, the contractor must pick up those within 24 hours. On Sunday morning, a lot of the boxes with the plants in them had been pushed over outside the warehouse. And thankfully, I don't know whether there's vandals or not, they'd put some cones up to tell people that they were in the middle of the road. But yeah, that's just an issue that I think  Yeah, it's just, yeah, just crazy. The other thing, the boards that submitted for the 1st of July on the need for a roundabout at Duke Street, Akeli's end, and the reason we did that was to alleviate some of the pressure on the high level bridge and encourage people to go around there. You've done a beautiful job with the hot mix. Is there, I'm not looking for a $4 million roundabout, but is there something  in terms of concrete blocks that you could put around about in there, which facilitate that until it came around to council actually doing something permanently about it, Brian.",

I think it would still need some careful consideration, but just because of the grades, you know, and the slope of the road, roundabouts, typically when they're built, while they have that slope out from the central island to the outside, that keeps speed down as traffic travels around the roundabout because, of course, they're on this  slope outwards, but if you have a roundabout and it causes you then say coming down Duke Street Hill and turning right onto Achilles Ave, if it pushes you across the other side and you're a, you know, a truck with higher sides or a higher load or something and then you tip over,  because there's too much slope on a roundabout. So I think, you know, we would have to explore all those issues. So it would be a little bit more complex than just putting out some blocks.

So yeah, speaking to our k\u014drero report for obviously July through to September, you'll be aware that the previous k\u014drero saw the re-emergence of COVID-19 and this had big impacts on our area of business as it has with many people.  Our teams and facilities worked super well, shifting between the change in alert levels and the added challenges associated with working in levels 3 and 2. I'll briefly cover some of our key highlights that we were still able to achieve over the previous call despite those disruptions.  The first one, we managed to complete the John Hewitt Drive specimen tree planting in August. That was either side of that first lockdown period, thanks to Delta. These trees are going to provide a fantastic avenue for that popular park at Waipuki in the years to come. So we're really glad to get that across the line. As part of that, we also partnered with the Cambridge Tree Trust  who planted and mulched the majority of the triangle gardens along the driveway with native plants. And this will strengthen the ecological corridor between Maungatautere and the awa. And we're looking to partner with them again next year to finish off the triangles that weren't compared this season.  We're still getting a large amount of vandalism across our parks and public toilets. This has been really frustrating and, quite frankly, heartbreaking for both our staff and contractors working to make our open spaces beautiful, vibrant places. Some of you may have been contacted by frustrated residents in relation to some of this antisocial behaviour as well.  We do have a programme of work to improve the security of some of our hotspots, including guest light theatre and Pukemako. Some of the measures include adding security cameras, speed bumps and additional or renewed bollards and gating. Unfortunately, this programme of work has also been impacted by the COVID-19 delays and contract availability and also product supply issues.  The library teams have done a fantastic job working between the different alert levels. It seems that whenever we get an announcement by the government regarding the tightening alert levels, people flock to the libraries to stock up on books and get set for a long haul. And during the first week open at Alert Level 2 in September,  Cambridge Library issued just over 8,000 items alone and had over 4,500 items returned. So some really big numbers. I think actually that week in particular was a record ever for our libraries.  The Parks Operations team, they've worked with the Farmer's Market and the Cambridge Cricket Club to improve the turf health of Victoria Square. Ongoing management will continue with the Farmer's Market to ensure they use different areas of the square during the year to minimise or reduce the wear and tear in one particular spot.  Council, using its delegation, provided ministerial approval for the Maungat\u016bturu Reserve Management Plan. And we've also commenced our project planning, including initial discussions with Ng\u0101ui T\u014dpua Waip\u0101 for three key pieces of work that we're doing in our team, looking at concept plans for  the district cemeteries, concept plans for the lakeside reserves, and also looking into our lease model review for sports parks we currently have across the district. So despite some of the challenges of last quarter, to provide you with a bit of a brief snapshot of what our team's been up to over that time,  which is commencing just a bit of a reminder, really. We've got Cambridge on Friday from 4.30 to 6 o'clock, and then also, you know, we've got a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of  a Saturday session, and that time escaped me. But we do have the two sessions coming up this week. We actually just had our first one on Te Atumutu this evening as well, and despite a decent share of heavy rain, had a reasonably good turnout with some good discussion. So that's proving very worthwhile.  Sorry, just one other thing I'll just add. Previously, last month, we came to you regarding the limited domain mural. There's an update on that that was approved at SPMP committee this week. So we'll be looking to kick that off, or we're running out of time a bit in December now, but at least into January to get that work going ahead. So I'm happy to take any questions that anyone has on our report or the update.",

I just want to ask, recently, and we perhaps should have got onto it a bit sooner, some playground equipment was removed from a playground close to the main road in Cambridge and taken, and I gather it was reinstalled up at the Leamington Park. It was a seesaw. I've actually apparently had some information that says it's been a bit of a disappointment because  Although the council staff regarded it as not used, it was actually being used by families who had children on the autism spectrum, because it was a quiet, safe place for those children who don't like being near a crowd. And so we have, unfortunately, not thought of that. And we've now got some children in the area that were actually  able to use a playground quite safely that suited their needs. And I just wonder what we can do about that.",

So the pieces that we could relocate, we did to try and fill that gap until Leamington Domain has that full renovation, which is at this point pending the new LTP approval.  year four, current year four program. And sort of every program we're doing now, we're looking to use more sensory equipment and features that allow for different levels of disabilities and autism spectrums. So we are creating those sort of spaces. We're trying to accommodate those spaces as much as we can in our new designs.  Yeah, so really, you know, I mean, there were only a couple of pieces of equipment down at that playground, which was just enough for those children.",

I guess the main thing we probably need to do is come up with better quality signage that is going to allow the community to understand the project a little bit better and engage with the project a little bit more. Signage is expensive.  So it'd be great to be able to invest in something that's of quality. Obviously, there's a risk of those signs being removed, but we can kind of work through some creative ways to make sure that's not too much of a problem if that happens. And then also Council's very generously always donated fresh garden mix, but there's also the requirement to sort of feed the gardens with something a little bit more, whether that's  you know, pelletized manure or compost. So it'd be great to have some funds to be able to do that as well. And there's various items like steaks, the tomatoes, and that sort of thing that come up, which would be good to have something that we can draw on when that is required. There are three gardens.  sites at the moment, and it would be great to continue to grow that for a fourth garden in autumn. I think it's also worth perhaps having some conversation around at a later stage, the strategy of this project and where we want it to go as a board. But that can be perhaps discussed at the end of the meeting. But if anybody has any questions about this motion, happy to answer. OK.",
