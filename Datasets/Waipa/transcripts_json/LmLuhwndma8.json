Hey, just before I start, just a warm congratulations. I was at the Dairy Industry Awards last night.  A real warm congratulations to Edward Roskam, who's the new dairy trainee winner. He's from Matamata. Brian Bassey and Rachel Bunnock took the share manager, share farmer, sorry,  Sheer Farmer of the Year Award from Petare. But the real winner here, in my view, because he's a Waip\u0101 resident, is Andrew Mackey, who's from Ohaup\u014d, and he took out the Dairy Manager of the Year. So these are the Waikato Awards, so these winners will now go through to the National Awards Program. So, yeah, just got a bit of a shout out there for our primary industry, because, yeah, they're pretty hardworking people and, yeah, it's a pretty good life section.  Hey, back to us to this delivery meeting. So first of all, I'd like to call for apologies. I do obviously have apologies from Graham Webber, Phillip Coles, and Hazel. And I don't believe that we've got any other apologies, but should we pop one in for lateness for Bill Harris? Have we heard from him? No, Bill's here. Oh, Bill is here? Okay, I can't see him.",

So, yep, this report is through to the end of February, but the graphs are only updated to the end of January due to timeframes and collecting the data. So, of particular note, the flood hazard mapping. So, 100 letters have been sent to properties modelled and subsequently surveyed that they will be impacted from a one in 100 year rainfall event.  And there's still approximately 10 properties undergoing final technical reviews and their properties that are right on the edge of are they likely to flood or not. So we're just doing a bit more technical work to confirm them. The public flood hazard map view is now online. So people can go on and look at their property to see if it's in the flood zone or not.  We're currently working on the submissions on the proposed tomato ROI drinking water regulations and the Ministry of Environment proposals for source water protection. The Ministry of Environment source ones are covered in a later report this morning and staff are working on the tomato ROI ones and we'll be reporting to council later this month on our submission for those ones.  Physical works commenced this month on the Lake Tukutu rain gardens, the Lakeview Drive stormwater improvements, and the Shelley Street outforward placement. And the good news, it's been a long, hot, dry summer, which is still continuing. But we've managed that with no restrictions and just continued our education program. So that's a great sign of the investment we've made over the last  10 years or more in drinking water capacity.",

But I was also interested in whether or not the fact that people can use as much water as they need, that there was an increase overall of year volume consumed. And if that's going to sort of assist us, you know, with the revenue to, you know, there was always a question of,  the pricing that we set for the water, whether it was, you know, like you have the standard or the unit charge, and then you have the volumetric charge. Have you been able to do any work on that to see whether or not that's looking healthy? And the hope that by putting that investment in, that in fact, the revenue that we earn is definitely covering our costs, our extra costs.",

But then that probably helps, you know, one of the things when you do put restrictions on people then do think they've then got to use the water, because that's the only time they can do it. So sometimes it does have a negative  impact on use. So certainly we only reached trigger levels when we would normally go to level 2 and level 3 a few times. We weren't always above our previous trigger levels. So that was good. Our trigger levels had increased due to our capacity increase. But yeah, we didn't touch trigger 3 at all, I don't think, only in key a couple of times.",

    "text": "Okay, let's continue. So still on the exact same area, the New Parallel Treatment Plant was non-compliant for protozoa removal.  This was a technical compliance from incorrect programming of the new membranes, which was not identified during commissioning. The membranes are required to perform a pressure decay test daily from the drinking water standards, but that was occurring every 24 hours. So that caused us to be a technical non-compliance for last month.  Obviously that's since been rectified. It wasn't picked up during commissioning because we were doing the pressure decay tests every day as part of the commissioning. It was only once we started running it, we realized they were going every 24 hours runtime and not every calendar day. Moving on to 3.1.2 water supply bylaw. So we're currently working on reviewing the bylaw.  Although it wasn't due till next year, but we took the opportunity to work on this because it will give us better protection around backflow prevention and water source protection. So that's one of the rationale for bringing it forward. And then on to 3.1. So again, it was just touching on that point that we've not implemented any water alerts this year.  but it has not stepped us away from our education program. And following that, there's some screenshots of some of the education campaign we've been running. I'm flicking through to Section 5 Risk Management and Section 5.3. So COVID delays to specialist equipment manufacture and extended delivery times from overseas could  delay some projects. For example, the future Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant upgrade. So the procurement strategies for any of these projects are trying to address those risks so we can procure early where we can. It's also causing some issues in maintenance and repairs. Some equipment, if it needs to come from overseas or be manufactured, there's significantly long delay times. So we've certainly upped our stock of critical spares  the best we can to try and cope with that. And generally, civil contractors are presently busy with the amount of large residential development and in part the DIA funded works. So ensuring good response for our own council works, we're requiring early contractor with contracting firms to make sure that availability is there really before we go to the market. And again, making sure our procurement strategies align with that.  to enable us to talk to contractors early. Generally, we wouldn't talk to them to put the tenders out, but that's not working well. So we need to have some early engagement. And then also 5.4 cost escalations. So price increases are expected over the coming months with respect to contract renewals or new contracts in particularly for electricity supply and chemical supply. So both those contracts are due for renewal and it's expected there'll be significant increases in them.  And septage tankard waste 5.5. So the septage waste poses a significant risk to the operations of the Cambridge Wastewater Treatment Plant. To manage this risk more effectively and ensure compliance with the Wastewater and Trade Waste Bylaw, we're introducing a new tracking system. We've been working on it for quite a while and have also installed automated sampling at the septage waste receivable plant. We're hoping the new tracking system will be live  before Easter, so sometime in April, hopefully. And that will enable us to better track where the septage tanker companies are picking their waste up from and before they deliver it to us, giving them a specific pin number to allow them to dispose of it. And the next one is section 6.4, project stormwater improvements. So again,  The Lakeview Drive stormwater improvements are well underway and expected to, there'll be, it says in May in here, but they'll probably be completed early April. And that's putting in significantly more capacity in the soakage in that area. Shelley Street stormwater outlet renewal, which is the contract that Dawn spoke of earlier. So work was planned to start this month on that stormwater outlet renewal.  Unfortunately, due to delivery of items required to replace that outlet, that may be delayed depending on delivery. We want to try and do it while the weather's still good. But if the new equipment and new structure that required doesn't come in time, we may have to delay that until next summer. So we're just waiting to see what the delivery times are like.",

And you can see that we've got those four, I think, signboards, five signboards that we're going to install on site at either side of the road, one by the church and one over on the lake side of the roundabout. So to inform the community of what we're doing and why we're doing it, how a rain garden works, what a rain garden is, and all those things. It's a bit of a challenge to try and make it  simple enough to understand without going too far into the complications. Well, hopefully we've got it, we've got it right. Yep, so those, we're hoping to get those signs up early next week in those areas to start, so people can start looking and meeting and asking questions, like saying the media release is out, is due out this week as well.

Martin, I'm just in terms of the draft compliance rules and a lot of those are obviously not impacting directly on Council, but we're looking really at a supportive role, I suppose, for the  you.  I was going to say the individual suppliers, is anybody supplying more than one household, isn't it? But some of the acceptable solutions look to me to be quite expensive and quite a lot of compliance monitoring, I suppose. So have we got any contact with anyone from the likes of Federated Farmers for argument's sake? Are we going to try and make a joint submission or is this  just going from council because, you know, we're really looking to support individuals out there with supplying more than one house, obviously, but some of these, I suppose, some of our residents won't have realised what's coming down. I was going to say down the pipeline, the pun wasn't intended, but it's going to be quite costly and disruptive, I would suggest.",

When we undertake approvals for these road closures, I noticed in the past we've had a pretty regular habit of keeping those road closures available online on our website.

It wasn't available on, I couldn't find it either, on our website. And so they were having to find it, obviously, eventually through the official sites of the race holders and what have you. So I wonder if there just needs to be a closure off in terms of that, excuse me,  that process in terms of making sure that that information is readily available to our residents.

And so the Ministry for the Environment are seeking feedback on three proposed areas to improve the existing NES, and that's around standardising the way source water areas are defined, strengthening the regulation of activities around the water sources themselves, and also including more water suppliers. So our submission supports the general intent of the changes, but not in their entirety.

    "text": " Thanks, Madam Chair, and sorry to be banging on about water again. Hey, look, and I support your submission, but in a general sense, but I just wonder whether  the changes that are being promoted are actually backed up by good science. And again, not wishing to show my age, but if you take the Te Amidu catchment up on the slopes of Prongier, I can cast my mind back to when water protection areas, particularly when pretty much raw water was piped into town,  Those water catchment areas were  really heavily protected. Even our water treatment plant operators had to have regular tests to make sure they weren't carrying typhoid or any other enteric illnesses and things. But the moment we started putting intensive treatment on, we've now been able to open up those catchment areas really to anybody who wants to go in there from a recreational perspective because the treatment fixes any of those  fixes any of those problems. So, and when you look at the wider issue, we're drawing water out of the, out of Karapiro Dam for Cambridge, and that whole area is a water collection, the whole Waikato catchment provides water. So, you asked the question, are some of these rules going to actually impact on  the whole of the catchment for the likes of the Cambridge and, well, Hamilton City and everybody else along the river that actually takes water out of that catchment. So, I think the protection measures are necessary from an environmental perspective, but is it  necessary for a water supply, because we're going to have a whole host of people out there trying to enforce these standards on catchments that are huge, really, in terms of what the impact is.  whole of the Waikato catchment, Waiparin as well, is going to be covered by these proposed rule changes. So I think there's a real challenge there. And the other issue that I've got is in terms of bore waters and things like that, having a separation distance from the borehead, whether it's one, three or five metres, I think  it's pretty irrelevant as long as the boar head's protected so that the water can't get down the boar head. If it's a concrete slab around it and it's sloping away from the boar head, then it's protected. But yeah, look, I support the submission, but I just wonder whether we've got a genuine  I suppose, scientific issue here that we're trying to resolve or whether it's just somebody dreaming up more problems.",

    "text": "I think very good points, Jim, really good, solid points that were sort of very much considered in the making of the submission. I do have to remind that we have got processes in place at the moment. We do do a lot of these protections and, you know, zones and that sort of thing we have done for a lot of time. I think the main  key change for this is trying to standardise it and make it a consistent approach across the board, the whole country, and that's quite important. There are some scientific backings to a lot of it, although in our submission we've queried some of like the distances and where is the science around that to try and align a bit better, especially with like stock exclusion.  because sometimes that's a little bit inconsistent and there's going to be a bit of confusion there. But, you know, it's definitely a risk-based approach. We need to know what the risks are and be prepared and have mitigations in place. And I think that's the key outcome for the submission and the changes that they're suggesting and making sure that we as a council are aware of what would happen within the catchment and we're prepared.  for that. And one of the key changes for this, I think the real emphasis will be on consultation with key polluters, I suppose. And if something does go wrong, that they can contact us or they are aware that they should contact us if something's gone wrong so we can be prepared.  either shut off our supplies because our treatment can't cope with what's been polluted or not. So that's just sort of broadening up the conversation. But I hear your point around what they call their Source Zone 3, which is essentially for Cambridge and the Waikato, is the entire Waikato River catchment, which is enormous.  and how can we as a council manage that effectively and without a lot of cost on us as well. So yeah, one of the key changes is bringing in a lot more regulation to Waikato regional councils or regional councils in general to have like a solid one point source for a lot of that information. So it's gonna be a lot on regional councils, but I think there's definite benefit there for that from a district council perspective where we have to manage our risks.",

And essentially it's putting the onus on us to try and know who those are. And I mean, that's a big task, as I'm sure we're all aware, and trying to incorporate that into our planning. So, yeah, it's a big task. And I think there are some definite big changes coming.

But I think there is definitely going to be an onus on regional councils to identify. And I think Taumata Arawa are going to have to play a really heavy role in this.  when it comes to these small supplies and trying to map that. And mapping and GIS and making sure that information is available on a database so councils like us can access that freely, you know, relatively easily, then that's, I feel, where a lot of the cost will be and trying to make sure, like, ground truth the data, make sure that  it's actually accurate, so we can have really accurate data. I think that's gonna be where the cost lies, I think. But from a WIPAR perspective, we have got these risk plans in place. We do them regularly. It would just be a slightly different focus, but making sure we have that right information to include, I think that's where the cost will come.",

So really, we've got a recommendation here to approve it in its current form. I haven't heard any particular changes that anyone is wanting to make. Would that be fair call, everybody? Yeah, okay. So we've got a recommendation there. Can I have a mover and a seconder, please? Thank you, Mike.  And seconder? Thank you, Bruce. All in favour? All right. Carried. OK. All right. Thank you, Renee, for that. Yeah, appreciate it. OK, everybody, we're moving towards the end of our agenda. So we have our next item is actually a resolution to exclude the public.
