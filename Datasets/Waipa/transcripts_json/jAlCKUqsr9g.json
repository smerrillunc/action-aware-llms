    "text": "Yeah, thank you. Perhaps, thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to do the presentation. Dave Topman's going to do the slides, and Dave Symes is going to provide some technical advice.  So it's a trifecta. And how apt is that? Because it is about modernizing the emergency management framework in New Zealand. So Councillor Lou Brown is familiar with this matter in terms of the joint committee representative. We've just had a meeting with the joint committee to formulate a submission to this document. So we can just touch on that. I am conscious of time, so I'm gonna traverse the issues pretty quickly.  a two-hour presentation, and it's an over 50-page discussion document, so I'll synthesize it as much as I possibly can. So firstly, look, the National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, they've provided a discussion document, and I'll circulate that to you over the course of the week, requesting feedback from the regional and local emergency management sector regarding their Emergency Regulatory Framework Review. They call it the TRIFECTA program.  So it's about modernizing the emergency management framework. And then the slide up there is about the purpose and content of this presentation. So it really is twofold. It's just informing elected members and on the main elements of the NEMA's discussion document, seeking any high level feedback you may have from this presentation. And I'll just note any differences with the Waikato CDM group submission, which was covered off this morning. And the presentation will go through a high level of the content, the background, the main elements of the proposed  Emergency Management Bill and next steps. Next slide. So the background, the name is Trifecta Programme. It seeks to build a modern, inclusive, fit for purpose and enduring framework for the emergency management system so that the communities understand the risks they face and are prepared to act during and after emergencies. It involves iwi and Maori participation is recognised, enabled and valued. The emergency management system  is well coordinated, high performing and enjoys widespread trust and confidence. The impacts of emergencies on people, the economy and environment are reduced. And as noted in the slide, the program brings together three projects known as the trifecta system. So the background there is David's got it. So this is really a  about the new Emergency Management Bill to replace the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act. And this is what this request for commentary is about. But the other components of that trifecta is reviewing the National Civil Defence Emergency Management Plan 2015 and a roadmap for the National Disaster Resilience Strategy. So this slide,  There was, as advised, probably next slide, Dave, other than to say that this new Emergency Management Act is to be an update and it's not supposedly to be transformational as we see in some of other areas like waters or RMA to some extent. I just point out before we get into this slide that the issues that have been identified that have given rise to this review is  come about through shortcomings in the system, technical advisory group reports, lessons learned from recent events, such as Kaikoura earthquakes, Port Hills fires, and the engagement with sectors. As advised, it's targeted consultation. There's a short discussion document, as I've mentioned. CDM group have to, we have to comply with comments from the CDM professionals, CAG and joint committee, and that's been done. And we intend to provide feedback, ideally through the group,  But if you want to lodge separate submissions as a council, we can do that as well. The feedback, the timeframes are really tight. We got the documentation around 14 January, feedback's due 11 February. Next slide. So just highlighting the guiding principles. So this may vary a little bit to your slides that you were earlier presented. There are six guiding principles used to measure the suitability of the policy analysis and policy options. Their risk should be awareness, not management.  iwi and Maori participation, system performance and accountability, consequences, role clarity and certainty and operability. Next slide. And that's just a bit more detail around the guiding principles associated with that, as I've already mentioned. So next slide. The four main themes of the discussion document are roles and responsibilities, disproportionately impacted people, critical infrastructure, iwi and Maori participation,  Next slide. So, just getting into the detail a little bit of each of those categories. So, in terms of roles and responsibilities, probably one of the key areas for us has caused quite a bit of debate, really. Generally, there's been a concern, I think, expressed as that there's a lack of hierarchy between the individual duties of local authorities and the collective functions of the CDM groups that can result in  wide variation of approaches to emergency management that can contribute to misunderstanding of roles and responsibilities. So following today's discussion, initially, in terms of the various options that are in the discussion document, so do nothing option versus distinct local functions to a strengthened regional approach to a regional approach with local support.  The Greek were leaning on a strengthened regional approach, but there was comments made from a territorial authority level from a number of territorial authorities that we still need to maintain distinct local functions. We still need to have statutory responsibilities at a territorial authority level. We need to be able to budget. We need to know what our functions are and what we need to do to support the group.  we didn't really want to just be responding or giving effect to the decisions of the CDEM group without having some statutory recognition, which is where the group was heading in the strengthened regional approach. So the joint committee was landing on distinct local functions, so still allowing for territorial authorities to have the legislative mandates, but supporting the regional approach and moving perhaps in future to a more strengthened regional approach.  So I don't know if David Symes would want to comment a little bit on this point.",

    "text": "Yeah, I think, just quickly, if you lose that local, I guess, that local management or that distinct local functions, you're flying blind a bit. And I guess, you know, there's always going to need to be alignment if it's a straight out regional approach.  There's a couple of things that can happen. So one of them is, I guess, there's a tendency to migrate to, I guess, those areas.  that may have frequent events or on the face of it look to have high risk. And so a lot of focus around there. And then that means some of those other areas could miss out. But the risk with that is, of course, we know that mother nature doesn't always comply with that. And so you can get caught quite badly with a lack of planning or lack of resource.  across some of our areas. The other thing is, Wayne has mentioned, you're flying blind. So you don't know, you know, part of this, I guess, parts of the trifecta arrangement is that there's rules and regulations that sit  underneath it that are flexible and can change, and you don't know what those are going to be if they're coming from NEMA through the regional approach. So the flexibility is great, but very difficult to plan and budget as part of our long-term plans or annual planning. So that's probably the biggest risk is flying blind and being undercooked with some of your response should something go wrong.",

    "text": " Thanks for that, Dave. So I just want to just carry on moving through the presentation. I'll just go back one sec, Dave. So the next, the second bullet point there is about the membership of the CDM group. So ensuring the CDM group structure enables recognition and representation of the role of iwi and Maori play in emergency management without imposing appropriate obligations on iwi and Maori representatives.  So it is proposed to include statutory recognition for CDM group membership, to include iwi and Maori representatives together with local authority members. And the Waikato CDM group, we're advancing this proposal, CDM group anyway, about the inclusivity of iwi and Maori within the CDM various functions. And I'll come to touch on this a little bit more as it permeates joint committees and care. Importantly though, sorry Dave, importantly though, consultation input from kiwi, iwi authorities  and the consideration of the options and design of methods to achieve iwi and Maori participation throughout the emergency management system will be required. And I'm not sure they've actually done that at this point. The final point of the bullet point there in that slide is the standardization of legal status CDM groups. There is no legal status of CDM groups. The bill would provide some legal status relating to the CDM groups. The roles and responsibilities are clear under the act.  and their liabilities. So the groups support that approach as well. Slide, yep, so the next slide. Accessibility of CDM group plans and consistency of publication. Won't spend too much time on this. It's really just defining what documents are published with the group plan. We don't need to publish all the technical documents, having to go through formal public consultation on that. Those documents can be separately excluded, but still available to the public if they wish to  review, for example, the controller policy or the training strategies or the terms of reference of the joint committees or CAG. And the group support that in their submissions. The undeclared emergencies review the coordinator response to undeclared emergencies. So the proposal there is to provide greater guidance and clarity in the act about the management of undeclared emergencies that require coordination, but not a significant response.  There's been a few examples of recent where group controllers have been asked to wade in on matters such as the rubbish fire, the peat fire north in the Waikato area, and didn't really have a lot of authority, a lot of statutory responsibility there to actually do anything.  So the group do support a change in the act by clear response thresholds, and that's going to be the key. What are those response thresholds and the coordination of undeclared emergencies that should provide more clarity. This would introduce functions and powers for controllers that perhaps are outside of the state of emergency and liability protection for undeclared events should also be provided. It must be important that we don't undermine other legislative responsibilities or actions that we can pursue  to deal with the issue at hand. And CDM, this change shouldn't cut across that. Finally, concurrent emergencies. So the proposal is about clarity about roles and responsibilities in the event of concurrent emergencies at local, regional and national levels. They may be declared or undeclared, and the act needs to provide more specifics around the provision for the management of concurrent emergencies. There is nothing at the moment.  Group support the proposal to provide guidance and clarity around responding to concurrent emergencies. So I'm up to ambulance services. First bullet point there, prove the role and clarity and certainty for ambulance services by meaning the definition of emergency services by including ambulance services. For some reason, ambulance services are not defined as emergency services. The group support the option as it reflects the current  situation in the Waikato group and other groups where St. John, for example, do come along to our CAG meetings. The point was made at the Joint Committee meeting today that it should also incorporate for air ambulance services as it likes us, not just simply St. John. There might be some unintended consequences there about the funding of ambulance services. Would they be directly funded by Joint Committee? And can you direct, say,  order St. John to come along to a Keg meeting if they're not directly funded by government. The next point, lead agencies there. So provide clear statutory definition on how lead and support agencies are defined across the emergency management system. And the group support that approach could be done via regulations, rules, and guides. Animal welfare. Interesting, animal welfare, as emergency unfolds,  You're looking after people and property as your high priorities. Animal welfare is not covered specifically in Emergency Management Act. So the proposal here is to expressly provide for the welfare of animals in emergencies. So that not only incorporates companion animals, but incorporates farm animals as well.  So now we've made the point here, you could have large dairy herds, you could have significant horses and studs that will need to be kept in mind for any sort of major emergency. So local controllers for those rural areas, they need to have good situational awareness about what's out there, not only in relation to people, property, but now animals. And if there are issues relating to animal welfare, all these directions required for animals to be  seized for their safety, then, or rescued, then the support of the Ministry of Primary Industries will be required. The group support that, but it also sheets home to those businesses, those farms that do operate, and they do anyway, I'm sure, but in response, having response plans at various emergencies, what are they doing in relation to their stock and their animal welfare? The next one is disproportionately impacted people. Bit of a mouthful,  bit unclear about what they actually means, but essentially they want to provide mandatory engagement with disproportionately impacted communities and CDM group planning activities. So the group do support that, but want some clarity around what this means. Are they talking disabled folk or I'm just not sure. So there's a little bit of uncertainty and some clarity is required.  Next item was critical infrastructure. So there's just a change in term here. You might be familiar with the terms use lifeline utilities. So the change at the critical infrastructure reflect international practice. And they want critical infrastructure sectors and entities to be specified and gazetted by the minister. Shortens the timeframes to actually get that through.  They want to improve information sharing before, during or after emergencies from critical infrastructure providers, which happens to some extent in any event. And they want to introduce sector specific response plans for the critical infrastructure to be updated every three years and monitored annually. So the point there is,  For territorial authorities, we do have critical infrastructure, our waters, our roads, those sorts of things. We just need to make sure, and the point was hammered home today, that there just needs to be no replication of efforts. So we report to all sorts of folk in terms of our essential services. We just don't want a replication of effort if we're reporting to NZTA, for example.  And what are the penalties if you don't comply? So iwi and Maori participation. So the whole bill, a whole lot of discussion document is centered on how we improve iwi and Maori participation in CDM. And so the other parts of it is incorporating a new National Maori Emergency Management Advisory Group called MIMAG to  create iwi and M\u0101ori representation on joint committees and kegs. It is suggested that MIMAG would provide some advice about who would be represented on, say, the joint committee. The discussion document just talks about two representatives of joint committee. So you quickly understand that, you know, talking to TCDC, they have 13 iwi in there, just in their area.  So how you break that down to two representatives will be a challenge. So again, I need to discuss this with Iwi about how these new structures will work. And similarly, the representation on KEGs. I do say in the document that it'll be centrally funded for the representation on joint committees and also for KEGs, but it was a little bit less clear about that for KEGs. Right.  The next thing is just reducing the impact on iwi or Maori by identifying the needs of iwi or Maori within the CDM region, developing plans to address their needs, identifying the contributions iwi or Maori can make to managing emergency events, communicating this information to the wider CDM group, their communities and others as required, and strengthening the legislative requirements for CDM groups to collaborate with Maori and iwi partners in the development of their CDM  group plans and responding to emergencies. So just before I get next steps, there's some additional proposals I just didn't have in the slide. They include specific roles and responsibilities for iwi or Maori entities in the national CDM plan and some permanent legislative authority to reimburse iwi or Maori by government for caring for affected purposes  persons in an emergency. So they might utilise their morale, for example, as part of the welfare component and just giving some legislative authority to reimburse that back to iwi, as opposed to going through local government. So again, the group supports this proposal. They support modernising the purpose statement to incorporate the Treaty of Waitangi principles. And they also give conditional support to a new rulemaking  powers for the chief executive of NEMA to undertake. So the final slide is just next steps. So we are drafting up, and it should be short finalised the next day or two, the group submission to this discussion document. I'll circulate the group submission to all councillors  as well as the informal discussion document. And I'll work with our joint committee, our representative Lou Brown on anything he feels that we need to lodge in terms of a separate submission on behalf of WIPA that's not traversed in the group submission. And if any of the councillors do have any comments in regard to the information I'll send out, then we have next week to prepare a separate submission to lodge by the end of next week.  That's me, hopefully within half an hour.",

I just asked the words like disproportionately affected people, who they were talking about, really? Were they people in flood-prone zones or next to a volcano, or is that cultural? We've got to know these things. It's an interesting fact. The other thing I just wanted to add was the ambulance services. There's an interesting fact phrased here, is that our ambulance service is owned by St. John's, but they'll be operating and taken into the Act as such.  And as such, are we funding them or is the central government funding them? And that would also impact, of course, on Westpac Helicopter and the Mercy flights that we have for fixed aircraft.

    "text": "Thank you, nice to be back. I'm conscious of time, so we'll try and see what we can do around sharing the screen first.  Where is it? There we go. OK, is this going to work? Let's hope this works. You've all seen the presentation anyway, because this was sent out in advance. So if this doesn't go to full screen, you know what? There we go. It eventually works. OK, so this is an opportunity to roll our sleeves up and  some good discussion around the environment strategy, refining the visions, principles and trying to make some headway on themes for structuring the document. So when we say about redeveloping the vision, we're probably talking more about refining it. What we actually have here in this workshop is your opportunity  using the input from partners and stakeholders that we've received so far to then have your say. It is a council strategy, not a staff one, of course. So this is an opportunity for you to contribute to its form and its direction. Also looking to redevelop principles.  but actually being conscious of the time and the fact that we're behind schedule a little this afternoon, I'd rather park those to begin with and come to the question of how we incorporate climate action in this strategy and also how we then structure the strategy, because that's going to be useful  extraordinarily useful in starting to put this together in terms of working out objectives, goals, and things like that. So if you don't mind, I'd rather kick off on those two. And then if we've got time, come back and refine the vision and principles, because I really do need to move this forward with the structure of the document. Are we okay with that, councillors? Yeah, sounds good.  Okay, so if you just bear with me as I whiz through the slides. Okay, didn't take much whizzing, that's good. So obviously these days, climate is one of the big issues in the environment, one of the big issues that council has to consider these days. So how are we going to incorporate this, if indeed we're going to,  in an environment strategy. So some options that I've put forward so far are on the screen. There may be others that you've thought of. So do we have our own separate climate action policy that can go out to the community and say, this is our position on dealing with climate issues? We could actually  instead of going out for something separate, put that within the strategy itself. We could do that. Or we develop a separate strategy. It's another work stream that would need to be resourced. Or we put climate action, and I say action, it could be however we want to phrase that. And I've got some options at the bottom of the screen there.  Do we have that as one of the themes of the strategy? Or the fourth one is it's in everything, so spread it throughout everything else in the strategy. Now, in the November partner and stakeholder workshop that we held, it was interesting because we had a bit of an online poll, as you probably know from the information that was sent out.  that was just for a bit of fun, really, a bit of curiosity. But it was interesting how Tangata Fenwa opted for option three on that list. And everyone else seemed to opt for option four. So there was very different perspectives on the question of option three or option four there, which was curious. Another option is to take  all the climate action stuff that's in the implementation plan or will be in the implementation plan and just pull that out or copy it into an appendix or something that we can say to people, this is what we're doing for climate action. Option six is we don't call it an environment strategy at all. It's a climate something strategy. Although there may be other options that  you might have and I haven't thought of, which is quite possible. So I'm really interested in your feedback on your direction as to just how we play this one, please.",

Some people thought it was important to separate  climate action out, and others just were happy with it to stay in. But I'm of the personal opinion it needs to be separated out, but how it's communicated, I don't know. Like I understand some other councils, with every report that's brought to any committee of council, there's a section climate impact. So it's actually the,  the impact of decision-making by council is you have a strand there that's gonna be considering any impact on the climate with that. But I'm also aware that the regional council are gonna be publishing a roadmap shortly or an action plan for reducing emissions and also climate adaptation.  And I wondered whether or not we could sort of piggyback on that, because that'll be done at a regional level, but then we could, you know, do it at a district level or pick up, yeah. Yeah, yeah. But my gut feel is that we should be having it separate and that we should be reporting not only on our own actions, the council ones, but also a community level, yeah, what our aims are there.",

And the feeling was that if we focus on it individually, it just gives us another point on the agenda where we're actually replicating what we're doing initially.  I think when we're dealing with the environment, we're dealing with something, as we talk of climate change, that we are not able to quantify exactly. So we're going to have to work with this as something that is going to develop over time, and we will need to have this ability to be able to create strategies as we go along, and consider it, like we do with the resource management and all the rest, as an important part of our decision-making processes. But to bring it out as a separate subject,  would make it just a little bit too complex and make it a difficult thing. We'd probably be reiterating the same arguments.",

Because I agree, climate change comes and goes, and it's here at the moment, whatever it's caused by, but it still has to be affordable.  And so, you know, for our ratepayers, so we might want to do some things that we actually can't afford to do, and we just have to live with it. So if it is diffused through, I mean, I'm just thinking of school here, when things are diffused through, there's advantages and disadvantages to either of them. The one above action three, it's probably more of an intense focus.  rather than the few through. So I'm easy which way it goes here, but the overriding thing for me is, when it comes out of here, there's going to be some calls that we want to make that I think we're not going to be able to, because it's simply not affordable. And I do pick up on, it is the latest fad, this climate change thing.  And I'm not saying it's not real, because of course it is, but it's still a bit of, you can't afford to do what, you can't beat nature at the end of the day, in terms of some of these things we might want to do.

We need some themes to hang issues on or activities or services. So I'm interested in trying to develop some themes. And I sent you some papers with  some ideas that we've come up with, the feedback from the engagement we've had so far, plus some ideas and our own look around the globe, trying to find some equivalent type of strategies that we like the look of and could actually understand, because obviously there's a lot of documents out there in other languages. But we need a structure that  going to be easy to navigate, excuse me, not just for staff and yourselves, but also for the community. We obviously want to incorporate everything, need to be flexible enough to amend because obviously over the lifetime of this strategy, issues can come and go. So we need to think ahead as well. And it'd be nice if it's interesting, because we want people to read this,  and see what we're going to do. And obviously we need to deliver the vision and community outcomes. So I've, let's say I put that document out for you to consider. I've also done some thinking since. What I'm keen to try to avoid this afternoon is me just putting up some ideas and you saying whether you like it or not.  We've done that before, but we really want to have your input into more than just saying, yeah, I like it or I don't like it. So has anyone got any ideas as to how we try and structure this into some themes? I'll try and see if I can find one of my documents.

So it's not just about environment.

But the six that they are promoting are healthy lives and wellbeing, being protecting and restoring native biodiversity and land use,  and then making cities or human settlements sustainable and inclusive, and then promoting peaceful and inclusive society. So that would be looking at the collaboration, I guess, within WIPA and making sure, you know, promoting that kind of sharing of information and best practice, and then focusing on particular climate action that's really urgent, for instance,  reducing emissions, waste reduction or recycling, clean energy. And then lastly, strengthening the means of implementation. And that's sort of looking at wider partnerships and I suppose business involvement and things.  One of them was civic involvement and that sort of groundswell of involvement. And then this level, I imagine, is other agencies and linking with them, stronger collaboration and outcomes.

Now, some of those sub-themes are actually council services anyway, transportation, for example, parks and green space, another. And it just seemed to split into four themes. So the managing Wi-Fi is all about what we do as council, as an organisation. It's our internal resource use,  It's all about our buildings, our water, our energy, staff travel, all of that, our investment and procurement policies, our partnerships, our participation. It can be about our governance, our report writing and all of that kind of stuff. Living WIPA is all about communities and sustainability, keeping the water  separate, so if it needs to be taken out one day, it can be taken out one day. Food security, something that might be coming on the horizon at some point, so that just shows that we can slot things in. Not ignoring growth, development, land use planning, but also more efficient  more energy efficient buildings. Also, not forgetting the economic side of this business. And of course, all our green space type of stuff as well. Each of those would, each of those colored themes would have a goal as I see it. And under each of those sub themes, parks and green space, for example, a number of environmental objectives.  How does that grab you? And climate obviously then is diffused through all of them, but we could add a fifth one in if you felt that we needed climate to stand alone.",

    "text": "If it does get stuck, don't worry. OK, no, that's cool. OK, so, yeah, as I say, another touchpoint on the annual plan, part of our continuing engagement with you as elected members on what is an important accountability document, the annual plan.  This is an open session, so important we remember that. And the reason we've gone open is we think this is now the right time to give our community some insight into where the budget numbers and the level of rates increase are landing, and also an insight into the proposed engagement process. That's pretty important. So you can see the other topics that we're looking to cover this afternoon.  All right. OK, so key actions to date on the annual plan. So, look, we did confirm the approach with you as elected members in the latter part of last year, and in particular, we discussed that we thought we would be in a situation with the annual plan  where it wasn't really going to depart from the LTP, or I suppose the reverse way of saying that is where we believed it would be quite consistent with the LTP. And with that being the case, then there was no need to formally consult with our community under the special consultative procedure.  And, yeah, in saying that, I think it's important to note that the legislation, the Local Government Act expressly provides for that as an option, the engagement rather than special consultative procedure. And the reason it does that is that makes good sense, because what that does is support the importance of the long term plan in determining council's direction.  Council's objectives and the finances over a multi-period of time rather than just individual years. So, in that scenario, an annual plan would essentially just be a confirmation of the next one year slice of the previously consulted on and agreed long-term plan.  Okay, so that's very much the approach that we shared with you prior to Christmas and the approach that we're still proposing this afternoon as we talk to you. Okay, yeah, key forecasting assumptions. Look, there's a bunch of stuff that is happening in the economy at the moment.  Obviously, if you're keeping up with the Herald or stuff or whatever, you're seeing all sorts of things coming through on a daily basis in the interest rate space and the inflation space, etc. So what we obviously need to do, and in fact what we have been doing, is keeping up with expert advice in that whole economic domain.  in terms of interest rates, in terms of inflation, in terms of economic environment assumptions. And as you're aware, we very much keep close the likes of Brad Olsen at Infometrics, Earl White at Bancorp, and also Burl in the inflation space.  Yeah, we've reviewed over the last few months, staff have reviewed our budgets and we've reviewed our development contributions and we've reviewed our fees and charges. And we're now at the point where we've pretty much shaped up a first draft of the annual plan.  So, yeah, a draft first cut annual plan. And the other key thing that we've done, because we are required to do this, is to review our annual plan, our draft annual plan against our significance and engagement policy to ensure that there's nothing there that's going to force us to have a departure from what I proposed earlier on and spoke about earlier on.  in terms of that annual plan, you know, not having to go through a special consultative procedure. So, yeah, so look, we've made that assessment. We still think we're in the right space, that we can go down the engagement path rather than the special consultative procedure path. Okay, are we all good with that so far?  Okay, right, so into the numbers, I guess. So yeah, so this is the rating impact numbers, very much in the form that we usually share them with you. The first column of percentages is what we had in year two of the long-term plan. So those are the numbers that we set in concrete when we adopted that annual plan a few months back.  The right-hand column is how the annual plan is falling at the moment in regard to the current draft. Important that we recognise that the figures that you're seeing right here, right now, are draft. They are still subject.  to a little bit of change, and really, I guess, if there was to be any change, where that change would potentially come from is a final financial review, I guess a bit of a QA process that the finance team is running right now and over the next week or two. The numbers obviously have all been compiled,  Obviously, due care has been taken in compiling those numbers, but just running a bit of a QA process just to make sure that they are totally, totally fine. Okay, so just that slight health warning on those figures on the right-hand side of the page.  Okay, things to note on the page in front of you. So, yeah, so the, I guess the one, two, the third line down, the net rates line. Okay, you can see the 4.4% and the 4.3%. So that's our headline number in regard to average rates increase. And you can see that it's pretty much similar to what it was in the LTP. It's a very, very small 0.1% reduction.  on what we had in the LTP, so very much in the same territory. The interesting part of this table in front of you, I guess, is the bottom line there, which is the rates limit, okay, and you will recall that that is LGCI plus 2%.  So that's what our policy says that we need to live within in regard to a rates limit. So it's a self-imposed rates limit, but it is very, very clearly set by our financial strategy that we adopted in line with the long-term plan.  that rates limit. And you can see that for year two of the LTP, we were at 4.9% because, you know, because the bills estimate at the time of what LGCI, the Local Government Cost Index for the 22, 23 year is, that there was 2.9% plus the 2% margin that we put on top of it, that was 4.9%.  In their October forecast for the very same year, BUILD has actually reviewed that and they've landed in an LGCI of 2.4% with the 2% on top. So you can see a fairly significant reduction in that control number and that target number.  which to be fair is a little bit surprising in the current environment that we're in. You've probably noticed of recent days that the CPI, the Consumer Price Index, which affects consumer goods, et cetera, that's actually hit a 30-year high at the end of the December 21 quarter, so 5.9% for the year ended 31 December 2001.  So it's almost like we're in a, you know, basically in an economic situation where we've got unprecedented levels of inflation, and yet, you know, the Birl numbers appear to be going in slightly the opposite direction. That CPI thing is a backwards looking thing, obviously, the Birl thing is a forward  forward-looking things, so we do have that change. And of course, the thing that is being measured is significantly different as well in terms of one of them being consumer price inflation, the other one being local government-type costs, which are largely focused on things like salaries and the price of bitumen and that sort of stuff. But it is a little bit of an anomaly there, but that's what we've got.  this stage, that is the most up-to-date bill number and that was cast as of October of last year, so fairly recent, you know, within the last three months as part of a national exercise that Taito Ara  organised for local government. They're the ones who contract BIRL to provide that number. We checked in with them in the last week or so to say, hey, given what's happening in the CPI world, as if we're doing a review of that number, they've sort of said,  at this stage they're not proposing that. That's a fairly significant exercise and a fairly costly exercise. So at this stage, the best and most timely information we've got is at 4.4%. What that means, of course, is that we have a very, very small buffer between where our average rates are falling at the moment, 4.3%, and where that upper limit is sitting, 4.4%.  So I guess even a $50,000 or $60,000 increase in costs within the organisation, which is a pretty small number obviously, would potentially jeopardise us remaining within that threshold.  So, yes, things are tight. We always see it, even during the formulation of the LTP, that year two was the tight year. And, yeah, I guess that's just slightly more, well, actually considerably more exaggerated in the figures that are on the page in front of you. So, Madam Chair, I just wonder, with me having said all that, if there were any comments on where those headline numbers are sitting.",

So look, as I said before, we've kept in tight contact with a number of advisors in that space, and at the same time as we were getting the burl inflation numbers through October last year, we were also getting interest rate forecasts or reprojections from Earl White of Bancorp.  So we have incorporated the interest rate predictions as they were in October of last year as well. So again, relatively up to date, up to three months ago. And in fact, actually with that one, with the interest rates, we will, because that interest rate forecast information is a whole lot easier to obtain than the inflation stuff,  We will do another retweak of these numbers, not before our March meeting, at the start of the engagement process, but certainly before we adopt this fully at the end of June. We'll make sure that, again, we've got the latest and greatest interest rate information in there.  Actually, in a few slides time, I will be talking a little bit more about interest rates and what the impact is.

Although I do note in that, and we will come to this in a few slides' time, that that's probably not going to be so much of an issue for the 2022-23 year that we're talking about. I suspect that's probably going to be more of an issue in the next two to four years than it is for the next year, just the way those interest rate projections are falling at the moment.

I think just to you, Ken, I'm quite in agreement with what you're doing, but we also, I think, have to consider the fact that there'll be a slowing in the economy, quite appreciable, I think.  And that will impact on collection of rates, and that will also probably affect on development contributions. And I think that whole thing is going to jig down over the next six to 12 months quite substantially. There's strong talk of people finding economic pressure, reduction in the housing market. You're reading all of this, and this is coming from the Reserve Bank. So he's saying that there is going to be some big corrections  And they will come about. So what I'm looking at is our cash flow is based on sort of a 90% collection rate. Will we see people deferring rates or doing that? Is that considered at all? And a lowering of our DC collection?",

But look, that's the sort of stuff that we are reviewing monthly. I mean, you see those things coming through in the standard reports that you're getting to Council.

Yeah, so look, if things do change quite markedly on the economic front, we need to have that ability to push stuff out to those later years.

    "text": " All right, okay, so Madam Chair, I suggest we carry on to the next slide. We can certainly come back to questions later if we have to. Okay, so yeah, so look, I've sort of set out that last page was obviously the headline number that's all based on total rates revenue. But I guess the thing that we need to be very conscious of is the underlying elements of that total rates revenue.  So, yeah, so just pointing out a couple of things on this slide to be aware of, because you will see these things actually coming through in the graphs on the following pages. So, yeah, so look, yeah, so the main changes, I guess, in terms of the individual rates forming the main figure are in the wastewater space and the urban stormwater space, and you can see those on the screen in front of you.  It's the urban ratepayers who will see the major impact of these things, because of course it's only the urban ratepayers who are getting the wastewater rates. They're the ones that are being serviced by our sewage.  sewage systems. So they're the ones who get the wastewater rates, the rural community doesn't. And of course, urban stormwater by definition is also only on urban properties. So yeah, so look, you can see a couple of things here. By far, the more dominant of these two is the wastewater. So you can see that while the LTP picked for year two that our wastewater  wastewater charges would have to be 704.80. They've actually ended up having to be at 737, mainly to basically incorporate increased depreciation. The urban stormwater is actually going the opposite direction,  But like I say, the numbers are much higher in that wastewater space. So, yeah, so we will see, yeah, we will see urban ratepayers, you know, having a higher increase than expected as a result of that in regard to the general rate, which applies to everyone.  Yeah, that's actually landing at the moment slightly lower than what we would, than what we would expect, or what we did expect when we adopted the long-term plan. Okay, so you're seeing a little bit of a change of incidence when you look at that headline number with urban getting a bit of a lift, and actually our rural properties actually reducing a bit with the benefit of that general rate coming down.  and you will definitely see that coming through in the graphs in the next few pages. OK, so I'll, in fact, go to those graphs. OK, so this is the impact of rates across the entire district.  Now, what we're looking at here is, so the blue bars or the blue columns, I suppose, is the format that they're in, is what we were expecting or what we had built into year two of the long term plan. The green is how these numbers are falling in the draft annual plan that we've got at the moment.  Okay, so 4.3% is our headline average rates increase, but that is only an average with significant spread around that average. And in fact, really, really interestingly, actually, can you see my cursor circling around on the screen? Not sure if you can or not.  Yep, we can. Oh, you can see that? Yep. Okay, so this is unlike a normal bowel curve, which might see your average sort of being the highest columns. Our average is actually some of our lowest columns. So, in fact, there are very, very few ratepayers who will be getting an increase between 3% and 5%. These columns are quite short.  and effectively what we are seeing, so we're seeing largely rural ratepayers who are, you know, who are sitting in this, you know, one to two percent category, and even more predominantly in the two to three percent category, or banding I suppose,  OK, so rural ratepayers paying between 1 and 3 percent more for their rates, or we're getting rates increases of that magnitude. And then we are seeing our urban ratepayers on the other side of the average sitting between 5 and 8 percent. OK, these are quite arbitrary bandings, but my point is that although we've got an average of 4.3 percent,  Yeah, not many ratepayers are going to end up with it. The rural ratepayers will have increases lower and the urban ratepayers, in general speak, will have increases that are higher. I think that's a very important point to remember.  Approximately 50% of properties will have an increase greater than the 4.3% average. Yeah, so that's where we're landing at the moment. Yeah, but that was quite consistent, obviously, with the LTP, where we actually had 60% of properties higher than the average of 4.4% as it was in the LTP. Okay, so that's the profile for the district.  Just moving on to the various areas. So just looking here at Cambridge properties. So obviously the Cambridge Ward is largely urban. There are some lifestyle and some rural properties in the mix.  but largely urban, so you can see the great majority are sitting between the 5% and the 8%. And you can see that what has actually happened here is, so while generally for year two of the LTP,  You know, the vast majority of Cambridge ratepayers were sitting in the 5% to 6% banding, that's the blue column. Yeah, a big chunk of them have actually moved out of that banding over to the right, just been pushed up into the next banding predominantly by that wastewater charge being higher than was expected in the LTP.  OK, so still very much in that 5% to 8% range, but a few of them jumping over into the next expanding. Those lifestyle and rural properties that are within the Cambridge Ward boundaries are obviously sitting much more at this end. And in fact, you can see a shift really, that blue column at the back there, and the 2% to 3% is actually higher than it is now because some of those have shifted across to the 1% to 2%.  Obviously, the same sort of drive is there in terms of the wastewater charge, but\u2014and again, largely in urban ward. But, yeah, the green column and blue column are very, very similar in this regard. This is why it's a bit different from Cambridge.  Te Amutu properties were actually at a higher banding. While a lot of the Cambridge properties were in five to six percent and have now basically flipped over into the six to eight percent, the Te Amutu properties were actually in the LTP already in that six to eight percent banding and have largely remained there. A very small number have actually flipped just beyond the eight percent,  but the large majority are still in the same banding that they were in previously.  Moving more to our rural wards, so, yeah, so Pirongia, actually Pirongia being a bit of a mix of the urban and rural, but not having that wastewater charge. So, yeah, you can see actually a lot of them are still very much staying in the same banding, so the green and the blue columns, which is the dominant banding.  are still pretty much staying there. In fact, if anything, you're seeing a movement to the left to lower rates increases for the Pirongi Award, and that's really getting the benefit of the reduction in the general rate compared to what it was in the LTP.  and, of course, not having the increase from the wastewater charges. So, yeah, that profile quite consistent with what we'd expect. Kakapuku, even more so. So, Kakapuku, they're pretty much totally a rural ward, obviously. So, you're seeing the blue column here, as it was in the LTP.  You're seeing a big chunk of the green move over to the 1.2 percent banding, again, getting the benefit of the reduced general rate and not obviously having the impact of the waste water. And Maungatautri, obviously the same thing, again, a largely rural ward.  Again, you're seeing, yeah, a chunk of rate powers moving over to a lower banding, 1% to 2%. Okay, so those are the rates profiles. So any questions on those? I've just got one. Sorry, Ken. When are we going to start using the new wards for our demo properties and stuff like that?",

Obviously, for electoral purposes, we're merging a couple of them up, but, yeah, but not looking to merge them on the rating front.  Okay, we'll keep moving on because it is getting recently late in the afternoon. So capital expenditure, obviously we need to keep a fairly close eye on capital expenditure.  And yeah, I guess what you're seeing there is you are seeing some timing changes in the CapEx profile. So whereas the LTP said we'd be spending $184 million on CapEx in the current year, we've now pushed some of that out, and that's down to $164 million.  And then in the annual plan year, while we had in the LTP 123 million, so quite a substantially reduced capital program, that has bounced back up really as a result of that movement and timing of capital expenditure. The vast majority of that movement being very much in the growth space.  which obviously is always dependent on developer timing. And yeah, not too surprising that there is some movement in the profile there. Okay, so, yeah, so you say.",

But look, I guess we have demonstrated over the last two or three years the ability  to manage pretty extraordinary capital expenditure programs. We obviously geared up for that a few years ago in terms of creating a project delivery team that would actually be able to get us through  a capital program of that nature. That team has done a stunning job even over the last two or three years in terms of managing sizeable programs. The other thing I would also say is I am absolutely sure that we will not be, even though our best projection is that there will be $179 billion of capital expenditure,  Look, it wouldn't surprise me in the least if some of that pushes out into future years. We've already done a bit of that in the forecast, so when we've done the re-forecasting, some of it has actually pushed out already beyond the 2022-23 year.  wouldn't surprise me if a wee bit more does. Like I say, a big part of this programme is growth related. Councillor Liu mentioned a few minutes ago, earlier on in this presentation, that potentially that might slow down with the general economic variables.  So, yeah, so things are still subject to change, but at this stage, you know, staff are in the space where, if needed, that would be achievable.",

    "text": " Okay, and the big thing about CapEx is that's the big driver of our debt levels, and no surprise there that when we are talking about some of that growth-related stuff being pushed out, no surprise that we are therefore saying that at 30 June 2022,  Whereas the LTP said that we would have debt of $243 million with that push out of the program. No surprise that that's considerably lower at $184 million being the current forecast. But what we are looking at at the moment, based on information that we've got, is pretty much the $280 million that we were saying debt would be at 30 June 2023.  I think I've got my year right. Yes, I have. 3rd of June 2023, the end of the annual plan year. We're saying that if things go to forecast in that capital expenditure space, we'll be at a similar level there. So, in other words, we'll be kind of caught up. So, you're seeing that there, obviously, on that page.  Average interest rates, so we did talk about this, there was a question about this earlier on, I think from yourself, Philip. So we did in the LTP see an average interest rate of 1.15% for year two of the LTP. Yeah, obviously things have shifted very much in that area. We're now seeing an average interest rate of 1.93%, being the latest estimates from  you know, latest estimates from Bancorp are very specific to Council's finances. So, yeah, so look, that would be quite scary. Obviously, 1.93 percent is considerably more expensive than 1.15 percent. But our saving grace really for the 2022-23 year is the fact that our opening debt levels are going to be significantly smaller.  So although we're dealing with a much higher interest rate, we're dealing with a significantly lesser value of debt that that interest rate is being applied to. So look, the interest rate impact largely absorbed for the 22-23 year,  I indicated that perhaps in regard to interest rates, the greater concern is what happens after 22-23 and the two to four years after that. Yeah, we have actually done a few numbers on that.  And, yeah, what we've said is that if our interest rates were, and again, this has nothing to do with the annual plan, like I say, this is the year after the annual plan that we're looking at at the moment. Yeah, but we've, yeah, we've done some workings, and if our interest rates were to be 1% higher than they were projected for for 23-24, and look, I think there's obviously a very great chance of that, given the differences that you're seeing here for 22-23,  and where the forecasts are taking us, that would be an extra 400, and if our debt levels were the same, you know, 280 million, we'd be looking at an extra $415,000 of interest expense, and that would be about 56% of the $415,000 would be on the DC funded loans.  which would leave obviously 44% of it to be on rates funded loans, so an impact on rates of $180,000 in the 23-24 year if the opening debt levels are at $280 million and the interest rate is 1% higher.  So, look, unfortunate if we would have to absorb that $180,000 and, of course, unfortunate if development contributions would have to absorb their share of that increased interest expense. But, yeah, I think numbers that potentially can be worked with if that's where we end up.  Okay, so that's debt levels. So yeah, so any questions on debt levels? We did talk about quite a bit about interest rates earlier on.  OK, I will keep on moving. So development contributions. So, yes, I guess this is that this is sort of running alongside, you know, alongside the annual plan. But yeah, but I guess important to the annual plan discussion because the numbers are certainly incorporated in the annual plan.  So, for the 2022-23 year, we are seeing a slight increase in the overall amount of development contributions coming in. So, $26.5 million versus the $25.5 million. Like I say, a small increase. Again, these are numbers, and in fact, the detailed development contribution numbers you see in a moment are  are draft and they are subject to change. Yeah, we have done quite a bit of review work in this space, just in the last, literally the last month or so, or certainly since we talked to you in early December.  And look, we have reviewed things like the numbers of household equivalent units that we're expecting. So a drop in the number of C1 and C3 household equivalent units, an increase in the T1 and T2.  household equivalent units, pretty much just re-forecasting on the basis of what we're seeing as the current timing of development. Yeah, we've done some tweaks in regard to the growth percentages. So, yeah, so how much of  how much of the capital expenditure relates to growth and therefore should be sheeted back to DCs, how much of it should be met by rates, and by way of example that the growth percentage for Bond Road has reduced quite significantly from 67% to 19%.  So, yeah, so we've incorporated some changes like that into the review, some catchment allocation changes for H\u0101ut\u0101p\u016b and C10, an additional capital project in C10 of $7.9 million, which is 100% growth-related, and of course, those interest rate changes that we talked about earlier on,  We have updated the interest rates that are applicable to the DC model, which is actually an average interest rate over 10%, so these numbers look a little bit different to the ones that we were talking about before, which is just our annual rates funded stuff. But you can see a reasonably significant increase in the interest rates applying to those DC loans. All of these things have been factored into adjusted  DC rates, which I will show you now in terms of the impact of that. So what this table is showing is essentially the incremental change between where DCs are landing right now after review of the model and the various rates,  compared to what they were for year two of the long-term plan. So where it's red, that's actually an increase in the amount of DC rate.  where it is blue, there have been reductions in DC rates. So you can see quite a mix there. Yeah, things like lightning costs have had a significant impact in regard to some of these increases shown in red.  Lend-to-lend costs have significantly driven those, as well as things like interest rates, etc. So quite a few changes in that space, and coming through to the actual DC charges for each of our catchment areas.  you can see those in this table here in terms of where they're landing in regard to the actual individual HEU DC charge.",

But engagement approach, as I mentioned at the start of the presentation, we've talked to you about this a couple of times in the letter.  the latter part of last year, but yeah, we're essentially in a position with, from what we're seeing right now, you know, that we're closely aligned to enough to get to the LTP, you know, regarding rates increases, etc., and the incidence of those  that we can use an engagement process rather than a formal SCP consultation process. There are differences, of course, in regard to capital expenditure. There were some reasonably significant numbers there, but those are timing issues that could potentially correct within a year or two of that.  So, yeah, so look, we are very much in that space. We've reviewed where we're at against the sense of expenditure policy, and we believe we're in a situation where we can rely quite properly on an engagement process rather than a consultation process.

So we've taken an opportunity to align with other engagement processes, which will include, so as well as the annual plan, looking at like the economic wellbeing strategy, environment strategy, Waip\u0101 community spatial plan,  and many other facets of council and bringing them all together in a mixed engagement model which will create a warm and welcoming approach for our ratepayers to come and speak to elected members and  and learn more about each of these processes all while understanding the value for their money all under the one roof. Making it really family friendly, really approachable and hopefully even getting more people than what we or a different audience sometimes what we normally would. So we've also got a specific targeted stakeholder engagement on development contributions on the 14th of February. Ken, do you want to move to the next slide after that one?  So we, thank you, we have some popular approaches from the past like making sense of council dollars and some other graphics that we're looking at updating that's just underway at the moment which we will send through to elected members in draft format to have a look at. And so these give  a nice visual representation as well around how associated rates are used and just make it really clear about that value for money and how much people really do get for their rates. So the mixed engagement idea is obviously very dependent on COVID at the moment as well. So we're just currently pulling all those ideas together at the moment and starting to work with all the different departments within Council.  So one part of that will be planning sort of our backup ideas around what happens COVID dependent. And then add to this with social media awareness and FAQs and blogs on the website and obviously media releases once this goes from draft to finalised as well.",

Part of the mix engagement idea is that we not only just go to Te Awamutu and Cambridge, but also we look at going out to some of those more rural regions as well, sort of heading out to a community hall and bringing  council to the rural reaches. So that is part of what we're looking at doing. As I said, unfortunately, it is COVID dependent, as is many things these days. But yeah, trying to crack into or make sure we get out there and get that different audience perspective rather than those that would maybe come into the chambers in a more formal process as well.",

Contrast that with the urban dwellers, where they're connected to all of those services, which they pay for.  they can see a relatively good nexus between the rates they pay and the services they get, but the rural communities are indeed something different.",

It doesn't look like anybody has any questions on that.  Good, I'll keep moving. So, yeah, so look, fees and charges, just, I guess, a little bit like the DC thing. Yeah, just, yeah, I guess a process that happens alongside the annual plan. But again, the numbers are reflected in it. So, yeah, so look, to keep an alignment with our long term plan,  We are applying, I guess, an across-the-board type inflationary increase to all of our fees and charges. So, yeah, we'll definitely be seeing that coming through. Some of those inflationary increases are recommended for fees that are charged under a buy more.  We are required under section 150 of the Local Government Act 2002 to consult on any fee increases in those areas. And what we have decided for this year, actually our traditional approach actually is to split it out and do a couple of schedules of fees and charges, one that are required to go through a consultation process  another that aren't. But we've decided this year, look, let's simplify that process because there are a number that do need to be consulted on. Let's run a consultation process for all of the fees and charges.  So like I say, that's our intention, that's what we're doing. So you will see a consultation process coming through in that fees and charges area. But like I say, just essentially untied.  tied to inflation. We have just noted here, you can see the second bullet point down, traffic management plans. Yeah, so look, at the moment, yeah, we don't charge for traffic management plans where it is a charity event. And that's quite clear in our fees and charges document at the moment. However, there's a feeling that we need to change that.  because, yeah, there's a number of events that, although charity events, because they're not profit-driven, yeah, you know, are events that do collect fees from participants, etc. So, yeah, so look, I'm looking to make a change in that space so that there are traffic management planned costs.  you know, recovered by fees and those areas. So, yes, that is a change, I guess, of philosophy more than anything else in that space to, in staff's view, appropriately recover costs.  The other mention that's made there is Cambridge Town Hall. We are expecting the charges for the hire of the Cambridge Town Hall to drop out of our fees and charges schedule because we are expecting by 1st of July 2022 for our new trust, the Cambridge Town Hall Community Trust,  to be actually running the Cambridgetown Hall, and therefore responsible in their own right for setting their fees of charges, just like Go Waip\u0101 set the fees of charges for the swimming pools and the event centre. So just noting that as well. OK, so\u2014 I'll just interrupt there for a minute.",

Obviously, that will come through the Strategic Policy and Planning Committee. So, yeah, so that, yeah, so watch the space, I guess, in regard to the fees and charges changes coming through.  Okay, so into the final slide. So look, just the, I guess, the timetable from here. So 14th of February, Valentine's Day, reminder there. So look, we've got a targeted stakeholder engagement on development contributions. So that will be obviously with the development community.  So, yeah, so, yeah, so, yeah, so some very specific engagement with that community. About the same time, about mid-February, we hope to have fully shaped up the draft annual plan document.  and some engagement collateral, and we will share that with elected members for some early review and feedback. The 1st of March, the draft annual plan document comes through quite formally to SPP for approval to engage with the community. So just like if we were running an SCP, it would be SPP that would sign that off for consultation.  In this case, we're looking for you to sign it off for further engagement. And on that same date, we're expecting to bring you the draft schedule of fees and charges as well, in this case, to approve for consultation. OK, so that's where we're immediately headed. And then, of course, thereafter, obviously, we'll hear that feedback from the community.  and we'll be on a timeframe to bring you a document for approval by 30th of June, which is the date the annual plan is required to be adopted by.

We've had three meetings already. Then we'll go into draft. I'll skip that slide, because if you want to study that, it's in the pack that was sent to you for the workshop.  Engagement. We've assessed the project against the significance and engagement policy. And the review suggests that an engagement with partner stakeholders, elected members, including community board members, rather than a formal SCP public consultation process is warranted.  We will review this again should the significance and engagement policy change in the near future. And we are looking forward to participating in the public engagement alongside other strategies in March that Ken's just been talking about. We've seen some emerging themes come from the  workshops to date around wellbeing, education, partnerships, relationships, employment, agriculture. So with your indulgence, I will just briefly talk about a couple of those, and then I'll have one more slide to finish off. So many economic strategies are now taking a wellbeing focus, generally means a shift in emphasis from  measuring production only to value-add growth outcomes. And this approach naturally aligns with Iwi values and Iwi community economic development plans, which generally are considered long-term holistic community wellbeing plans. We'll also be choosing some indicators to reflect the strategy.  So a couple of the comments so far with wellbeing from the groups that we've talked to, the importance of WIPO lifestyle was highlighted and stakeholder feedback. Stakeholders put importance not just on economic growth, but the right kind of growth, the chance to build back better, a focus on youth and education employment that also delivers  overall community well-being. So not only does it upskill and increase our labour pool, but it includes quality of life, personal satisfaction and community connectivity and so on. And this is especially true for minority groups, Maori, Pacific Island youth, who are impacted economically, socially by COVID.  Susan, I'm not sure how much time you want me to take on this.
