Thank you for reconvening because you'll recall we adjourned our meeting from the 23rd last Tuesday, where we didn't deal with the resolutions because we recognised at that stage that there were changes further to be made and in effect Ken and Leon requested  that we adjourn the meeting so those changes could be made. And we're very appreciative of the hard yards that have gone on since then. And our intent was to re-adjourn or to reconvene today. Now, what that has meant, of course, obviously, is that we have a new annual report, a new summary report  and important, we have a new memorandum and some adjusted resolutions that we are being asked to receive as a major late item. So that's what we'll go through with the care of both Ken and  But look, before I do, and I realise my form is poor, do we have any apologies to receive for this meeting? We look like we've got a full crowd, don't we? But I haven't received any apologies. We've got a full muster? It's a dumb question asking those that are mustered, but as far as I know, we're all here, so that's superb. Okay, so there's no apologies. Are there any matters of interests that members might have with this item?  Thank you, I don't presume that there is. So I'd like to move to a recommendation discussion, which is basically that this is a major late item was a recommendation, which I'll just read out. It's one that I proposed to put to the meeting that the Audit and Risk Committee considered the additional tabled information report, which includes an updated annual report and updated summary annual report.  And the further updated annual report 2020-21 and the further updated annual report summary 2021 at this meeting is major late items not on the agenda pursuant to section 46A, 7A of the Local Government Official Information Meetings Act and the Meetings Act 1987.  to enable the 2021 annual report to be adopted. So short as that, we want to see this as a major item. I move that. Roger, thank you. You second. I'll put a please all those in favour, please say aye. Aye. Thank you. Those against. It's carried. Thank you very much.  So that brings us then to the report. And Ken, I suspect you first before we ask Leon to speak to the various aspects of the audit, if that makes sense. I'm in your hands.",

Look, Bruce, you've introduced the item very, very well, and particularly in regard to the multiple copies of the annual report and summary annual report that are on the agenda.  And my apologies on behalf of myself and the team that this has ended up getting a little bit messy, particularly with one additional set that did come through to you this morning.  But look, essentially where we're at is on Friday afternoon we did get a clearance from Audit New Zealand on our annual report and our summary annual report document. So look, that was fantastic, obviously, to receive that. Yeah, what we discovered yesterday was that there was some very, very minor  changes that had been requested last week that we somehow missed in the process, and that explains the second sets of those documents that were circulated and part of the agenda this morning.  As Bruce has pointed out as well, you've just passed that late item resolution, but in the memo that proposed the recommendation for the consideration of the late item, there are some tweaks to the intended resolutions that will make sure that we capture all of the changes that are in front of us.  Alright, so look, I did just want to point out to you, and in fact in a moment we'll just pass on to Yolanda, but the tab that is entitled Additional Tabled Information Report, perhaps if you just go to that, because it is important that we do cover off on this.  So, look, this, I guess, principally relates to the very final changes that came about as part of the audit process. Yeah, well, actually, mainly due to the audit process, but also some changes requested by the Audit and Risk Committee members from our meeting, this meeting, when it first started last week.  So look, the finance team staff have set out all of those changes that happened and that happened to the documents. Those are all set out on the table. And what I'm just going to do now is just pass over to Yolanda just to talk through the two or three of the more major ones of those.  the ones that have really impacted the numbers, just so that the committee does have a good understanding of that. So, Yolanda, in your hands, just talk us through those biggies.",

    "text": " Good afternoon Chair, good afternoon committee members. So just high level, the majority of the changes related to the loss on disposal of the roading asset adjustments that we discussed last week, Tuesday. So one of the big changes was a 6.1 million adjustment. So what had happened is we had accounted for it in the profit and loss in the 2020-2021 financial year.  where the transaction should have been recognised against the revaluation surplus because those assets had been revalued in previous years. So that was one of the big adjustments. And then the prior period error note had also changed based on recommendations received from audit. And then the note 32 also includes a table for council  only numbers and then group numbers. A further change was just on the road and footpath costs. So there was a 24 million drop between the set that you initially saw for the 23rd of November in comparison to the final one that you see now. And that is the 17 million difference that was in the prior period error note.  No. 32, as well as the $6 million that I just spoke about earlier. Other than that, I'll take questions from the committee on any other matters that they would like to raise. Thanks, Roger.",

At the risk of talking too much, we remember this was the debate we had last week about understanding the need for the change, which was the essentially double counting of assets, which became clear as we did effectively the stock take to enable the revaluation to occur. And given it occurred, you'll recall over a number of years prior to the current year, we've accepted that we have made an error  and accounting standards would require us to adjust our opening balance so that we start the current year we're putting on 2021 on the right position so that our normal annual transactions go ahead as normal, arriving at the safe place we are at 30 June 2021.  Are there any other questions folk would have? Ken, yes. Yeah, so Bruce, I think it's probably just worth pointing out, and I'll just really quickly go through this, but that prior period of change, obviously, that happened, has actually changed the face of the statement of comprehensive revenue and expense quite markedly.",

    "text": " So, yeah, so look, I'm looking here at page 549 of the agenda. So the Statement of Comprehensive Revenue and Expense, if everyone can just really quickly go to page 549.  I think it's, yeah, it is important to note that with the removal of a very significant write down in those assets, particularly the particularly the roading assets, that what has resulted is our operating surplus has jumped right up on a council parent basis.  up to $39.6 million. And of course, that was against a budget of $26 million. So yeah, so look, our operating surpluses ended up being $13 million above what was budgeted. It was actually budgeted to be quite a significant figure anyway at $26.5 million, right up now to $39.6 million. In terms of some of the key drivers, and then I guess if you raise your eyes a bit further up the page,  You know, a lot of that is about, well, a lot of the actual surplus itself, as well as these, as well as, you know, the jump up to 39.6, you know, relates to non-cash items and very much growth items. So, for instance, vested assets, we budgeted at 15 million. Yeah, they've, yeah, the actual there is 21.8 million.  So, yeah, so that just speaks to the growth in the district, obviously. It also very specifically includes quite a substantial figure for the new Waikeria prison pipeline. Yeah, that has come through as a vested asset in this period. So that's obviously quite significant.  Subsidies and grants, you can see that's up seven million from budget. Yeah, there was some extra subsidy from the NZTA or Waka Kitei as they're now known.  That came in and of course we got that Three Waters subsidy money as well from the government. So quite a jump up there. Even in terms of fees and charges, in terms of the growth story, I believe about $1.3 million of additional building consent fees and resource consent fees as our growth has continued unabated.  So these are big numbers, and like I say, the numbers are significantly higher than what were budgeted, in effect significantly higher than earlier drafts of this annual report, because previously these things that I'm talking about now were dampened down by quite a large  a large write-off, which has now been reclassified as a prior period adjustment. OK, but that's the profit and loss statement, or the comprehensive revenue and expenses. Go on a couple of pages to the statement of financial position.  And I guess just in terms of a really high-level summary, you can see now that we've now got total assets of nearly $2 billion. You can see that total asset line is sitting now at, again, I'm just referring to the parent council rather than the group numbers, $1.968 billion. And of course, total equity, so the ratepayer equity in this organisation,  is now $1.85 billion. Obviously our assets are significantly higher than what our liabilities are. So we now have, even despite the fact that our borrowings have increased substantially, we're now up to $98 million.  Obviously, that $118 million of total liabilities pales in comparison to the $2 billion of assets. So yeah, so look, just a really high-level commentary, I suppose, on those key financial numbers.",

So they have been dealt with as effectively a balance sheet adjustment only, and they do not hit the statement of comprehensive revenue and expense at all.  So, yeah, and note 32 of the financial statements explains it and explains what the numbers are. Yeah, happy if anyone else wants to comment in that regard, but yeah, and actually showing these things or treating them as prior period errors as the accounting standards require us to, essentially what that means is we do actually have a nice clean  your Statement of Comprehensive Revenue and Expense, because the stuff that is in the Statement of Revenue and Expense is quite correctly matters that only relate to the 2020-21 financial year, as it should do. That other stuff has been treated separately.",

So members, if you can go to 249, you can see again the  opinion that we want, which is essentially an unqualified or unmodified opinion, reflecting the financials and non-financials are right.  And there are a couple of disclosure points that follow on page 250. And also on 250, we have the emphasis of matter, which is, as Leon explained on Tuesday, essentially is a standard emphasis of matter that all local government  is getting at least certainly those since, you know, generally. And it's a technique used by the auditor where they aren't qualifying or modifying their opinion on the financial statements, but are saying, hey, Rita, look at a key piece of information that's being provided by  the District Council, which, of course, is clearly the longer term view that a reader may form of Waip\u0101 needs to be considered in this context, I think would be the way I'd put it, Leon.  Look, the rest I have read through, and I presume you folk have too, but reflect the basis and indeed the independence of Leon as he has conducted that. Is there any questions for Leon on that? Other than the emphasis of the matter, but in some sense this year it is standard, the standard of opinion. Any questions for Leon? If we then go over to page 255 of 719,  We have the letter of representation, which Jim and Gary are being asked to sign. It's proffered to us by the auditor, but it's being written from our perspective. So this is genuinely the letter that is being written by Waiap\u0101 District Council to Leon as the auditor  representing a range of things. It's quite a serious letter. And I just want to again draw attention to this. Leon, just for the sake of the committee, this is a standard letter of representation. You haven't asked for any additional or modified or specific representations in this letter?",

But if you go to 256, there are a number of things that we're recognizing as our responsibility.  And indeed, we then make a range of representations around the financial statements and about the information that is provided. I'm always conscious that it's things like we are comfortable that all misstatements, the only misstatements left are immaterial, we have to form that for ourselves.  None of the information has been subject to material fraud. There are those sorts of things. So, Ken, Gary, I wonder if we could just have a short discussion. There's nothing here that from your operation of the day-to-day aspects of the council would in any way endanger this letter being signed.  Yes, Ken.",

You've got a date in there in relation to the going concern and you're seeking assurances in regard to the period of one year from the 9th of November.  Now, I suspect that's because at one point we were looking to sign the annual report on the 9th of November. I think that probably should be updated to the 30th of November.

Extenuating circumstances, which are all massive issues that have flown around this society, which are beyond both Ken and indeed Leon's control. So I appreciate that. And look, it would be remiss, Claire, if we didn't also thank you, Leon, and your team.  We're particularly aware of the circumstances the audit profession faces in New Zealand, and we're obviously at a timing different to that which we would normally expect and be able to deliver on mutually. So thank you that you have got us to this point, and as I say, some fairly odd circumstances, so hopefully not to be repeated.  Right, can I just then move us to the recommendations? And Jo, just to make sure that I am on the right page, while you sent me a run sheet, I am looking at page 718 of 719 of the agenda. So these are short of the recommendation A, which I will just cover off quickly. The outstanding  that were proposed at our adjourned meeting on last Tuesday. Okay, so if we'd been able to pursue the agenda fully last week without adjournment, these would have been the resolutions that I would have sought the committee's agreement with. So I think if you want to check on that, if you go back to page seven,  of 719, you will see the original resolutions as they stood. What we have from Joe and Ken is an amended set. So A, which still needs to, well, what I propose to do, let's do this properly, is we have a recommendation here for an amended resolution, which I will go through and put  when we accept that as the amendment, we will then go back to page 7 and deal with the totality of the three motions. The only one missing is to be received. So, the committee consider the draft. So, I'm on page 7, the committee consider the draft Waip\u0101 District Council annual report  including all amendments tabled at this meeting. So for, to be specific, that includes some of your good points, thank you, Susan, and Ken, the changes that we've agreed to make, and with inclusion of the tabled amendments, which again goes back to, gee, I'm stretching my page numbers there, but where the adjustments, the prior period error, et cetera,  and unmodified opinion be received from Audit New Zealand. The committee recommends the draft annual report for 2021 to council for adoption and publication pursuant to section 98 of the Local Government Act at its meeting on the 23 November, which was the original motion, but now is continued on 30 November, 2021.  The second amendment is included in page 719, which is a very similar worded resolution, but it relates to the summary, which effectively we've also dealt with. And Susan, for instance, you raised today when we've looked for consistency in terms of the Mayor and Chief Executive's report between the two documents. So,  To do that, what I would recommend is that I put that the original motion, I'm treating this as an amendment, effectively be adopted to become the substantive motion, and then we'll go back to page seven and include it with section, or sorry, with motion A. So I'll put the motion that we accept this as an amendment to our original motion. Do I have a seconder? Thank you, Roger. I'll put that motion. All those in favour, please say aye.  Those against. Let's carry. So if we go back to page seven, please, of our agenda.  You will see the original motion B and C have now been substituted with what we have just passed. But now we have also recommendation A that the information be contained. The amendments go through as a standard part of the motion. Again, I'll put that motion. Do I have a seconder, please?  Thank you, Roger. Is there any discussion on the motion? I think we've done well. I'll put the motion then, please. All those in favour, please say aye. Councillors say aye. I think it should be a resounding aye, shouldn't it? Aye. Great. Good to hear. Those against? It's carried. Thank you very much.  Well, Ken and Leon, again, Claire has quite rightly said thanks to you. I presume you've got a council meeting to go to now to actually formally adopt and formally receive the opinion. So, again, I just want to reflect Claire's thanks to both your respective teams. And look, on my behalf, can I just say thank you to my colleagues here as well.  Starting from, well, I mean, always, but actually starting with our meeting last week, I was impressed with the review and the questioning that you did. I'm very grateful. Susan and Claire, I think you were our hawkeyes on detail. And I do appreciate that as well. As Leon said, if you want to change your career, he's got an offer you can't refuse, I suspect.  So thank you to my colleagues also for doing that. I wish you well for your meeting to adopt this, and I hope you folk can all enjoy the fact later this evening. Perhaps no more than you, Ken, Yolanda and team, and Leon and team. Now the business then, as far as I understand,  I'd like to- Just the thanks to you, Bruce, for guiding us through all of this.",
