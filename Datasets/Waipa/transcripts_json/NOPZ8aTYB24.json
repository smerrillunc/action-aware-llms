But look, I'd just like to remind us all, I hope it's appropriate, that we're dealing with a strategy that informs our plans, as in the next long-term plan and beyond. And we shouldn't get lost in the detail. And quite frankly, even the third bridge is a detail. The Te Aumutu bypass is a detail. What we need to be looking at is,  Does the strategy allow us to make a plan that is sensible when we are doing our next long-term plan? It's not about whether it's including a long-term, a third bridge. It's about whether it's the strategic direction going forward is catered for by this plan. And I'd like to say, I think Kirstie and Brian and their teams have done a fabulous job on this.  It's exactly what we need. The other comment I've got to make is we're all struggling to get our heads around what transportation, particularly for private individuals, is going to look like, perhaps in as short a space of time as five or 10 years. If we're going to meet our Paris Accord obligations, it's likely to be pretty different to what it is now.  Yeah, so that's just my starter for 10. I'll have more comments to make later, I have no doubt. Thanks.",

So what I propose we do then is we turn our minds then to page three, eight,  six and five, and we will go through our submissions sort of by topic there as we do when we deal with annual plan and actually long-term plan responses to submissions. I'm not too concerned about whether people think that there might be slight typographical errors. I'm sure those will be picked up in the fullness of time, but I'm more concerned about whether we're comfortable with the general flavour of the responses that we are giving to people who have taken the effort to submit to us  And in many instances, we've actually accommodated their suggestions around changes to our draft strategy. And that, dare I say, has been acknowledged by a number of submitters today to our credit. So starting, therefore, with the submissions by topic and recommendations, the first one is the climate change and environment topic. They're on page, it's two of that annexure, but 387.  I have no issues with those ones. And perhaps I just flick through, I say the numbers, and then we keep going. And if you've got an issue with something of any significance, please raise your hand. But bearing in mind, we're not here to rewrite and do our staff's job. We are just here to acknowledge and endorse the responses where we think they're appropriate. So page two and three.

And I did raise it when the strategy came to us, you know, before it was released that, you know, we need some  targets and there's some hard targets. So I'd just like to know from staff, what is the plan? Like if we adopt this strategy today, when will those targets get put in? You know, we're expecting like this, the government's discussion documents open now. And we're likely to hear in the next few months about those harder targets. So is there a process where we can get those  targets put into the strategy, or is this something that's got to happen later on? Yeah. Or is there the opportunity to amend it at a future time that isn't too far away?",

Certainly, my advice to Council along the way has been there are likely to be other places where a pedestrian cycling bridge would be in a better location, a better environment and better value for money.

And I notice in terms of that response, first two paragraphs are fine. The third paragraph, where it actually indicates the staff response mentions up to 70 million and 46 per year.  Now I'm assuming that the brief for the third bridge strategic business case will assess possible sites for the bridge, that the overall project costs will be dependent on where the bridge will be sited and its associated engineering costs.  the design of the bridge with its manufacturing construction costs, the purchase, protection of the roading. Can I interrupt you there, Roger? I'm trying to understand where you're going with this. The point is, I think there are so many variables within that, that any comment in that response regarding total cost of the project or the cost per rate payer,  cannot be made because it's too much of a variable. I think that any reference to projected cost and implication to repay it should actually be removed from that response.",

Because there's an alternative to the congestion, as far as I'm aware, but it's not being taken up and that would have no impact on rates and it would be a long-term solution.

Now, these figures are not designed to reflect an actual bridge or an actual location. So it's an indication to people, and I think with any of our big infrastructure items that we're considering,  an indication of the economic impact needs to be given.

Okay, so in terms that we're kicking off with the changes appearing in recommendation D, the Strategic Planning and Policy Committee approves the staff recommendations on the submissions included in the submissions to the transport strategy with staff comments and recommendations document ECM101802820 attached as appendix two, subject to the following amendments.  and then these are listed, there are one, two, three, four, five, six changes. Submission point number 157, remove the wording, no changes to the transport strategy from recommendation. Submission point 171, a written response to be provided to the Pirongia Ward Committee verbal submission. Third one is staff advice at page 34 of the summary of submissions to be amended to incorporate the work done at park  on the, should be on the parking study, yeah, in Te Omutu as well as Cambridge and a specific response to be provided for the Te Omutu Community Board in response to their submission on parking. The next one is submission point 154, a more detailed reason to be provided as to why a parking lot behind the event centre for business staff is not plausible.  And then the next one is in relation to the responses on connection of our rural communities for staff to incorporate wording where appropriate to cover the work done by the Waikato Regional Council around potential future services, such as total mobility and shuttle services for our rural communities.  And then the last one is in relation to the responses in connection with rail, where appropriate, the work of the Waikato Regional Council to be highlighted as far as it has indicated that rail in our towns is not feasible to 2050. Rail to our towns is not feasible to 2050. And then paragraph E, has that changed? It hasn't been changed, it's just that one. Okay, E and F are as they appear in our agenda.",

Yes, please. Okay, Councillor Gordon would like his position recorded. The motion is put and is successful.  Well done, team. Congratulations. Thank you, Kirstie and Rachel. Really important piece of work for us. Right. I think we're probably best just to adjourn for a short time.  The lunch actually isn't here till 12. Sorry, till 1 rather. Oh, it's here. Excellent. Well, that's very opportune. Excellent. Perfect timing. So if we just adjourn for our lunch break and return at 12.40, I believe when the fees and charges hearing is due to commence with our only submitter, Sue Milner.",
