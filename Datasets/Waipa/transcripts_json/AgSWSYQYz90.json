So I've been working in the middle school, I'm the team leader there for the youth workers, and it's incredibly beneficial. What we found was if we could interact with some of the families and the children earlier than middle school, that showed great benefit to the children. So we approached Leamington School and asked, because they're super local for us, asked if they'd be interested in having some youth workers go into Leamington School. They were more than happy to have us come along.  So we've been in there since February, 2020, and it's going amazingly well. I'm a little bit shocked at some of the...  issues that we're dealing with with children there. I guess I knew that there was stuff there, but I wasn't aware of the extent. So we're able to go in and work with a small group of children, usually about eight. We're targeting children who aren't  at the extreme end. So those kids tend to get funding for counselling and their families get a lot of Ministry of Social Development funding. But then there are children who I would say are in rough situations and dealing with some extreme issues, but they don't get that funding because they're not extreme enough. So we're able to just come alongside, build up their self-esteem, have some good mentors for them to  and just hang out. So we did science fun at the start of the year. We blew stuff up, hung out, chatted. This term we're playing t-ball with a group of kids, just showing them how sport benefits their lives and giving them an opportunity to learn a new sport. It's amazing. It's great to work alongside the children. It gives the teachers a break from some of the kids who are extra special in their class at times.  which is nice. We also hang out some lunchtimes and morning tea just to be another adult in the playground, just encouraging kind behavior, relationship building. And we also have, we try to encourage teachers who sometimes have a really tough job with some of the social aspects. So we've done just hot scones, hot cookies, just turning up and letting them know that the community  of Cambridge appreciate the hard work that they do. So at the moment we have two youth workers in at five hours each, just hanging out there. We'd love to increase that. We'd love to do it throughout all of the primary schools in Cambridge. But at the moment we are working at Leamington and really enjoying our time there. We've also just started  We're going to run a day camp in October this year, the second week of the holidays, where kids can go to Totara Springs Monday to Friday, but not stay the night. We're targeting some of the families who wouldn't be able to afford to do that, or where grandparents have the children over the holidays. So giving grandparents a bit of a break, teenagers who look after their siblings over holidays, giving them  a bit of a break and taking those kids to a really fun place to enjoy some full-on activities. And yeah, we're looking for sponsorship. We haven't asked for that, but I'm looking for sponsorship at different places to get kids to go who can't afford it. So that's kind of what we're doing.",

So it was really just seeing if there were any questions around the Christmas parade. There were quite a few questions this time last year, so wanted to see if there were  from your group and around that. The second proposal is a food trail map that we have created for Cambridge and some outlying areas as well. So the purpose of the map, we've had it designed.

You know, I'm quite familiar with it, because we use that for Culinary Cambridge, and I guess we recommended in the past that we go for things that reach further than Cambridge,",

    "text": " So I'm going to keep this really short and sweet. So one of the chamber's current advocacy work streams is the review of our township CCTV capability. And with crime escalating in Cambridge and obviously the increasing number of vehicular invasions, the chamber reactivated or pushed to reopen the conversations with the CCTV working group.  So findings revealed that there are several shortfalls and there's a need to further invest in the following areas. A number plate recognition camera in the northern end of town, an additional camera in Leamington, an additional camera on the low bridge and potentially a monitor for the community CCTVs to add to those policing eyes.  We have obviously spoken with Brian and Gary Knighton and we understand that cost to be around about $50,000. So the chamber is looking actively for a variety of sources for the overall objective of keeping our community safe.  The Cambridge Chamber members, I'm not sure if you're aware, but we recently raised $10,000 to provide CCTV live footage access to the Cambridge Police, to which obviously their feedback has been phenomenal in what that tool has been able to add to their toolbox.  And once we're out of lockdown, we'll also be regathering our retail community who are feeling pretty vulnerable for an update around the security of our town and asking those businesses to make a contribution. Now, whether that's a one off contribution or a weekly pledge,  We'll see how that looks. I mean obviously lockdown 2 has had a pretty instant impact and most of the gains that they'd made in the last 12 months have just gone out the back door again. So we know our retailers in particular are doing it pretty hard. It's good to see the sun shining today and however and you know good people out there supporting the businesses today.  We're also aware that the Te Awamutu Community Board has allocated funding for funds for the CCTV investment in their town. And so as such, I am asking the Cambridge Community Board to consider funding or supporting the funding to the tune of $10,000 to help make our streets and township safer.  That's it. Happy to open to any questions. I can see obviously we've got Gary and we've got Brian here, but I would welcome any questions to help aid that consideration.",

And we have asked them to look at an in-kind contribution also to  you know, within that $50,000. So we're looking far and wide and digging deep to how we can contribute. You know, there's no expectation that the council alone can fund the development that, you know, there was the sort of initial framework that was put in.

So yes, certainly there's some  gaps in the system that could be filled by, you know, some more cameras. And I mean, over time, we'd always plan to be increasing the number of cameras and the types of cameras. It's just we are, the way it's been budgeted in the LTP, it's dependent on the funding that's available and particularly the funding that's available from Waka Kotahi.  And at this point, we haven't actually been told by Waka Kotahi what our capital funding is for the next three years.

We've got other ones that are what are called point and zoom type cameras where we can actually follow activity with them and zoom up on particular events.  And we do have a couple of cameras that are special number plate recognition cameras, where in all light conditions, they are focused on a traffic lane and they can read number plates very reliably. But during the daytime, of course, they're just looking at one particular segment of an intersection. And at nighttime, they cut out all the other light and just get the light  infrared light that's bounced back off the number plate. So you can still read the number plate at night, but you can't see the vehicle. All you can see is the number plate. So, yeah, it's tricky to try and you can't get a camera that will do all things, basically. So we need a number of different types of cameras at different locations.",

    "text": " Well hi everyone. I was meant to just be a cameo with Debbie but it wasn't meant to be the main item but it's more around the welfare way that we've done the welfare and the way the whole response has been this year.  if you're ready just for me to kick on. We know you've had a bit of a busy year already but carry on. Better to be busy than dead, never mind.  So this year was a bit different to last year. Last year, you remember that the whole response to the COVID was a CDEM response. This year, it's been very clear that CDEM have a support role only in this response, and it's primarily DHB  response and we're there to support them. Now the government made it really clear after the last COVID that they have invested millions and millions of dollars for MSD to run the welfare response in this COVID.  in any COVID reoccurrence. So whereas before we were front and center for welfare, now we've been told to stay in our lane, and MSD will take all of the calls, do all the needs assessment, and anything that fell out of their realm of able to help people, they would refer to us. Some say it's a good idea, some say it's not, but whatever it is, that's how we have to work with.  So what happens is people ring the 0800 number, they get a triage, and they either get a top-up of money if they're existing clients, or they have to go through the process of filling in the necessary approvals and assessments, and then they either get a top-up or referred to a food bank.  If there are other things they need like heating and clothing and all that sort of stuff, they can get help there. So we actually haven't had a single referral from MSD to CDEM in the Waikato and especially not in Waipa.  So whereas last time we had a lot of referrals through the Welfare 0800 number, which we are not allowed to activate this year because it's not our response. So that's how it's been held. So our role has been monitoring and just liaising with our agencies, our food banks and seeing how they're tracking.  We're not too bad in Waipa. They're getting smashed down in Waitomo. Maniapoto have a lot of, the area is quite vast, so they have a lot of poor pocketed areas and communities that get  little funding anyway and then when the main employer goes out you know like the there's three big um abattoirs and that down there that you know usually you're getting like fifteen hundred seventeen hundred dollars a week on the chain all of a sudden you're getting the just the basic five hundred for the wage subsidy that makes a big difference to people's to people's weekly income and what they can expend  But in Cambridge, the Salvation Army report, they did 30 food parcels last week, which is a 300% increase on their normal food take, but they didn't think that that was out of the way or nobody was sort of on the take. They were genuine cases and nobody's sort of going along for the ride.  Harriet of course is looking after her normal 60 odd families and she's had a small increase of people who she said they've never presented before but she's able to cope with that. We've had a couple of referrals from her, a lady who wanted some shopping done, a good friend of Jim's.  And another one today who just needed some help with Meals on Wheels, their delivery was outside of the normal realm for Meals on Wheels scope, so we stepped in and did that.  We've been in contact with Age Concern all the way through and Brent's been good. He's not had any calls from anybody in our area. And Phillip's been, he's been liaising with  Grey Power, and I think there's a couple of people who's been helping out and doing some stuff for Harriet. But on the whole, it's been kind of a quieter response for us than it was last year. And, you know, we've just been lucky that there's nobody in our area that's actually been affected. Has anybody got anything they'd like to say at this point?",

There are people who don't think they need a benefit or they don't need money or they don't need this, they just want some  something else. So they don't even think to ring that number and that's a discussion we've been having at a group level with the Waikato Welfare Coordination Group. It's been brought up right throughout the region is that people don't like to ring MSD for whatever reason. A lot of iwi people  find that they get a stigma. A lot of communities haven't got the data or the phone coverage to ring them anyway. And so that's, and yeah, it's part of the feedback that we've been giving them, but the government's made it very clear that this is what they put in place and this is what we should do.  And so, yeah, we're gonna, like the Waikato welfare people, we meet every week, three times a week, and we discuss what's happening in our patches, and this is a theme that has come up throughout the whole region for Waikato, because we do think that people are falling through the gaps, but we can't advertise to go and find them, because it's not our gig, it's a DHB gig.  Whereas before, we could put the 0800 civil defence number out, which is sitting in the background, ready to go. All we just have to do is flick a switch and the call centre will be on. But at this stage, the government said that it's not needed, MSD are coping and there's, yeah, but feedback back to MSD is that, or back to the government has been that, you know, through NEMA, that this might not be working for everybody in our community.",

But so, yeah, we're not doing all the things that we want to do yet, but we are putting pressure on the regional council to get the next contract out and for us to be able to start doing more.  But we do see that just prior to this last COVID lockdown, we had recovered to have a higher number of patrons on the bus services in the last financial year than prior to COVID. So it has bounced back quite strongly. And across the region, the Te Amiru and Cambridge bus services were ones that have  bounce back quickest and grow by some of the greatest percentages, which is really good to see.

But through, I guess, the work that Council's been doing to come up with a new passenger transport plan or an increased service plan and government's ability to fund increased services and the like, the re-tendering of the contract has been put off.  So the regional council is the party that has to pick up the government funding and run the bus contracts. And so we're a bit beholden to them to get the new contract out to tender.

So all of those sort of points were covered in the business case and  that went into the LTP and was funded, you know, an increased amount of money was funded for the next three years.

While it's a draft, it's sort of close to final, I guess you'd say. It's been through a lot of reviews and the like.  But it still has to receive sign off from the transport agency for their funding input. And so it won't be final, final until they've done their final checks and have given it their sign off.  So, in each town, we are looking to, I guess, the most significant project that will make the biggest difference in the next three years of the LTP. So, the route that will  link up the most destinations, attract the most cyclists and be of most value to each town. And so the business case does suggest some priorities. And for Cambridge, the suggestion is getting from the Victoria Bridge  linking to both the Cambridge Primary School, but also the Cambridge Middle School as a high priority. But there is a governance group that's planned and obviously a consultation with the community that will be able to have input into that programme.",

As council adopted a M\u0101ori ward on the 19th of May, that now makes a representation review compulsory here in Waip\u0101. So what we're looking at as part of this process is how many elected members we have, how many councillors we have, what areas they cover.  whether we have community boards and how many people are on them and the areas they cover as well. So as part of this exercise and review process, we have adopted an initial proposal and that goes out to the public as of last Friday for a month for public consultation. It's just over a month, closes on the 29th of September.  which the councillors will adopt, and then we go out to the public, the community again. And that process, it's got to be open for a month as well. And so that calls for any or all of the councillors to be able to participate in that process. So that's what we're doing.  appeals or objections to the final proposal. And then if we get any of those, the matter goes to the local government commission who make a decision. So it's quite an extended process that we're embarking on. We have got some changes that we are proposing with this representation review. There's a number of them. We are looking at reducing the number of councillors from 13 down to two.  10 general ward plus the M\u0101ori ward councillor. Because of the numbers that we have in our district to try and balance the urban and rural with the growing urban, we've had to look at how our rural wards are structured, because we've got to make sure that the councillors represent a similar number of people. So as part of that process, what we have  done is combined the Poronga and Kakapuku wards. So those are the two wards that look to Te Amuru as a service centre. And then on the Cambridge side, we have extended the Maungatoki ward around to include Kaipake. So now all those rural areas around Cambridge  a part of the Maungatoki Ward. In terms of the urban ward boundaries, there was just some minor changes to them to accommodate statistical areas or accommodate future growth. In terms of the boards, community boards, Council's gone out with a very similar structure to what we have now. In terms of Cambridge, the difference will be  that there, in terms of the numbers, there's now only, there's four rather than five elected members in the Cambridge subdivision. And with the Maungatoetoe subdivision, you've now got, that now will cover a bigger area, including Kaipake. And then on the other side of the district, Tamaru has effectively stayed the same.  So that's really the key changes that we're proposing. Has anyone got any questions about the proposal or anything that's come out of the statement of proposal that was attached to the report?",

    "text": "Yeah, I guess if we discussed it last month, if you had any questions, basically, the summary was that I felt the groups that the Reserve and Landscape Working Group was connecting with were already well represented  to the council via other avenues, one being the appointment of Sue as a community board representative on the tree trust. And the other is the use of our deputations in our meetings as well, and specifically inviting the Cambridge Community Garden to come and be part of that. I also know that they have quite good channels of communication with Matt Johnson anyway, they've been part of  that new planting that happened by the Rose Gardens and they'll be harvesting that. So there's already quite strong channels of communication. So I just felt like this was perhaps not a great use of staff time by coming and providing secretarial duties for that group when they were already well-repped in other places. So that was my thoughts about it. It's only twice a year, the meeting, at the moment, but I thought those groups were well-represented in other channels.  but happy to hear if people have other thoughts about that. Any discussion on that one?",

In the prior year commitments, there's an outstanding amount of $3,024  left over from the welcome to town signage. I have asked the finance team to move that back into uncommitted funds. The recommendation that was passed when we set aside the funds was to once all spent then return any unused funds back to the uncommitted.  I have confirmed that all the accounts have been paid for, so that can go back to our uncommitted funds. The other good news is there was an outstanding $700 from the Anzac Day. I have been waiting for one more invoice to come in.  last week for $100 for the Cambridge brass band. So once that gets paid, then we've got an additional $600 there to return to uncommitted funds. So based on those two amounts being returned to uncommitted funds, that would give you $60,327.25.  for your discretionary spending.",

They've actually just taken over part of the horse paddock adjacent to their building to provide extra car parking for their members when they  have their working day, they will go and park their cars in the paddock now, and they then get in the vans, the van or sexual transport and go off and do their gardening around the district.

With Horo, like Graham mentioned earlier, it was really great that they were able to send through to us the details of their Paralympian that was competing. And we've obviously let them know about our  athletes, particularly Elcha Mazbender, the paracyclist, who's had one race on Tuesday and she's got another one coming up on Thursday.

The time that the government has given us is very, very limited, and we've always been pretty brassed off with that. So that is being done in haste to get out to the public. I don't know the comm strategy at this stage or the timeframe for that, but I know that it's pretty imminent.",

I think you'll see Tarong District, Tarong City Council have done it, I think Hamilton have done it, but we need to do it as well on our own right. And I think that strength of those submissions coming from each of those councils is probably where we want to fit. So, we've got some grunt there. Public submit back to council their thoughts on three waters and then you'll take it up to central government.  Yeah, well, we get the feedback from the people, but they're limiting the time very, very, it's very, very condensed, very, very condensed. So it's getting together with haste.",
