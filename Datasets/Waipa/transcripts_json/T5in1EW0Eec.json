    "text": "Yeah, sure. Thanks Kaylene or Maureen or Tato. So the couple of couple of things that were outstanding from the last meeting. First of all, Dominic raised the issue of a potential portal for resource consents. So I've investigated that with our IT and business excellence departments.  I think there's a good opportunity there that we might be able to do something. I'll have to put together a business case and I guess line up exactly what functionality would be, you know, would be in that portal.  So I'll commence that work over the next three months and get it into our system. So I might just need to check in with you, Dominic, just to make sure we get the functionality right, so it's okay. So put that business case together. It wouldn't fit into this financial year's program, but we're hoping that if business case is accepted and everything, that we could go through to the next financial year. So I'll action that.  The second one, I think Dominic also raised around the Te Kaua maunga and the level of protection there versus other sites. I've had a conversation with Fiona Hill who put together the original plan and this would have been stepping back about 12 years ago. So she put in place the cultural  cultural landscapes, areas, etc. She did note that that was kind of, you know, things have changed quite a bit over 12 years.  What was leading edge sort of stuff now is, you know, might be due for some more update. But she couldn't remember specifically anything about Kaua Maunga. But she did say that the cultural landscape sites were especially where they were, you know, we're very aware that there might be  k\u014d iwi in there. So, you know, where people might be buried in there, that was a trigger for that. Also, so I guess the real question is how do you achieve that sort of level of protection? There is still not a, you know,  the cultural landscape sites in and of themselves don't give all that much further protection. There's a lot of reliance on consultation with landowners, et cetera, as well. The Pirongi  And kakepuku maunga also have significant landscape overlays on them, which give them even more protection. But I guess ultimately, we do have a Sites of Significance plan change on the books. It is a bit further down the track.  Well, it's been, the district plan team have been sort of so overwhelmed with plan changes, they haven't been able to get to it yet, but that's probably the best solution is to look to that site for significance plan change. There would need to be some kind of plan change in some form to increase the level of protection on that site. But that's kind of the best I can offer at the moment.",

Yeah, just through you, that's part of the issue is, you know, landowner cooperation was a significant issue in getting the cultural landscapes in place.",

    "text": "Thank you, Gary and Mr. Mayor. Yes, probably we know that some of the resource, the structure that's been built there has already been approved. So it was, there were a couple of objectives we were looking at at this. And the first one was to,  just to identify how it came about that Tikawa had a different status. So thank you for that, Gary. And the second one was to see if we wanted to change that in the future, if we wanted to be able to increase that, how would we go about doing that? And it would also be an example for Ng\u0101iwi, T\u014dpua, Waipa, if we find other areas  that are in the lower category or the lesser category, then this would be a, I guess, a process we could follow to get those rates elevated to the same level. So I guess we're sort of the guinea pig to see how we go about doing this. So no, nothing pressing at the moment because it's already going ahead, but I'd still like to, so thank you, Gay, I'd still like to stay on top of this so that we can set the precedent if we need to do this in future.  As I said, I think that Sites of Significance plan change is probably the vehicle, but we just, I know Tony Quickfall is on later, but he's on the line at the moment, but I know they are under a lot of pressure with other plan change work.",

And so I had a communication from a planner requesting the same about discussing with iwi to build the house on where he wanted to. I replied to him that the iwi did not support the application and he has not come back with anything as of yet.  Otherwise, what else have we been doing? So now we continue to work with council staff where required. Hazel and Hopai continue to work on the reserves naming. All members have continued to work on resource consent applications and we continue to have relationships with the owners and their properties.  We met with James Whetu, Papak\u0101inga P\u0101 and Change 23. We look forward to working with council in that space. And myself, Phil and Poto continue to work in the ahu aki space. The only other thing that I wanted to raise is that one thing, another thing that Dominic was doing was around an administration role. So I've requested  I didn't think it was a huge thing, but it's becoming one. Just an average number of applications that Ng\u0101ui T\u014dp\u016b have processed in the last three years, but seems to be difficult to get that reply from Council.

When I first started my career, I was a resource planner, so my job was to advise the business on how much staff they needed.  various times of the year, various times of the day and so forth. And so in order for me to get an idea of how much of the workload is and whether we need an admin officer, how many and what regions, I'd really need that metadata, that data from Council. If you have numbers, I'm looking at volumes,  for how many resource consents are submitted. If it can be broken down into region, even better. As I know for Kakepuka region, my region, we don't get very many, but the other regions do. So the more data I get in terms of volumes, the better I can predict  how much staff we're going to need to be able to handle these things. In terms of how long it takes us to process it, so we've been doing the analysis here to see how many hands it goes through and so forth. So that's on our side, but if I can just get those volumes, because we haven't got an accurate capture of it, that would be great. So Gary, I might flick you an email offline and we'll touch base.",

So those were covered with Ng\u0101i Taup\u014d Waip\u0101 on Monday, and they're also included in the report to the committee today.  But what we heard on Monday, if I can attempt to recap on that, was in response to, should the council be making an application for this Trench 1 funding now? I think the answer was, well, the response feedback was that the council should  do its best to obtain tranche one and two funding over the right time. And whether all or some of tranche one funding should be applied for now was not completely determined.  I guess it depends on the nature and the mix of the projects that were being proposed by the council. But I guess overall the support is to apply for this funding from the government. So tranche one funding is grant funding and tranche two is yet to be fully determined and advised, but that will happen probably in 12 to 18 months time. The other responses that we had  around the seven projects, I guess, related to the lack of ability to have advanced warning of this information. And so the representatives felt that, you know, that was being handed to them fairly cold, which was the case.  However, in response to the seven projects, we also asked whether there were other projects and initiatives of interest to Mana Whenua and Iwi, and certainly  there was a strong interest expressed in trying to progress the Papak\u0101inga residential development in Waip\u0101 district and specifically around draft Plan Change 23 as a very high priority work area.  And then on reflection of the seven shortlisted projects which the council had identified at its meeting on the 26th of July, there was the feedback I believe we received was that Te Arawai was an agreed number one priority from that list of seven.  There was some high-priority interest from Ng\u0101ti Apakura and potentially others in the Lake Ngarauto or Wairarauto Management Plan heritage restoration work. There was also some interest in  the Resource Recovery Center Development Project and the Urban Mobility Network Program. So I think that would be my recap on what we heard on Monday. So perhaps I'll just stop there for any comment or questions.",

So from that, I have had some discussion with Tony Quickfall, which he mentioned before about the possibility of a project to advance the work on District Plan Change 23. And Tony has done some  work previously to estimate the costs of that work to get the plan changed through its RMA processes, and I guess approved and adopted. And to doing that, I guess the point would be  then the plan change would be in place and it would enable implementation phase of actual development work under the plan change. So Tony's, and I hope he doesn't mind me sharing, but his estimate  So this is still an unconfirmed estimate, but nevertheless, about $260,000 at largely outsourced work from the council to progress this district plan change 23 over.

We have funding for the first task, which is to scope everything up to figure out the size of the plan change, but we don't actually have funding yet to do the plan change. And the reason for that is because of our priorities have changed considerably with the intensification plan change, which came out of the blue, all our resources and efforts have gone on to that. And the funding that we had for some of the other plan changes, we expect to sort of be taken up by some of that as well.  The short answer is we don't have funding to complete the plan change, and this seems like a really good opportunity if we could tap into some of this money to commit to Plan Change 23 Papak\u0101inga. And it did occur to me, just as we were talking, and Gaelian mentioned it too, whether, this is not part of Peter's report, but whether there is an opportunity to also include the sites of significance, that we'd need to consider whether that's in scope.

Just before I open it up to questions, and Peter did touch on it, the first tranche of money, the 500 million is, as I understand it from all the discussions that I've been involved with, is effectively taxpayer funded. So we're all  paying for it in a roundabout way. And therefore, if we decline the funding, effectively, all we're going to be doing is subsidising other areas around the country. It would need all councils to say, no, we don't want to pick it up. Otherwise, as I say, we're just going to be subsidising other areas. So it would be a  I was going to say a foolish move not to pick it up. The second tranche of money, predominantly, as I understand it at the moment, is to be funded by the new entities because it kicks in after the new entities are established.  So the effect of picking up that money will mean that the costs just go on to our water charges that everybody will be paying. And again, I would suggest that if all of the local government areas club together and said, no, we're not going to accept that money, it would mean a lower water charge. But if some were to accept it, it would be exactly the same position where  If we refuse that, then we would just be cross subsidising other areas. So it's a decision that's got to be made later on.

I gave a report to Ng\u0101iwi T\u014dp\u016b, but I think that with the councillors here and other iwi here, I did want to repeat, and I hope it's acceptable, the fact that there weren't, as I understand it, any K\u0101nohi rep at the council where these seven were chosen and where the discussion occurred about  whether the council should uplift the money or not. So, I am, however, pleased to see that it is going to the service delivery team on the 20th. And I'm the k\u0101nohi rep on that service delivery team. But it was, you know, just if I might just point out that it would have been good to have Mana Whenua in when these seven were being discussed. I know I've heard the report that they are in the long term plan,  not being at the table on the day, I thought, was, can I say, an oversight. And it appears that it is being corrected with it now being put in front of the service delivery on the 20th. So, with that having been said, you know, because, you know, that's my Ka Nohi hat that I'm wearing there. I just didn't want for us to be asked questions about why it is that  you know, we may or may not have been part of the decision making on the seven. The other point is that at Ng\u0101iwi T\u014dp\u016b, we did ask about papak\u0101inga being placed as a higher priority because it isn't in the seven.  although it is one of the three key factors in terms of this funding. Housing, certainly, I mean, is a key factor in terms of this funding. And we did ask, and I think Harold put it quite succinctly on Monday,  asked the question about whether we were able to go back to the providers of this funding to see if we could use the funding in the way that Tony's described and, you know, uplift two hundred and sixty thousand so we could move this priority, although it may not have been in the LTP, forward because, you know, I'm hearing that  The organisation has it as a priority, but certainly as M\u0101ori, we have it as a priority, and others can speak to that, I suspect. So, yeah, if we can push that that $260,000 be gained from somewhere else to move along the papak\u0101inga suggestions, the rule change for the papak\u0101inga suggestions,  I think that everybody that is M\u0101ori on this ZUI would be supportive of that.",

Staff have pulled the  the issues or the items out of our long term plan that comply with the criteria that has been set by government and council haven't actually determined anything as yet, Bill. So keeping everybody informed as much as we can is always challenging. But look, there's been no decision made which of those projects or if any of them are  are going to be funded out of that package. So, yeah, look, we need to keep talking and keep the lines of communications open because we have to move quite quickly on this one. Harold, you've got your hand up.",

    "text": "Yeah, thanks, Jim. Yeah, just trying to support the stuff that Bill was talking about also.  From the perspective of the people that are going to be the creators and the occupants of Papak\u0101inga, it's not just about what council needs to do. The whole process, for example, from the experience that we're finding right now in the project that we've been doing since 2018, the greatest volume of work is in the bringing together of the communities.  and providing them with all the requirements that they need to be able to create those papak\u0101inga. So papak\u0101inga aren't quite the same as the subdivisions that you have in the urban space, because that's a design with an intent to simply do that for their purpose.  and it's allowable in every aspect of the district plans. Papak\u0101inga are something new to, I'll say, Western society with respect to district plans, et cetera, and they've been treated in different ways by different councils and different local authorities. However,  All the Waipapi M\u0101ori are interested in is their council in their land. You won't find Papakainga on general land. And that's something that no one's recognising in this whole process of creating a plan change for Papakainga.  Because our intention is not to provide for every person in the country to have proper kainga. Our intention is to provide homes for our children who are living in vans out on the street at the moment.  and they're not there by choice, they're there because we all know that it's almost impossible, not only for M\u0101ori, but everyone else, to get into an occupation of a home. So papak\u0101inga to us, as mana whenua, is a better use of our land rather than fattening stock on it. And it has a longer term advantage to our society here in Waip\u0101 if we do that.  Because by providing those opportunities, those accommodation opportunities for our whanau when they come home, we're not going to be adding to your social problems within my park. So I think it's a win-win situation for all of us. And I'll say that to give some cultural context to what we are trying to deal with here.  So at the moment we have this bit of funding that's available. And all we're saying is that we think Papak\u0101nga should be a high priority on that list. The fact that you don't have, right now, any plan before you is because no one ever knew about this. And even if we'd have known, we'd have done something about it. At least you would have had something before you right now.  Unfortunately, we're a bunch of people out there in the community. We're not organisations like councillors, for example, and other organisations that do that sort of thing. So our message is clear. All we want is to be able to use our lands for a better purpose.  and that better purpose is by creating Papak\u0101inga. Now, if this fund can help, and I'm assuming that the Plan Change 23 is the reference to Papak\u0101inga Plan Change, if that funding can help speed that up so that when I'm ready after Christmas to start building Papak\u0101inga on one of our blocks, then that's a good,  and very viable and very valuable purpose for the use of that money, because it will help our people. And I can't say this clear and loud enough, that we were at desperation point. We're past the point of saying, look, let's be reasonable about this anymore. We can't be.  because everyone else is suffering and we're suffering worse. So this is a good opportunity for us to be able to utilise what's available for us. I don't have the answers how we can do it, but what I'm saying to council is that help us to do it. We need to do it. You can't go ahead without not doing it because it is so vital to our future communities.  And thank you.",

And I just want to, I guess, make sure that for the iwi consultative committee, that we get the structure of that right.

I guess, first of all, we've never made k\u0101nauhi members members of the  Iwi Consultative Committee, and I just want to check if that is something the committee would want to do.

And I think the first one was around whether the incoming M\u0101ori councillor should be a member of the Iwi Council.  My view is yes, yes, because they represent our interests. And quite differently to any other councillor on council, they cover the whole district of Waipa.  So they don't only represent, for example, the Manipoto view or the Rotorua view or the Ng\u0101ti Hau\u0101 view, they represent all our views. And I think their input at iwi council in the future is going to be very valuable.  And I think the second issue that he is raising around whether Kanohi members should be also there. I thought also, as part of that paper, the question also referred to whether they would be still in existence once the M\u0101ori councillor was elected.  With respect to the first one, whether they should be on the Iwi Council, the view of Mani Poto-Kitiraki is yes, they must be on Iwi Council.  because we put them there to represent our interests on those committees. So that leads into the second part of the question. Should they still be there after the election of a M\u0101ori member? Most definitely. I don't think the\u2014  election of a M\u0101ori-owned council should change how the design or the intent of the standing committees should operate, and where and who they should report to.

So, look, all of the committees of council, it's just a standard procedure, has to be reset every triennium, and it'll be dependent on, obviously, who's elected from the council. We, as an outgoing council, make recommendations, obviously, but it is over to the new council.  I haven't heard anything around the existing table that would suggest that the Tikanohu reps weren't going to be continued. So, I would envisage that would be the recommendation going forward. So, certainly, there's been no negative discussion over that particular issue.  certainly would take on board that the M\u0101ori ward member should be part of the committee. So, I suppose we get down to the issues really in terms of  who we should be recommending going forward being the council reps. And I suppose we've always considered it that the chairs of the committees have, I suppose, got some additional responsibility and they were the appropriate people.  But there's no\u2014or there's nothing to stop any other member of Council coming to the meetings if they wish, but they just wouldn't have voting rights. But there could well be a change there if you thought that that was appropriate. And then, as Gary's mentioned, is the name appropriate as well?

So the Te K\u0101noe reps at iwi consultative  would be awesome, would be absolutely awesome. But it does two things. One, it limits who will apply for those positions because they're really specialized fields. But that can be overcome if the agenda is administered for an ability for them to have an input.  The second one, should the ward member become a member of the iwi consultant subordinately? But in saying that, the ward member has to be an independent, and surely because they represent wider than Ng\u0101i Ritupu itself, and wider than the iwi consultant itself, so it would be an independent person at the table. That's probably,  all that I can say right now. But it's always good to have all those members at the table, but it just has to be administered correctly so that iwi gets to have a time where they can put their point of view across. The k\u0101nohi can do their points of view, and the same with the ward rep.  So the forum that we have now will definitely change. Will definitely change to accommodate those skills that will be around the table. Because not forgetting the iwi representatives also that are around the table.",

The intention of getting, no, I'll rephrase that. We were instructed by those kaum\u0101tua, those elders of the time,  to make sure that when they sit down to talk with council, they only talk with the bosses, the leaders, the authority.  And that's how the composition of the Iwi Council, with respect to councillors being the chairs of everything and the mayor and deputy mayor at the top, was on the basis that our leaders at the time would only speak with the leaders of the other side.  And that has proved its worth right over the period, as you might recall, if you well know. But going into the future, I'll go back a step. The reason why they did that, because there were no M\u0101ori members on council. Going into the future, we will have a M\u0101ori member on council. And they will be our leader.  They will be our choice to put on council. Why would we not bring them into this forum when we have these discussions about council?  I just place it on the table for people's consideration going forward. I don't expect a decision now. We won't put ourselves into that position at this moment. But I think we need to consider carefully the historic status and creation of this organisation we're sitting in right now and how we can maintain that kaupapa, that tikanga as we go forward.

We thought we'd put it on the agenda today and I'll just highlight a couple of key points that might be of interest to this committee. So the first one is probably just an update on the RMA reforms.  So we are expecting the bill to come out at the end of this calendar year, and the Act to come out maybe October next year, prior to the general elections, we expect. It is shaping up, and the Ministry is putting out communications around how it's shaping up, and a key part of that, and a big part of that, is around iwi M\u0101ori engagement.  I guess what will be different in the reform, and it's been signalled quite clearly, is more opportunity up front in making plans for iwi M\u0101ori to be engaged. We don't know quite what that looks like yet, but that's a very clear signal. And that will be involvement in the first regional plan that we're developing. So if you recall, the proposal is that they take all  all the regional plans, so that's all the territorial district plans, and any regional plans from the regional councils, put them into one unitary plan, one complete unitary plan, and that's a whole new plan that needs to be created. So I guess just signaling the opportunity for involvement, increased involvement in that process. We do expect there's gonna be quite a big transition through that process.  We don't know what that looks like yet, but the Ministry has signalled that there'll be a secretariat that needs to be set up to support the regional joint committee, and that regional committee will have iwi representation on it. Again, a lot of unanswered questions as to what that make-up looks like, how the committee members are appointed, or if they're nominated. We don't know yet, so that will probably all come through in the bill.  I want to update you on that, and also our district plan work programme. I'll just scroll down to where that is. As I said, there's a lot of information in this report. So that's on page 73 of the report itself. We do have a table in there about the district plan programme. You'll see that the iwi site significance isn't on that programme. As I mentioned, we've got a number of changes which are not on that table because they've been parked because we just don't have the resources.  we've heard the discussion this morning around a desire to do that when we can. Probably just very briefly, I'll take you through this, it's probably worth doing that. So we have notified Plan Change 26, so that's a mandatory plan change, which is residential intensification. You may have heard a little bit of or been following that in the media. It's not one that our council supports because it was kind of forced on us and we don't think that  it's appropriate, or that we're ready, or the fact that we can service a whole lot of intensification in Cambridge, Te Aumutu and Kihikihi. Nevertheless, we have had to do this plan change, so it has been notified. There'll be an independent hearings panel, and it must be independent, that's mandated under the legislation, and they'll be hearing it. The first set of hearings will be just scene setting, that'll be February 2023, and then the substantive hearings will be  looking at towards the end of April, 2023. Hamilton City and Waikato District are also having to do similar plan changes. On our hearings panel, we did quite a lot of work in putting that together. There were discussions with Waikato Tainui about an iwi representative, and in the end, Vicky Morrison-Shaw was appointed for a dual role. One is given her legal background, if you know her, she's an Auckland barrister.  And I'm not sure if she whakapapa is to iwi, but she certainly has tikanga knowledge and expertise that she can bring to the table. So she is the nominal tikanga representative on that committee, on that hearing panel. Plan change 17, that's haupapu industrial zones. So there's three components of that. One is, I suppose, a technical alignment of a structure plan, that's an industry plan, so it's fairly,  fairly non-contentious, it's just a line infrastructure plan. The second part of that is we've got a growth zone out there called C9, and at the moment that's programmed for development after 2035. A lot of that has already been rezoned via resource consent for industrial anyway, and we are getting a lot of demand for industrial land, so we thought that it was appropriate to bring that zoning forward, so what we're doing is looking to live zone that to industrial. It's already programmed for that,  That's just a timing matter. And the third part of that is there's a new area, a rural area north of Hotapu Road, where we have a willing landowner, and they submitted on the future proof growth strategy, which identified this as suitable for rezoning. So we've taken the opportunity in plan change 17 to rezone about 20 hectares from rural to industrial. We're looking at notifying plan change 17 towards the end of September.  And we will be putting a letter out seeking guidance, as we required under RMA, as to whether there's a feeling that we need to have a tikanga commissioner on there. So at the moment, we've got three elected members, but we don't have a tikanga commissioner. So we'll be asking whether you think we need to do that. Plan change 19. So that's Carter's Flat. It's a fairly straightforward plan change. What it proposes to do there is  live zone and existing deferred zone, so it changes it from industrial to commercial. We've had a number of workshops with the landowners down there and the Cambridge group of developers. They're very supportive of it. It's been signalled in the trip plan, so it's pretty low key in one sense. That has been notified, so that's open for submissions now. Again, we've got three elected members who've been appointed for commissioners, but we don't have a tikanga commissioner on there yet,  So again, we'll be putting out an invitation as to whether you think we need a Te Kanga commissioner for that one. Private Plan Change 20. So that's a private one that's been launched by the airport in a neighbouring landowner. Council, of course, is a shareholder in the airport company. So to manage that conflict, we've got two commissioners on board there. Ellen, whether you may know, has done a lot of work in the airport, will be chairing it.  And we were lucky enough to get Anton Coffin, who many of you will know. We didn't think we would get him because he's so busy. He's available, so we're looking at locking him in for March to have hearings around that. It's a fairly straightforward plan change on the face of it. They're looking at extending an already existing zoned area, but we know that being the airport, there will be high public interest. So we're looking at notifying that one towards the end of September as well.  So you can see those are four plan changes, relatively high workload. And with Joe having recently left and us recruiting for a team lead, we've got a brand new district plan team. So we've got two graduates who are new to district planning. So that's part of the resource challenge that we've got at the moment. We've got a perfect storm of really busy workload, a brand new team who we're onboarding to know about resource management, and a team lead that we haven't yet recruited. So that's one of those perfect storms  That was probably all I wanted to do, Your Worship, just in terms of updating on that. I'm happy to take any questions on either what I've talked about or any other part of that report. Thank you.",

I got excited when I saw the report, because I thought you had some resource consent numbers there, some statistics, which I was talking about earlier, and I was thinking, ooh, can I use those?

Take the report as read, just highlighting that we have undertaken a further round of hui with mana whenua and iwi in respect of ahu aki, and particularly focused in that round on the long-term plan and community outcomes. So with that session, which we received some great feedback from those in attendance,  We posed some questions that were shaped around our community outcomes, socially resilient, cultural champions, environmental champions, and being economically progressive. We are moving to a joint partner workshop which is to be held next week. We're really very much looking forward to that. That will be attended by elected members.  representatives from Mana Whenua on the PCG. So those in attendance today are Gaylene, Bill and Harold, Portal as well, and representatives from each of the JMA partners. So there will be representatives from Raukawa, Waikato-Tainui and Mania Portal.  The purpose of the workshop is to agree a preferred scenario, which can then form the basis of a recommendation to the new council post-election, but also, and possibly most importantly, is to build on the relationships that we've been developing through these stages, through the development of  ahu aki and also those current relationships as between council mana whenua and iwi. I'm happy to respond to any questions, but otherwise really looking forward to that workshop next week.",
