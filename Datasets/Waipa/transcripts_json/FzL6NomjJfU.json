Obviously, at the moment, when this was organised, we weren't expecting it to be in lockdown once again, so changing times. But look, I'll hand over to Kirsty and then we can run through the session.",

    "text": " Kia ora koutou katoa, Your Worship and councillors. We'd like to extend a warm welcome to Brad back to Waipa, albeit remotely. As you know, Brad is a principal economist with Infometrics and is well familiar to you, having worked with us to redevelop our annual plan through lockdown in 2020 and also having had input into the development of our long term plan.  So today, Brad is going to provide us with an update on the Waip\u0101 economy, sharing with us his insights into the impact of this lockdown and the restrictions that are likely to further follow. Brad will be sharing his screen with you. We are live streaming this presentation, recognising that it will be of interest and benefit to our community as a whole.  We'll ask that you hold any questions to the end of the presentation, note them down, and there will be an opportunity to come back and engage with you. And we will be uploading this presentation to Diligent with also a view to putting it on our website so that the community can have a look at it. So thank you, Brad. Over to you.",

    "text": " Awesome. Good, everyone. Good afternoon. It is wonderful to be back. I do have rotten luck trying to get to Waip\u0101. It seems every time there's a lockdown, it seems to coincide with a trip. In fact, I think the last four times I've made it, three times rather, I've tried to make it to Waip\u0101, only one of them's managed to get through in person.  Look, I do think just to start off with and sort of some covering remarks, we do still exist in a very uncertain time. And I say that because of how difficult it is to judge where the New Zealand economy, where Waip\u0101's economy goes next. We've had a pretty good run so far in 2021 and up until just a week or so back, we were feeling in a pretty confident position. In a sense, we're still relatively confident about the economic outlook.  But what lockdown 2.0 does highlight is that those disruptions and concerns, uncertainties around COVID-19 continue to exist. And until we not only have full vaccination coverage here in New Zealand, but also overseas, and with variants of the virus continuing to evolve and spread throughout the world, this is going to be a very difficult expectation to try and manage. How are we going to evolve going forward?  because as good as the crystal ball normally is, it's pretty cloudy when COVID-19 descends. With that, what I want to share with you today is a bit of an overview to start with of how we're seeing the national economy evolve with lockdown. We've only had two weeks, or not even two weeks worth of data yet, and we're only getting that at a national level. But we'll then spin through what we're seeing coming forward, not only in Waip\u0101 at the moment, but what momentum was building up like prior to lockdown 2.0,  and look at some of those other key constraints and key concerns about where the economy is heading into the future. I'll share this one with you now. Hoping that the computer decides to play the game. I'm going to presume you can't see a PowerPoint because I can't either.  Oh, there we go. Okay, we're back. So we are back in lockdown again. That does cause a fairly considerable restriction to economic activity. And I think we've just got to realize that we are putting the economy again on ice. We're pressing pause on the TV for a bit, and it's going to be a little while until we can start to press play again. With that, we're seeing at the moment quite a considerable drop, but an expected drop in spending activity.  The day that the Prime Minister announced that there was a community case of COVID-19 in New Zealand, we saw an immediate spike in spending activity. You can see their spending activity on that day, that Tuesday, up nearly 40%. We saw that spending at supermarkets more than doubled. The great toilet paper was of 2020 coming back to haunt us, it seems. Although reports from supermarkets this time around did show that shoppers were buying more produce and fresh fruit and vegetables.  Hopefully that's because they've already stocked up on all the toilet paper. Subsequent to that, the first 10 days of lockdown, we've seen a loss of over $500 million worth of spending. That's half a billion bucks worth of cash nationally that hasn't been spent across in shops, with around about a 48-odd percent decline in spending. Now, that's considerable, but important to recognise that it's not as deep of a hit as we saw in lockdown one.  Lockdown one, we saw a roughly 60 to 62% fall in spending. And so although this is considerable, what we're also growing to understand, this lockdown 2.0 at least, is that businesses have found ways to operate at alert level four and also increasingly at alert level three with more contactless delivery options and similar where businesses are able to operate and might be essential.  You can see sort of just how big that spending drop is though across in 2021. You'll also note that middle blue line there for 2020, a touch lower than 2019. August seems to be a rather bad month for COVID outbreaks. Of course, Auckland this time last year was an alert level three. New Zealand now finds itself at alert level four with the rest of the country outside of Northland and Auckland, of course, moving back to level three.  at 11.59 tonight. So again, we are seeing quite a considerable hit to the economy. Now, both Infometrics and various forecasters and government agencies have revised how bad of a hit the economy is expected to take at each alert level. And I just wanted to profile that here. This time, last year when we first went into lockdown, Treasury estimated perhaps 40% of economic activity was unable to operate at alert level four.  They've revised that now to around about 26%. That 26% is in line with our own expectations that around about 74% of economic activity can continue at Alert Level 4. That's a quarter not able to operate, which is, of course, quite a considerable amount, but it also highlights that you've got around about three quarters that can still operate in some way, shape, or form, either because they're classified as a school or because they can work from home and similar.  Although we are certainly taking a fair chunk out of the economy, we do still see the activity moving forward. Now, one of the things that gives me confidence at the moment that we will bounce back strongly, and one of the reasons that we did see that strong bounce back in economic activity in 2020, is spending. Now, last year, New Zealand went into lockdown in April, and within three months of lockdown, our consumer spending activity was back above pre-pandemic levels. You can see that here.  And China, of course, who locked down at the start of the year, the first bastion of outbreak for COVID-19, took eight months for their consumer spending totals to get back to 2019 levels, even though they were and still are seen as one of the strongest and fastest growing economies. Now, I say that because the resilience we saw last year in terms of spending  highlights what we are likely to see again, which is buying local New Zealand consumers who are getting out there and putting the cash that they haven't been able to spend throughout lockdown into operation that is likely to see better economic activity moving forward. We know that people save up a lot during lockdown and they've got to put it somewhere and a lot of them want to put it somewhere and so we are expecting a similar sort of resumption in spending activity.  And you can see throughout the period, apart from that dip in activity in August last year with the Auckland lockdown, we've seen pretty comfortable levels of spending throughout as well. These two slightly lower levels of New Zealand spending, highlighting Auckland at alert level three again in February and March this year. On the whole, that tells us that New Zealanders are still more upbeat, they're still happy enough to spend, that confidence is coming forward.  That's not to say that lockdown 2.0 will be completely without any changes. We still expect that the economy, when you try to shut down a quarter of it, does see some losses, it does see some concerns. We saw last week the first signs of that, a 2,000 plus increase in the number of people on JobSeeker support benefits across the country. The first substantial increase since earlier this year, right at the start of the year, in fact.  And that, look, what that tells us is that there's probably some businesses who are already still struggling from the continued effects of COVID-19, and lockdown two has probably been the straw that broke the camel's back. But again, we have seen fewer people on JobSeeker support throughout the last wee while, and that again means that we're in a better starting position to weather the storm of lockdown 2.0.  We're seeing activity, like I said, is holding up better this time around. Google mobility data showing that we're operating almost as if it's Christmas.  in terms of how many people are going into workplaces. What is interesting is that we are still moving around more this lockdown 2.0 than we were during lockdown one. On one hand, that says there's probably better activity then for the economy, but slightly worrying if we do see too much movement at level four, highlighting we might see these higher alert levels for a while longer. And of course, that looks likely in Auckland given the current outbreak.  Now, what does that all mean for the Waip\u0101 economy? Well, we're expecting that the Waip\u0101 economy continues to go in a pretty good fashion. Our revised estimates of economic activity and employment highlight that in Waip\u0101 we're expecting nearly 63% of the local workforce is able to operate at Alert Level 4, very much in line with the New Zealand average.  And again, at Alert Level 3, you can see the same proportion as the New Zealand average able to operate in Waip\u0101, just over 84%. Now, the reason behind those averages and why you see Waip\u0101 almost smack bang in the middle with the national average is a combination of sort of stronger retail activity and similar, and hospitality based around particularly in Cambridge and similar.  Coupled with, though, that still strong primary sector that Waip\u0101 has as a key part of its economic profile. So balancing those together, you get a pretty usual level of output in terms of what we're seeing across the rest of the country. That level of activity, again, highlights that although this is a hit, there's still quite a few people that are going to be able to operate. That provides confidence about the local economy being able to go through this.  We saw in the last lockdown, and we've seen in recent times, that heavy traffic activity, generally freight, has been holding up better in Waip\u0101 than the rest of the country, even as traffic activity across the rest of the country has still remained strong. And I highlight that just because, again, we expect a similar pattern to emerge as we continue through lockdown.  there still is quite a lot of activity happening in Waip\u0101. And so although we're putting the economy on ice, the temperature for Waip\u0101 is slightly warmer, slightly more towards normal than the rest of the country. Again, building that picture of resilience that you see in the economy and hopefully that ability to bounce back strongly. Now, spending activity, I mean, look, this is never going to be a pretty picture. When you tell people that really the only places you can go and purchase are from the supermarket,  or from the petrol station, there's not a lot to be done. What you will notice though, is that in the lead up to lockdown, across the 2021 year so far, you've seen considerably stronger spending activity growth in Waip\u0101 than comparator areas. The likes of Hamilton, if we compare to the likes of Hamilton, the wider Waikato region, or New Zealand on the whole, you can see Waip\u0101 there the first sort of few months of the year averaging around 5% above 2019 levels,  then shifting out up to over 10%, hitting 15% before the lockdown. The other parts that we've been looking at, the likes of Waikato region doesn't, only just manages to get to 10% and Hamilton slightly softer still. Now again, that reiterates that there was already good spending momentum. Hopefully this lockdown being relatively short, sharp and sweet is the hope.  certainly given the move to Alert Level 3 tonight, that ability to hopefully regain that momentum and see those better spending results. Now, it's important to highlight that that spending we saw in Waip\u0101 has been driven by locals supporting their own. We saw quite a lot of that last year after lockdown by local campaigns and similar.  We expect and in effect probably need to see a similar focus again this year. People who've got cash after lockdown, they haven't been able to spend, they're looking for an outlet. Hopefully they will want to see those local retailers continue and they'll put their money where their mouth is there to support those local Waip\u0101 businesses. All of that better spending activity, all of that better economic momentum in general has continued to see more jobs for those who reside in Waip\u0101.  You can see that looking at monthly filled job numbers continuing to track upwards. These short down shifts are a seasonal occurrence around the winter periods, around the summer periods rather. But you can see on the whole that strong trend now approaching 28,000 in terms of the number of residential people who are living in Waipahu employed in a job. Now that's important because again, the more people that are employed who live locally,  Of course, the more they're likely to spend locally as well, particularly with that shift to working from home. So again, those numbers for Waip\u0101 are building into that strength of the local economy coming into this. We do expect a setback in job hiring. That's to be expected given lockdown. But again, we're hoping that as we saw during this period here, when you did see the effects of COVID-19 start to affect jobs,  It's likely just a plateauing in economic activity and job hiring for a touch before we continue and resume that growth track. Looking across the sectors in terms of who's growing and who's not, we can see funnily enough that construction are a strong grower as we've been moving forward over nearly 180 additional jobs over the last year.  Also strength in retail trade. Now, remembering that was an industry we thought would be hard hit by COVID-19 at a national level. But with that strength of local activity, with the strong basis around the primary sector, high levels of construction, and also visitors coming in from other parts of the country, we've seen retail activity remain strong.  Strengthen the likes of wholesale trade also reflects a similar sort of trend. If you've got a lot of businesses who are still needing to buy stock, that's going to support wholesale trade activity. And the increase in professional, scientific and technical services probably reinforces that trend around working from home, more people being employed in that sector too.  The other end of the spectrum, that slight dip in manufacturing and ag forestry and fishing, part of that certainly at a national level that we're seeing, and I've got no reason to believe it's different in Waip\u0101, is the difficulty around finding some of those workers during the seasonal periods. That's certainly something that we've been seeing across the country and we expect is coming through here as well.  Moving forward, again, we've seen a better trend in activity for jobseekers. It's the one indicator in many regards that you want to see going down rather than going up. And we have seen that. 2021, we've continued a decline in jobseeker support levels. Current levels as of July, still sitting nearly 350 more than 2019 levels, but on the right track.  Again, we do expect a slight setback with lockdown 2.0, but given that there was a strong downwards trend, we're still likely to see that resume once we get towards the end of 2021. Important to note that there's still around 900 to 1,000 people, even in normal times, who are on JobSeeker support. And because we know we've got skills shortages and challenges around the labour market,  it highlights that work that needs to continue happening to support more people into employment and make sure they have the right skills and tools to do that. Because it's not that we don't have enough people to work, it's again that we can't match up who wants to work and what people want work to be done. I do want to profile the changes that we're continuing to see around travel, remembering that would have been this time last year, everyone was telling me that  Trans-Tasman bubble was days away from opening, and that in October it was days away from opening, in November it was days away from opening, and it took until April 2021, an entire year after the pandemic started, to get open with our nearest and dearest, Australia, and we've subsequently closed that again. That suggests to me that we are not seeing international travel come back anything like what it was pre-pandemic.  In fact, we heard this week that Air New Zealand made it very clear that they've actually decommissioned some of their old planes that used to fly longer routes. They will never fly again with the company, just making it clear that that sort of travel is not going to resume to the same levels.  Our expectations around travel haven't changed much, and so I won't dwell too much on this picture, which is a relatively still shallow, fast resumption with Australia when we can eventually get things going. But again, still not returning to anywhere near normal levels of travel. In a sense, we're going to have to start pushing this out a bit more. The thinking was we might get a bit more travel at the start of 2022.  Given that we can't even travel to Australia at the moment, I think we've got to be realistic with our expectations of travel. It's not going to happen again very quickly. We're also seeing that although New Zealanders are still traveling around, they aren't flying as much as they used to. This chart here showing the number of monthly Air New Zealand domestic passages across the domestic network. Still in a strong position, but not quite as high as it was pre-pandemic.  Instead, we are seeing more people driving across the country. It's a fact that I've shared with councillors and others in Waiap\u0101 before. But it is worth reiterating, I think, again, towards the bottom of my screen for the top and bottom areas, we can see the likes of most of our usual areas in terms of the tourism focused hotspots, Fiordland, Mackenzie, Queenstown, Rotorua, West Coast.  are all in decline over the six months to June. The other end of the spectrum, we've got the likes of Tait\u0101whiti-Gisborne in a stronger position. Not a lot of tourism to start with, so the boost that has been seen in recent times has provided more support.  and other areas close by to our major urban centers doing well. Everyone from Wellington having wine over in the Wairarapa, Christchurch, folk heading up to Hamner Springs and Hurunui, everyone from the Manawatu going across to Whanganui for a weekend, and so on and so forth. All of that, again, just highlighting that there is still a fair bit of tourism activity, but it's not moving around the same as it used to.  Now, if we look at monthly levels of activity for the Hamilton and Waikato Tourism RTO, just because these are what we're seeing in the local regard, you can see those numbers coming through are still holding up in a pretty strong regard and that there's more domestic tourism as well. We are continuing to see people having a look around the wider Waikato region, coming through to Waipa and similar. As we continue, though, I do want to reinforce the view that  At the start of 2021 a lot of tourism operators were hoping and holding out hope that 2022 would bring the resumption in travel. It now seems very hard to see that coming through and we're worried that some businesses might have been hanging out for international tourism to resume and therefore hoping that the domestic boost was just a blip before internationals started to revive. We think that's the wrong plan. We think that instead businesses do need to be quite  are finally attuned to the fact that domestic tourism and the focus on domestic travel will need to be a core element of domestic, of tourism activity generally in New Zealand. So we are going to need to see product offerings emerge and change for that domestic sector.  When we focus on a new way of working as well, I think, again, it's a trend we've continued to profile, but we are, it remains a key focus for a number of areas and Waipara, of course, stands quite well to benefit from these changes. And that is that working from home trend and seeing where people are spending their money. You can see here the Great Toilet Paper Wars of 2020 and the latest emergence in that battle in recent times.  What you will see, absent the obvious lockdown hit recently, is again that stronger profile of spending still on groceries and on home and recreation, to a degree offsetting the slightly softer levels of spending on the likes of hospitality and what have you. And again, just reiterates that people are spending more time at home. And again, if we profile the urbans versus the nearbys,  Again, you see a very similar profile again, and I won't dwell on this because I've shown it a few times, but the trend is holding and it is quite sustained. And that means as well, again, that momentum to get going post lockdown for these areas and for Waip\u0101 as well, we saw that on earlier slides, remains quite strong. The, you know, the drop already in spending for the likes of Wellington, Auckland, Christchurch, that's going to be  a much tougher start to go from a much colder engine, other regional economies able to pick up pace a lot faster. And then again, just those changes that we've seen across in terms of net internal migration as well. Now, one of the difficulties we're starting to see, one of the changes that's emerging as COVID-19 has moved through is that the  Change in our border restrictions has really quite fundamentally altered our labour market. We've had a lot of spending activity over the last 18 months since we got out of lockdown one, and that has meant that there's been a lot of demand for additional working across the economy, both in Waip\u0101 and, as you saw with those earlier job numbers, but across the entire economy as well.  Those tighter labour market settings mean that we do have to sort of bear them in mind as we think about moving into the future. We've seen the unemployment rate continue to drop a lot faster than we had previously expected. You'll see even in July this year, we expected the unemployment rate about two months out was likely to hold relatively steady as we move forward. Again, that expectation that there was still some weakness in the labour market, there was still some disruption from COVID-19.  The official numbers said actually, no, that's not right. Unemployment plunging from 4.6% to 4% on a seasonally adjusted basis across the country. And we're expecting it could well go lower still. What I guess is important to note is you'll note that we made it to this 4% level in prior times ahead of COVID-19, but we didn't go too far below it. We went a touch below it before the GFC, but not too much further.  What we are worried about this time, though, is that given we're already in this position and there's still a fair amount of economic activity to try and get through\u2014 you know, there's still high levels of spending, there's still high levels of construction, similar\u2014 that does mean the difficulty in finding labour is likely to continue to persist.  We've seen that all measures of the labour market are showing tightness. Not only is the number of people unemployed falling, but we're also seeing the number of people who are working but want to work more also falling as they get more hours as they want. A survey of businesses carried out by NZIR highlights that it's now the most difficult period on record to find both skilled and unskilled workers. That survey is stretching back to the 70s.  So businesses now reporting that they are finding it incredibly difficult to find the workers that they want to do that work. And, again, that struggle between having people available but not possibly able to fill the roles required is still quite a key concern. We see that in Waipahu, given those higher numbers of monthly filled jobs that I showed you at the start, that continuing upward shift reiterating these figures.  We're also seeing that the number of job ads across the economy is incredibly high. Now, I've extended the MBIE job ad series back to the 1990s and you'll see just how quite incredible the current level of job advertising is. Now, what we see and hear across the economy, we've heard this directly from the Waikato as well, and we see in some of the SEEK numbers,  is that although job ad numbers are high, the number of people applying for each job ad have declined quite considerably. So there's a lot of places and jobs on offer, but not as many people applying for those same jobs. Again, reiterating that difficulty of matching up the demand for labour and the actual supply of people. And we've got to be realistic that the settings have fundamentally changed for New Zealand.  Prior to COVID-19, we had over 5,000 net migrants a month coming into the country. There's now only 370. And in fact, we're expecting that to drop a touch lower, given that we've seen MIQ spaces limited because of the Delta variant and because of lockdown too. All of that, again, suggesting that we've got some big changes coming to the economy. When we look at annual net migration, I mean, the graph is relatively self-explanatory. You're seeing a much  much lower number of people coming into the country each year relative to what we had prior. That means that for businesses, the way that they used to find their talent and the number of people they were able to source as skilled migrants is going to be greatly diminished. The government has recently announced in response to a question from the opposition that it does expect to have a considerably lower level of net migration coming into the country.  Now, if that comes true, and it certainly is hard to see it doing anything but that, the government's been quite clear on its expectations, we're going to have to fundamentally reconsider how we resource our labour market, because at the moment, we're stressed to the edge, you know, there's considerable pressure building in the labour market, and in our mind, there's no real way to release that pressure. We don't have net migration to be able to bring in  those skilled workers and so the difficulties of matching supply and demand for workers will likely persist for a number of years.  And that's meaning that we are seeing higher pressures placed on inflation, but also on wages as we move forward. You'll see those early signs moving there in terms of wage inflation starting to push higher. Now, things aren't at incredibly high levels yet. Wages are always a bit of a lagging indicator, but those changes in direction do start to highlight that there is more pressure.  and that with still a lot of work to be done, still a lot of jobs to be filled, but not as many people perhaps available to fill them as previous times, we are going to see more of those labour market pressures. We've started to hear quite a considerable amount about job poaching and similar, trying to find a guy from another firm to bring into your operation, and firms needing to pay more not only to keep their current workers, but also to attract new workers in.  Those older issues continue to reemerge. We're seeing housing pressures across the economy remain strong. Our latest forecast from July, and in fact, the government's budget forecast for house price growth shown here in the dashed lines, you will see that recent growth has completely blown those expectations out of the water. House price growth now running in Waip\u0101 and the wider Waikato region and New Zealand as a whole, above 25% per annum.  That is a considerably steep level of price growth. Now, I want to give you five quick reasons, again, why we're expecting house price growth to need to slow back, and then I'll show you my next slide, which is the one reason that it won't emerge quite as quickly. Those five reasons are we have seen the government try to limit back demand with the removal of interest deductibility for investors, and the Reserve Bank has made considerable moves to limit back on risky lending.  Of course, LVRs have been reintroduced, they've been clamped down on, or they're being consulted to be clamped down on further, and the Reserve Bank is looking at implementing debt-to-income limits next year. If debt-to-income limits were introduced, at one, depending on what level you set them at, they could cut out anywhere from 50% to 25% of first home buyer lending, if they're set at the usual five to six DTI level.  Now, the Reserve Bank's not going to do that. That would absolutely cut the legs out from first-home buyers. But it does underscore that we've got a lot of people who are borrowing at very high levels relative to their income, and that does cause you some concerns around financial stability. So those are two of our wishes. We're seeing high levels of building activity at the moment as well, which is helping to address the undersupply across the country. We see still strong levels of building in Waip\u0101, and I'll get to those in a moment.  We've also got less people coming in, as I showed you just before, and that means lower population growth. And then we're also seeing very, very clear signs that interest rates are about to head higher. The Reserve Bank only holding back in their August monetary policy statement because the proximity of alert level changes. Less than 24 hours before the statement was delivered, New Zealand was plunged back to alert level 4.  The thinking was, look, given the uncertainty around the change in alert levels, let's tie ho for a minute. But the bank making it very clear that if these current pressures continue to persist and there's no reason to expect they won't, interest rates will start to rise. And we've already seen one year rates pushing higher still. Those are the five reasons all combined that we should see lower demand for housing and also higher supply. But at the moment, we've got quite a reduced supply of existing homes on the market.  If we look at the number of properties available for sale across the Waikato region, and look, this graph mirrors the national average, we can see that the number available for sale is considerably lower than usual, sitting at roughly 41 percent of usual levels of property available for sale. And so, again, reiterating what we've said a number of times before, that if the plan is to play musical chairs with the existing stock of housing, we will lose this game.  which again profiles that focus on building more. Without more properties on the market you've still got a lot of people who want to buy, not as many people available to sell, and that means that we are likely to see prices continuing to be bid up. All of that reinforcing that although we're expecting house price growth to soften and to flatten away, we're not expecting any particular house price falls,  and we're expecting it could take longer than first expected for that flattening in house price growth to occur. Now, all of that has combined in Waip\u0101 to see unaffordability continuing to edge higher. We're seeing that again, though, across the country. For Waip\u0101, on our March data, the average house price to average household income ratio rising to six.  For New Zealand, it's headed above seven. And for the wider Waikato region, we've seen it head to about six and a half. All of those numbers continuing to show that across the country, we're seeing difficulties around affordability. Of course, Waipa are sitting below the national average and below the Waikato region average. Also providing, though, some support for activity locally because people who might have been in the Auckland market or some more expensive part of the Waikato market  often might be starting to look for those other options, and Waip\u0101 still provides some key elements there. We're not expecting as much activity to come forward in the infrastructure space. The Government has talked a big talk on that front, and you can see there we're not expecting too many big shifts in infrastructure. Part of that being that we are still worried about the Government's strategy, particularly around transport funding.  We, of course, had the big bridge that won't coming through from Auckland being announced and then sort of not really announced and being pulled back. At the same time, of course, as councils around the country were given a letter saying, hey, you know how you thought you'd get a whole bunch of capex? Well, maybe not quite as much as you thought. That has caused some quite considerable concerns around the country over levels of investment and similar  So on that basis, we're not confident that there's a huge amount more that can be done in the infrastructure space, just given the capacity constraints and sometimes the lack of strategy and ability from government to roll some of that activity out. Now, why does all this matter? Well, it's because we see that at the moment there's still a considerable level of need in the housing space, the state housing waitlist nationally rising to above 24,000 after a pretty, I mean, this goes back to 2001,  and you can see a real rapid increase in recent years. In Waip\u0101 we've seen a similar shift, although not nearly as pronounced growth, averaging below 20 households all the way up until around about 2017, now sitting just a touch above 100 at present. Now, again,  That's not as big of a number as we've seen in the national figures, but important to reiterate that is still 100 households in the local area that are needing more support and are still really struggling to make their way and to stay in a house. There is still more activity coming forward, and I just want to profile that Waip\u0101 has been seeing a sustained level of high building activity since particularly 2018 moving forward.  after, of course, a dip away through the sort of mid part of the early part of the 2010s, rather, before the entire construction sector got going. So the levels of activity now are certainly high and sustained, and that provides, again, that confidence over providing more housing into the market and also meeting those demands of Waip\u0101's strong growth.  Just looking at what that looks like across a few other areas. Now, I've indexed this data, so don't worry too much about the level. Just, if you will, look at the difference in the lines and you'll see there that Waip\u0101 are trending in a higher position than what we've seen in the likes of Hamilton, Waikato region or New Zealand. And that reiterates, again, that high level of building you can see in Waip\u0101. It is worth profiling, though, just again, that you have seen that plateauing in activity in recent years.  And really, that just reiterates that there's a lot of work going on and there's only so much that you can do at any one time. Looking at non-residential, a similar sort of story emerges. Looking from 2016 onwards, you can see that that push higher in activity and a higher base load, if you will. You look over this period, 2016 to sort of 2018 or so, you're averaging probably around about $40 million per annum.  you're now at around about 100, if not more. So, again, just much higher levels of building happening locally. And the trend as well, looking from 1992 going forward, that level in recent times is quite impressive relative to what we're seeing in other parts. Again, reiterate some of the strategy that Council's taken around providing for industrial and commercial development land and similar. So, that is, again, supporting economic activity, both directly and indirectly.  Now, the very last part before I move over to some questions, and again, I guess just the forewarning here is that there are some challenges we're seeing in the economy, but they are better challenges that we're starting to have to face than the risk that we had last year, which was doom and gloom and an economy in disarray with hundreds of thousands of jobs, lost businesses, keeling over and spending activity considerably down.  But nonetheless, they are issues that I think we have to face and be serious about because they do raise concerns. And that is over some of those supply chain issues as well. Now, we know that the sector is doing particularly well. You can see commodity prices, the ANZ commodity price index holding up in a stronger regard in recent times. We are seeing a little bit of evidence of commodity prices just pulling back a touch.  For example, in the dairy sector, we've got quite high milk volumes and similar, and that's just putting a bit more supply than the market was originally expecting. But on the whole, we are seeing those commodity prices holding up stronger. Now, given the importance of dairy to the Waipara economy, these commodity prices are going to be a real source of strength. Again, it's providing more money coming in locally.  and that's supporting that wider spend out in terms of the primary sector being able to spend on their needs and those businesses supported by the primary sector, therefore having more that they can themselves contribute out. All of that remaining quite important. But it's really expensive to send stuff overseas at the moment. We're continuing to see those freight costs at just incredible levels. You know, pre-pandemic, this freight index that we were looking at sitting at around about  I think one to one and a half thousand in terms of value. We're now talking over 10,000. I mean, the numbers are incredible here. A business I talked to again in Auckland about four weeks ago saying that their freight costs shipping anywhere between four and six times above usual levels. That's a lot of additional money that you're having to somehow find to cope with these increases.  Now, what I want to profile there is probably the most important thing that this isn't done yet. We're hoping this bit here is a bit of a plateau in activity like we saw at the start of 2021. But let's be clear, we've seen an increase over 2020, a bit of a plateauing and then a pretty sharp increase again since then. In our minds, it's another 18 to 24 months before freight activity starts to get back towards normal.  And for a period, that's going to mean, again, higher freight shipping costs and similar. And we do signal that as a key concern that the difficulty of being able to have resources, get them into the country and get your exports out of the country, it is going to be a key consideration. And we're seeing that as well in terms of export volumes. If we look at the amount of exports going out by sea and coming in by sea,  You'll see that drop away in imports starting to come back, but a pretty massive hole we've left in here so far. Just as importantly, sea exports taking a bit of a softer period in recent months, showing better promise in the last few. But again, just really reiterating that there are concerns there over being able to get our exports out. What does that mean from a council perspective particularly? We do wonder about procurement and similar in terms of being able to get imports in from overseas.  needing to be quite careful around timeframes, being able to respond to those wider timeframes, but also thinking about alternatives in terms of where else production might be able to occur and similar. All options, I think, that we're starting to see people consider to be on the table. With that, I guess the too long, don't read, because there was an enormous amount of information in there, but I did want to try and be as comprehensive as possible  is that the Waip\u0101 economy will take a step back because of lockdown 2.0, as will all parts of the New Zealand economy. But we're also expecting, because of that stronger momentum in the lead up to lockdown 2.0 and the fundamentals of that Waip\u0101 economy already with that strong primary sector, with strong construction activity, with strong retail activity and visitor tourism, all of that positions Waip\u0101 well to weather the storm and to come out strongly the other side.  We do expect that those same concerns and pressures that were existing in the Waip\u0101 economy pre-lockdown 2 will exist post-lockdown 2 as well around supply chain issues, around the likes of labour markets and similar. And we're also expecting that those higher interest rates do start to limit back just how much that those high levels of spending continue, tempering back activity a touch as expected. But Waip\u0101 are in a strong position to weather the storm  and expected to come out the other side. With that, I think I will turn it over to try and take some questions.",

We've got these wider issues around water proposals and similar that are still coming through, and the one that I was talking about on the weekend on Q&A around the ageing population.

So we've got some big demographic shifts, we've got some big other issues to try and cope with.

    "text": "Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's an issue that we're continuing to try and grapple with, remembering that New Zealand hasn't really had a high inflationary environment for over a decade now, really.  Post-GFC, it's been relatively low. And I say that because Infometrics has got different views from the Reserve Bank on inflation. We're both expecting it to be quite high over the next 18 to 24 months or so, pushing above 4%. But then afterwards, our expectation is that it holds up higher, but eventually sort of gradually goes back down to more usual levels.  The Reserve Bank's view is that after 24 months sort of quite high levels of inflation from those temporary factors of supply chains and what have you, eventually they're expecting inflation might soften away to more normal levels relatively quickly. Now I say that because whether or not or how sustained and persistent inflation is will be important. Let's just have a very quick recap of the drivers of recent inflation because it's sort of across the board. You're paying more for clothing and footwear, you've got higher costs for rentals,  You've got considerably higher costs for building new properties. You've got higher fuel costs. You've got higher secondhand car costs. Food prices are going up. We could probably spend an entire call with everyone listening where they're seeing those prices increase. Now, importantly, from a council point of view, you'll also be seeing that in terms of your suppliers and similar. The costs that you're having to incur as a business, if you will, as a producer,  are high as well. And that's why you're going to be seeing rates rises and similar in pressure on incomes. Now I say that in terms of the question becomes how persistent is it and what sort of effect does it have? Well, we are in the highest inflationary environment that we've had in over a decade. I find it very hard to believe that that pressure dissipates anytime soon, because one, you've got those labor market pressures which are likely to persist because no one's coming in to help. There's no real release mechanism.  And two, you look at these other areas and you go, where are the pressures going to come off in terms of supply chain disruptions possibly existing for the next 24 months? Again, we'll continue to hold those pressures higher. And actually, the big one is that because of these issues, we've got quite a constrained amount of supply, right? At the moment, we're providing X amount of stuff, but there's not a huge amount more growth we can do on that because we've all got these limitations holding us back.  But we've got very high levels of demand. People are spending quite considerable amounts because of low interest rates and similar. And so in our minds, we actually need to probably limit back a little bit of that demand, a little bit of that spending. Last year, when the Reserve Bank cut interest rates, that was an emergency move to support the economy and to directly do that, to stimulate more spending. And what we're saying now is that without that need for that same emergency support, because the economy is doing all right standing by itself,  it's time to wean ourselves off some of that higher level emergency support onto more usual levels. We're not saying that we need to cut back spending totally, just not quite as much, because the worry at the moment is that we're dragging a lot of spending from five years in the future into the here and now, and it doesn't leave as much for five years down the track.  overall inflation is going to be a key risk and it's something that we haven't grappled with in a while. The question is not if it's high, it's how long will it remain high for. Any other questions?",

We're not sure how quickly that ends, though, just given that, you know, again, we're now a year and a half plus into the pandemic and we've still got, you know, pretty considerable concerns over how MIQ operates. And I just say that because, look, I think we've got to be realistic. The MIQ probably is operating again for another 18 months post this. So there's an artificial cap for a while yet.  Going forward, the government hasn't made any commitments around numbers per se, which is, excuse me, not surprising in a sense that they usually don't. They're pretty reluctant to give any numbers. What is instructive to think about is that the sort of long-term thinking has always been that New Zealand net migration levels generally want to trend back to about 30,000 per annum. That was what you sort of saw New Zealand first in similar  target towards last time. In fact, they targeted quite a bit lower. The thinking being that at the moment, the government doesn't have a firm steer on what it wants to look at, but given the direction of travel, we're expecting that sort of that 30K mark is probably not a bad approximation for now, given the lack of other information. Remembering that 30K is considerably lower than the 50 to 60K average we saw throughout most of the 2010s, just to give you sort of that relative shift.",

    "text": "Yeah, in a sense, I sort of expect it will from two to three points. I mean, the first one is just around general affordability, right? Like, you know, you're looking at Auckland or you're looking at, say, Waip\u0101 and you go, man, Waip\u0101 is so much better from a financial point of view. Now, we are, of course, seeing very high levels of construction in Auckland that we do expect to address some of their housing concerns.  But it is worth noting that Auckland would have to build a considerably larger number of houses than it's currently doing to actually have house prices start to decline or become more moderated in Auckland. So what that says to me is that Auckland house prices will remain at that elevated level for a while yet. And that means that, again, if you're weighing up the two areas financially, Waip\u0101 still looks pretty attractive. So I think that still provides support.  Two, the opening up of the expressway provides just that much stronger direct route again through. And so if anything, continues the pressure and the rationale for people moving because they've now got, you know, better transport linkages and similar. And then thirdly, this work from home shift, which we have seen quite sustained, has really been accelerated by COVID. And we know, in fact, that Auckland's been losing out because of that. And I think you'll see more and more people  as they consider it, as they sort of evaluate their life, where the usual patterns of people, you know, moving to Auckland, therefore staying in Auckland and eventually moving a little bit further towards the city fringes perhaps, becomes either fast or much more exacerbated in terms of people more quickly in their lifetimes starting to think wider or further afield when it comes to where they locate themselves. So again, looking at places that might not only offer  a more affordable option, but better lifestyle opportunities, you know, still good recreational, you know, and lifestyle options, but without the hustle and bustle of the area. And I say that because at the moment, Auckland is showing the steepest drop in public transport usage across the main centres. And again, very low levels of spending growth relative to other parts of the country. And again, that just reiterates that the urban centres, and in particular Auckland, are seeing lower levels of activity.  So that, to me, says that the shift towards places like Waip\u0101 will likely be sustained for the next few years still.",

    "text": "Yep, so I'll start with the second one, just around, you know, people. There's been a lot of talk right over recent times about New Zealanders coming back into the country. The actual levels of returning New Zealanders has been pretty similar in a sense to usual, to pre-pandemic, in fact slightly below.  What we have seen, though, is that New Zealanders who would usually leave for overseas have been considerably lower than usual, because, well, why would you leave at the moment? That makes a fair bit of sense. The worry is that we do see an increased number of New Zealanders start to head overseas as the pandemic issues start to wane, as we get vaccinations and you can start to travel a bit more.  Importantly, we saw a survey in recent months from MB. MB did a survey of people who've been through MIQ between August last year and January this year. A quarter of them said, of returnees said, look, if COVID-19 conditions get better overseas, I'm heading back over there pretty smart.  And that suggests that there is a risk that actually New Zealand does have a bit of a brain drain at some point. Some of our younger talent, particularly, who often might want to go over to either Asia or Europe may well resume those activities for their OE and similar. But again, if New Zealand's migration settings are changed, that means we're gonna have a likely larger outflow than inflow compared to usual. So there's certainly a risk that we do have more people traveling overseas for migration,  In terms of travel, I don't know how many people are going to recreationally want to hop on a tin can with a mask on for hours at a time. It's not the most exciting thing. I think you can get many people.  to go with, and because of that, there's also that challenge in terms of bringing more people to New Zealand. I remember last year when we were talking about travel, one of the key challenges was not as much around demand for travel, because there will be a natural level of demand, but more importantly will be that supply, just given that airlines have had considerable costs borne on them over the last 18 months, and they're simply not going to be able to resume their full operations like they did pre-pandemic.  And that's why you've seen Air New Zealand and other airlines that have actually committed to cutting some of their airline numbers because they're clear that they're not going to be able to operate them in a profitable enough way. All of that then concludes that you have fewer people traveling to New Zealand than previously and fewer people probably traveling out with a greater focus around longer term travel for migration, people going over to Asia and Europe.  and probably a greater focus on shorter-term travel for New Zealanders, both in terms of, you know, short-haul trans-Tasman or Pacific Island travel, but also that focus around New Zealand domestic travel, because people are still looking for that option onshore. So in my mind, and the numbers from overseas are relatively compelling there, that airline activity isn't in the greatest place at the moment still.  And that seems to reiterate that view from the Air New Zealand domestic numbers, that people are flying just not at the levels they used to.",

    "text": "Hi, Brad. Hey, I've just got a question that sort of dovetails a little bit into the migration and immigration questions before. It touches on the comments you said about skills gap. And I kind of think of this through the rural sector lens, if you like. You described there being on the horizon a fundamental shift to labour markets. What sort of do you see that, what do you think that's going to look like, and how are we going to address that gap?  I think it's quite significant going forward, especially if you look at our reliance in our district on particularly the primary sector. If we've got skills gaps there, whether it's because there's a lack of that migrant workforce coming in or people, like you say, potentially leaving because things are looking better overseas now, I kind of want to know what your thoughts are on how that might be addressed.",

    "text": "Yep, so a few points. I mean, there are a few key sectors at the moment that I think will be constrained  going forward in the labour market space, particularly with activity stronger or still strong in Australia, particularly around the likes of construction and, say, nursing. And I say that because the numbers are showing, you know, that there's still pretty good levels of pain activity in both sectors in Australia. And talking to people in the sector, those are probably the two key risk areas for the workforce.  More generally, I guess what I'm saying with those fundamental shifts to the labour market is reinforcing what the government was already looking to do pre-COVID around regional skills leadership groups and similar, because we're going to have to be much more focused on local domestic talent pipelines and similar of how do we build up the capacity  of our own local workforces, but particularly with young people, but also just providing sort of that stronger linkage between industry and education, if you will, and providing people the ability to get into some of those sectors. I say that because, look, I don't think we've had enough targeting and support in some of those areas over time in terms of, look, I'll take nurses as an example, but I mean, this applies to a number of areas, only because I've looked at nurses recently,  We've known that we've needed more nurses across the country for a considerable amount of time, yet the number of nurses we've been training each year in New Zealand has been stagnant for the last decade, and in fact went down in 2020. Now that says that something's not right when we have an identified need, but no responsiveness in terms of actual educational outcomes or similar. And so I say that because I think we're going to have to be much more targeted in terms of, look, we actually need to focus on  this set of skills and at these levels. It's not just we need more nurses. Let's figure out if we're talking 300, 3,000 or 30,000 additional nurses. Same for the likes of the primary sector. What sort of people do we need to be working on farm? What sort of skills are we needing in our manufacturing sites? What sort of building activity support do we need? Yada, yada, yada. The difficulty as well, I think, comes around, or one of the strategies we're starting to see a fair bit of success with COVID, at least,  is a bit more sort of active labour market support in terms of job matching and similar. So it's not so much of, look, I'll help you write a CV and off you go and hopefully you get a job. It's sort of saying, look,  I've just had Business ABC, who's looking for five workers, and I've got five guys who pretty much fit that bill. And if we give them a few fuel vouchers, they'll be able to get to the work site for the first week, and then they'll earn some money and can buy themselves. That more active matching, that more active sort of and directive system of support is becoming important. I think part of the reason we've got to be a bit more active is because we haven't done enough  particularly at school around career development and similar. And that's meant that, you know, people haven't really realised what they're going to go and do over their lifetime and certainly aren't even aware often of the opportunities that might be available to them. So their active support sort of coming in, in a similar way to what you might have expected careers development to have done in previous times. But the core for me is that you're going to have to see that greater integration of industries who want the jobs,  learners and workers who want to get into the jobs, and then again, that educational support in the middle. Now, when I say education, some of that might be, you know, your proper formal qualifications and similar, but it might be as equally, you know, short courses or similar, or just an ability to earn and learn on the job, to develop your skills in those areas. We've just got to, I think, probably be a bit more directive about that, and a lot more forthright in trying to help  create those connections. I do worry that sometimes we've been too focused on maintaining separation between different sectors and different industries, and I can understand some rationale for that, but I think we've got to be a little bit more directive now in terms of leaning on our network, supporting those better labour market and job outcomes.",

    "text": "The reason I asked my question there was because it does depend on the reference point. If we're going to look at the COVID-19 period, New Zealand's economy, rather, has done quite well. We've seen very strong levels of activity. We've seen some of the strongest bounce backs in activity since COVID-19 emerged on scene.  relative to a number of our comparators. We're doing better than Australia, better than the US, far better than the UK, better than the likes of Sweden, who I know people compared us to during COVID last year. Not quite as good as China, but we don't really have the rising middle class anymore that they do. On the whole, from an economic perspective, New Zealand's economy is certainly a leading light throughout the COVID period.  Now, taking a step back, though, New Zealand's economy is a laggard when it comes to general economic performance in terms of productivity at shift and similar. And I say that because although the economy might have been showing not too bad levels of growth in prior times, a lot of that growth was coming because we were bringing more people in to do more work. Now, that's very much the working harder, not smarter sort of focus.  And I say that because these changes are very much being focused on trying to achieve higher living standards, higher incomes and wages, and higher productivity to fuel both of those two things. So on that basis, look, the evidence is quite clear that New Zealand did need to make some big changes. We did have a  a much less efficient, if you will, much less productive economy relative to a number of our international peers. And that's something that we did want to change. Part of that comes around the focus or shifting focus in terms of high value add. That's across the sector, across the economy. It's not just the primary sector.  It's coming through in construction similar as well. Why does every New Zealander need a completely bespoke home that's different in every way, shape or form from any other home built before it? For example, all those other sort of changes, meaning that there are efficiencies and productive increases that we can get. So from a COVID point of view, we've done well. Looking back over time, we could have been in a much better position even then than what we started with. And so I think that's what those changes are designed to address.  Noting, of course, that responding in a crisis is quite different from build-up of challenges over time. We were good in this crisis because it was a short-term crisis that we've been able to respond to like a crisis. Given that we've got, you know, all these issues around housing and similar, I think you've got a question if we do have a housing crisis or a climate crisis or anything else like that, only because a crisis demands action. And a lot of these things haven't really got the action over time that you might have expected.  Good in the short term, a lot of challenges over the longer term that we're going to need to address. And that's what I think those government policy changes are looking to focus on.",
