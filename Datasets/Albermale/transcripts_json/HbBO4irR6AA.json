    "text": "Cawson. So good evening, school board members.  to all of our Albemarle County Schools community. On Monday, we made a public announcement on the topic I'm about to address. However, in consultation with Mr. Page and with Ms. Colson, I think it is a good idea to repeat it during this board meeting.  Our default plan for reopening Albemarle County Public Schools for the 2021-22 school year will be to provide five days per week of in-person instruction at our school buildings and sites. This is based on at least four developments. The continued success of our mitigation strategies and practices  Updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control that schools can consider a reduction in physical distancing guidelines from six feet to three feet provided face masks continue to be required for all students and staff. The success of the Blue Ridge Health Department's program to fully vaccinate ACPS staff who have sought vaccination and that soon may include offering vaccines to students as young as 12 years old.  And the recent legislation signed by our governor, Governor Northam, that takes effect on July 1 and requires all school divisions in Virginia to provide students in all grade levels with five days a week in-person instruction each week. Families still would be able to opt for virtual instruction. I previously said that by May the 6th, I would present to the school board my recommendation for how our  schools should operate when the new school year begins. I am prepared to say now to our board that we have begun planning to offer in-person five day per week instruction to all students beginning on August 23rd. The purpose of our extra meeting on May 6th will now be to explain how we will accomplish offering five days per week in person.  On May 6, I will provide more details about these plans and encourage suggestions from the board members on how we can improve upon that plan. My recommendation will be that the school board approve our plans as the default unless, of course, circumstances materially change. On a second note, we also have begun planning to offer a fully virtual elementary, middle, and high school for those families who prefer that choice.  And finally, on a third note, I announced on Monday that our schools will remain in our current stage four for the remainder of the 2020-21 school year. There is a careful balance in place right now to ensure there is adequate staff to support in-person students. The same is true of our transportation network. We currently employ more than 560 different bus routes to bring students to and from school.  Disturbing this balance at this late date in the school year would detract from our ability to make our current Stage 4 plan work as designed. That doesn't mean that moving forward the needs of all of our students are not very much on my mind and on our mind. We understand many of our students have likely suffered learning losses and have missed their interactions with teachers and their classmates. It's why we are doing something this summer that is a rarity for any school division.  We're offering summer programming to all students whose families choose to participate. At all of our schools, well, provided through all of our schools and at various school sites, we will be providing both a morning session devoted to academic enrichment and an afternoon session in collaboration with community partners to promote student social and emotional health and physical fitness. I hope as many of our families as possible will join us with this summer  to enable their children to benefit from this new enrichment program and reconnect with their peers in a safe, healthy, and fulfilling environment. Of course, we will hear more about our recovery plans tonight during the work session. Ms. Colson, thank you very much for giving me the floor for a few minutes.",

    "text": " Hi, good evening board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the division, and I'm here tonight with Eileen Gomez to provide our COVID-19 status update. As the board knows, we follow a five-step process that is recommended by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Education for guidelines on reopening our schools.  And one of the things the board has asked us to report on every meeting is the level of community transmission. Before we get into our slides, I do want to point out a bit of an anomaly that's taken place with the data in the last couple of days, as Eileen, who follows us so closely, pointed out that yesterday the numbers started doing some really strange things. For example, we had 65 cases reported in Albemarle County, which we haven't seen for months. And City of Charlottesville had  negative 35 cases reported on their dashboard. And so Eileen reached out to the health department and what she was able to find out was that there was a backlog of a number of cases that the health department has recently started to input. Cases are reported on the day they're entered into the system, not the day that testing takes place. So what we did to make sure our data was really  the most accurate we could is our latest data is reported from Tuesday the 20th of this week. So you'll see a little bit of a change in the date. We usually report the data from the current day. But those numbers are really throwing things off a bit. So we're going to work with the health department and make sure we're reconciling that. So when you see some asterisks tonight on the following slides, that's why. So I'll turn things over to Eileen.",

    "text": " Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin, and thank you for that explanation. I know that some of the board members follow this data daily as well, and so they probably had some questions about the big number yesterday for Albemarle County and the extremely small number for the city of Charlottesville. The minus 35, I found out, for the city of Charlottesville is because  They sometimes, well, they reassign addresses. So sometimes they get testing results in our health district, but the people actually live outside of our health district. So then they take the data out of our numbers and move them into the health district where the people reside. So as you can see here on this slide that for Albemarle County, as of Tuesday, the seven day floating average was 14.1.  That is the, you'll recall the number of cases per 100,000 of the population on a seven day average. This number has been increasing for the past 18 days, which exceeds the threshold of 14 days. So this is considered an increasing trend, but it's, as you can see, it's not really increasing a lot. The percent positivity for Albemarle County,  As of Tuesday was 2.9%. This indicator has been increasing for 10 days as of Tuesday, which does not exceed the threshold of 14 so this is considered a fluctuating trend still for the city of Charlottesville.  when we had the negative 35 cases in that seven day average that brought today's seven day average to two or something like that. So when we go back to Tuesday before we had that, the number of cases was 17.2.  for the previous average of this last seven days. And this indicator has been increasing for 10 days. So, excuse me, this indicator has been decreasing and this is considered a decreasing trend.  because that has been for, let's see, 15 days. So that exceeds the 14-day threshold. For the percent positivity, we have 1.8% for the city of Charlottesville. And this has been decreasing for the past 15 days. So this is, excuse me, this has been decreasing for the past 12 days, but it hasn't exceeded the threshold. So this is considered a fluctuating trend.  Now, I'm sorry, go ahead. I mean, I was just I don't know if you wanted me to talk about the vaccinations. Yes, please.",

    "text": "Okay, so I understand that some of you are interested in the vaccination rate for students 16 through 18 years old, because those are the only students for which the vaccine has been licensed.  for to use. But the health department reports vaccination data in categories, not specific to exact ages, but in ranges. So they have the range of 10 to 19 years old. And of course, since it's not licensed for anybody below the age of 16, that really is in effect ages 16 through 19. So when we look at the numbers that way, we have  youth who are not high school age. We have the 19-year-olds and some of them may be UVA students or 19-year-olds in the community, but it does give us an idea of what this population with the vaccination rate is looking like in this age group. As of last week, before they open up vaccination to anybody age 16 and over, we had 1,338 youth  Ages 16 to 19 who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. That was 8.7% of those kids. We had 280  individuals in that age group who were considered fully vaccinated, which in the case of the Pfizer vaccine, which is the only one licensed for ages 16 and 17, that was two weeks after the second dose. That was one point eight percent of the individuals in that age group. But then when they opened it up this week, as of yesterday,  2,665 youth in that age group have been vaccinated with at least one dose, and that is 12%. And fully vaccinated was 675, or 3%. So in just a very short number of days, we're starting to see a lot more people in this age group get vaccinated. So that is good news. And I'll turn it back over to you, Dr. McLaughlin.",

And so when you look at our combined CDC core indicators as we look at each week, you can see that we remain in the substantial range for our case incidence rate and in the low range for our percent positivity. When those numbers don't agree with each other, we go with the higher of the two. So for the past six weeks, we have been in the substantial  And again, as the board knows, we take those and we look at the level of school impact. We still are rating ourself at a low level because we just have sporadic cases within our schools without evidence of transmission. Our absenteeism is at normal levels and our staff capacity is at normal levels. And when you combine that with our transmission in the community,  you see that we're at the same stage that's recommended by the CDC that we've been for quite a number of weeks right now, where pre-K through 12 instruction is encouraged to be open to in-person instruction to the maximum extent possible. So that is our update for tonight. We would be happy to take any questions that the board may have.",

Next, we will check in on the motion to review our adopted market basket presented by Dana Raugh, Program Manager.

    "text": "Good evening, my name is Jamie Gelner, Division Program Evaluator. In March, Dr. Acuff stated in her motion that ACPS provides additional funding for schools in the division based on the percent of low-income students enrolled at each school, that is students who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.  This differentiated funding introduced approximately 20 years ago is used to provide additional staffing resources to improve educational achievement. She specifically asked if the differentiated funding is the best tool to address these gaps and if an income-only based model is the metric to use. Dr. Acuff's request is primarily research-based and questions if the strategy we're using is the most appropriate.  Because of the nature of this evaluation question, we are proposing the following guiding questions for this evaluation. What are the best strategies to equitably fund schools to close achievement gaps according to current research? What funding strategies have actually been most impactful in closing achievement gaps in Virginia? How does ACPS allocate funding to all schools? How is the additional staffing used?  What impacts on student achievement are we able to identify as a result of this funding strategy? And what other funding models may ACPS consider? Attached to the board's item tonight, there was some preliminary research from EAB around differentiated funding models for equity. ACPS uses one model of differentiated funding, but there are, in fact, many ways that divisions differentiate funding.  The evaluation will provide mainly a research brief that outlines options for other differentiated funding models and explains the process by which ACPS differentiates funding for schools. We would also answer if ACPS funding strategies are best practice strategies and find out what other Virginia divisions are doing to close gaps. The question of central or school allocation would also be covered under other funding models as well.  Is there anything additional the board would like to add to the scope of this evaluation? And what does the board hope to accomplish by conducting this evaluation?",

So I'm going to be standing in for her this evening. We would also like direction around the compensation adopted market. I know many of you are familiar with the current market we have. It was adopted back in 2000.  The market is 26 school divisions and we initially had a target to be at the median or the 50th percentile.  So back in 2005, that target was changed to be at the top quartile or the 75th percent. And then in 2017, we took another look at the market and our methodology along with Titan Gallagher, a consultant. That resulted in the change in the way that we develop our scale and use the two anchor point. But we know that a motion was made and I'll read it for you. After this budget season and prior to the next budget season,  Staff do an evaluation of the current market basket methodology. So our question is very broad. We would really like to know what compensation objective you would like to accomplish with this review of our market, beginning with the end in mind. So I'll open it up to you all so that we can get that direction.",

    "text": " All right, thank you, Ms. Jerome. In March, as you all were approving the funding requests, it was also approved by you to increase our classified salary increase to be higher than 2%. I plan to address this with you today. The exact motion is written out here for your reference. And I'll move right along. Before we jump into our recommendation though, I want to orient you to our starting point.  The approved funding request on March 11th will be our baseline for the purposes of our discussion this evening. You approved a balanced funding request with $209.9 million in both revenues and expenditures. Here's a summary of our most recent revisions. The most significant impact that you see here is our state projections, which now reflects the most recently released state conference budget.  We're seeing an increase in funding due to higher projections in sales tax, but more significantly due to funding for a 5% salary increase for SOQ funded positions over the current biennium. As a reminder, we had already planned for a 5% teacher salary increase before the state agreed to move in this direction. We've also made some technical adjustments on the expenditure side as we firmed up our minimum pay rate proposal and other approved items.  In addition, you may remember that we had about $280,000 in unallocated expenditures back in March. This brings us to total available funding of approximately $1.7 million. Here are staff's recommendations on how the $1.7 million should be allocated. Per your motion, we recommend increasing the classified salary increase from 2% to 4%.  I'll provide more details about this in just a moment. We also recommend increasing the teacher salary increase from 5% to 5.2%. While a 5% raise is in line with the market, the extra bump will further enable us to be more competitive with our teacher pay scale. Next, we propose restoring the STEP proposal from last year, which would expand our STEP program to four remaining schools.  After this expansion, all comprehensive middle and high schools will have funding for STEP. We also propose restoring three positions, which were reduced during the last budget cycle due to the pandemic. We began this year's budget process with 15 reduced positions. We've since then restored 6.5 FTEs, and we now propose restoring three additional FTEs, resulting in a total restoration of 9.5. 5.5 positions will remain unfunded.  Finally, we recommend putting the remainder of the expenditure change as transfers to special revenue funds to serve as contingency measures, as both next year and years beyond that remain somewhat uncertain. Here's some data regarding our classified market. We recently conducted a review of the adopted market and found that non-teaching staff in those divisions that responded  are providing a median salary increase of 5%. The details of individual school divisions plans are listed here. We recommend a 4% salary increase for classified staff that's provided on top of adjustments as a result of the $15 minimum pay rate proposal.  On average, classified staff will receive higher than 4% increases when combined with a minimum pay rate proposal. This slide digs a little bit deeper into the recommendation for classified staff. Here are some examples of positions who are and who are not impacted by the minimum pay rate proposal. For example, a typical part-time TA may earn $13.50 per hour currently.",

You can see some other examples here as well that follow the same format.  The proposal that we are recommending to bring back is the step proposal that we would like to restore that we discussed during last year's budget process. As I mentioned earlier, this proposal would expand the program to our remaining schools by adding 0.5 FTE to Sutherland and Henley Middle Schools and Albemarle and Western Albemarle Middle Schools.  Finally, I do want to mention that we made some other technical adjustments. The first piece is with regards to the $4.1 million budgeted in our use of fund balance. While the total amount remains the same, we did make some slight shifts within these areas to reflect our most current and urgent needs. Similarly, we've made technical adjustments within the special revenue funds, primarily to account for changes in compensation assumptions, including the salary increase recommendations that we just discussed.  Again, the total amount remains unchanged. Here are our next steps. After our discussion this evening, the Board of Supervisors is planned to adopt the county budget, which includes the transfer to ACPS. Our plan is to bring back an item to you on May 13th for action to approve the FY22 budget. The budget would then be appropriated in June in order to prepare us for the next fiscal year.",

When we have our steering team meetings with local government, we made them aware that we were going to be really looking hard at our market because of the discoveries that we had around being behind the city and the other local school divisions really catching up on us.  And so before we brought this to you tonight, I did call the county executive and let let his let him know that we were going to be doing a four percent compensation increase for our classified staff. And I gave him the rationale for it, that we had we had studied our market and that we found that other school systems that we compete with are  of doing what I think we should do, which is they couple their licensed staff pay raises with their classified staff. They do not couple it with their local government. They treat all the employees in their school systems the same. We're not doing five and five this year. However, I think having the $15 minimum really  accomplishes a lot that's equivalent to going after 5%, especially at the lower paid position. So I did talk to Mr. Richardson about that. I think it really helps that in addition to everything else, we do have a balanced budget. So we're not saying we're going to double what the county is proposing to do and we want more funding to go with it. So I think we've done it within the constraints that we have. And he said to me that it made perfect sense.",

We will also look at how our model for summer programming will serve as a foundation for learning recovery and is aligned to our guiding principles. There are a lot of elements to this project, and we will try to be both clear and comprehensive in our overview tonight.  Our goal is to get feedback from the board on the vision our team is building for learning recovery and these first strategies that we have identified. We first framed our approach to learning recovery this spring during the superintendent's budget request. As we explained then, we have been focused on attending to urgent needs of our students and teachers brought about by the pandemic and the transition to virtual and then hybrid instruction. As we move forward into the summer and next year, we're transitioning into a period of recovery  This is an opportunity to focus our efforts on strategies and best practices that we know have high levels of impact for all students. This is also an opportunity for us to learn from the experience of the past year and focus our efforts on what we have learned is most essential for students. While this year has been challenging to say the least, there is opportunity in the powerful positive power of disruption that will support transformation and rebuilding.  I would like to begin by providing an overview of how our project team has created a framework to organize our work in order to plan coordinated efforts across departments to support students. Given the iterative process of planning, implementing, and evaluating that will be needed during this period of recovery, our team first co-constructed guiding principles that will shape our decision-making and setting the priorities. As you can see in these principles, there is a direct alignment  to our school system's vision and mission, as well as our equity mission. We've provided a link to our full guiding principles document in the notes of this presentation for more information and detail. From these principles, we set about determining our long-term outcomes. Beyond the goal of making sure that student academic achievement levels return to or exceed pre-pandemic levels,  Our outcomes will also address the social, emotional, and wellness needs brought about by the conditions of the past year. I would like to point out that we are keenly aware that the learning environment of the school year has impacted not just our students, but also our teachers, families, and community at large. We want to partner with all stakeholders and seek to ensure that our efforts provide benefits across these groups.  Finally, I want to share a link to the initial logic model the team has drafted to identify key strategies to meet our outcomes. We see this document as a working document that will evolve and grow as we reflect on our progress towards our outcomes. Again, this is an incredibly complex project. We invite you to take time to review our current logic model, which we've linked here. So we see our work as a series of multiple plan-do-study-act cycles.  This will allow us to respond to current needs with thoughtful strategies that are then monitored and evaluated for their impact. What you see here is a schema for our first PDSA cycle around planning for summer program support, which we will spotlight later on in this presentation. So in summary, we're being careful to make sure that our approach to learning recovery takes into account the whole student. Again, this is not a new focus for our division.  and it highlights the point that recovery is about focusing on high-impact strategies that align to our educational philosophy and core values as a school system. We'll begin tonight's deeper dive into our approach to learning recovery with a focus on academic achievement. As we do that, we think it is important to reframe our efforts from a focus on learning loss to a focus on learning opportunities. This work is a chance to reignite our commitment to consistent application  of high-impact strategies and to do so with fidelity. Tonight, we will look at student self-efficacy and how student goal-setting and self-reflection are critical components of building self-efficacy. Student self-efficacy is a perfect example of a critical component of student success. Research shows a relationship between high levels of efficacy and student achievement. Furthermore, student self-efficacy is interdependent with student social-emotional learning.  and aligns to our division's commitment to culturally responsive teaching and its focus on creating active, independent learners through the formation of learning partnerships. As Aretha Hammond notes, the ultimate goal is to help students take over the reins of their learning. If they are to become independent, we have to provide them with the tools. So to understand how to provide students those tools for success and independence, we have to first unpack self-advocacy.  In his visible learning work, John Hattie refers to student self-efficacy as a student's perception of their capacity for success and ranks it as one of the top high-yield strategies in education. In short, high self-efficacy is the confidence or strength of belief that one can learn and experience success in learning. Low self-efficacy is a lack of that confidence. This is important because students tend to avoid tasks that they think exceed their ability and seek tasks at which they think they can succeed.  Therefore, self-efficacy judgments affect which activities students choose or avoid, how much effort they put into learning tasks, and how much resilience they have, and how long they'll persist with a task. We've linked a short video clip of Hattie on this topic in the presentation notes, in case you want to dive even further. The importance of student self-efficacy is clear, and its potential impact on student achievement is great. However, our task is to identify concrete strategies that we can implement  which are shown to increase self-efficacy. It is not enough for us to merely hope students gain more confidence in their potential. We must purposefully create the learning conditions and experiences that do that. This graphic outlines a framework for integrating a system of strategies that provide those conditions for every student. By focusing on students setting goals that are created with their teacher and personalized to their learning needs, we help them become an active partner in their learning. Furthermore,  by setting up systems for them to self-assess their progress and share that reflection in their own learning conference, they take ownership of their learning. I would like to point out that these are reflective processes based on the critical relationship between students and teachers, and students, teachers, and families. As such, they are manageable in terms of implementation, but deeply meaningful in their impact. Having looked at a high-yield strategy for academic achievement,  We will now turn to social-emotional learning needs and their relationship to student success in school and beyond. Again, we see this as an opportunity to re-engage with a focus area that has been a priority for us and to do so with the goal of improving our support of students. The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning, or CASEL, is the preeminent resource for research on supporting SEL development.  CASEL defines social-emotional learning as the process through which all young people and adults acquire and apply the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that allow them to develop healthy identities, manage emotions, and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions. As we review this definition, you can see the link to academic learning and to the strategies to support student self-efficacy described earlier.",

    "text": "Thank you. I am Kevin Kirst, your Executive Director of Special Ed and Student Services. And I do want to talk about our subgroup did go through a process of evaluating various tools and systems in order to promote what we believe is what gets measured really does get done.  And we landed on what is called the DESSA. That is the Devereaux Student Strengths Assessment System for Social Emotional Learning. And as I will explain to you in a few moments, this system, the DESSA, allows us to do periodic assessment. That allows, that really promotes teacher collaboration with students and families.  also enables us to take action in a very individualized and targeted way with students with evidence-based practices. And to outline what the DESA is, it consists of a universal screener.  which takes about one minute to administer per student. It's eight items with high reliability that allows us to discern those students that have intact competencies in the social-emotional learning framework that Jen just talked about with CASEL from those kids that need more attention, more support. With the kids that need more support,  there is the standard DESA, which then takes about six to eight minutes to administer that is more diagnostic in nature, and it breaks down those different competencies into the areas that the student has strengths in and those that they need more support with. Now,  At the high school level, we pivot. Same system built on the same competencies, but developmentally appropriate levels. We look at high school as promoting a self-assessment, where the students would assess themselves. It does promote self-efficacy and really that true  sense of the student owning their own development through goal setting and challenges that are embedded in the system. They do this both independently, but also with the support of a teacher. And that is what we could balance based on the student needs. As mentioned earlier, this system isn't just aligned with Castle, it used Castle to develop the instrument.  provides us reports and insights into student development, and a nice plus, it provides evidence-based practices that are aligned to the specific areas of the CASEL, the specific competencies at a school level, small group level, and even individual level. I'm not gonna read the slide to you folks. It is a respected instrument.  great fortune to be, to meet the co-author on the early inception of the DESA, was very impressed then because it is rooted in the theories behind resiliency and social emotional theories, learning, and also fits beautifully in our school-based intervention teamwork at the schools with regards to response to intervention, because it is also a progress monitoring tool.  It allows us to monitor how we're doing with kids at the individual level. And here's where we're backwards scale it, right? At the individual level, grade level, school level, or even for you to see how are we doing in the division in our work with social emotional learning. It has been validated as noted here with a number of peer reviewed studies and is nationally norm to give us a sense of how are our kids doing with regard to the nation.  I would like to point out one of the pieces that has impressed me with the DESA over the years, even more so now that it's automated, is the balance that the DESA provides our system in that it strikes a balance between respecting teacher time with providing a tool that is valid and reliable.  that really does give us a full array of tools to monitor how we're doing and actually put things into play. Along the bottom are a number of partners that use the DESA in Virginia or that are associated with Virginia. So we're not alone in implementing DESA as a way to implement social emotional learning and monitor our progress. And on the next slide,  I just wanted to highlight, as Jen mentioned earlier, the different competencies. I would imagine one question is, what are these CASEL competencies? And here they are outlined. Again, not going to read to you as much as here they are, and that the DESA is built on top of each of these to provide strategic information in order to enable us to help our kids.  In sum, I believe the DESA will be a critical resource in providing opportunities for learning for our kids that also provides the community and you accountability for our work, while at the same time increasing capacity of our staff through the use of the DESA. It will increase awareness and what these competencies are and how we could  Use this, again, opportunity to make a difference for kids in a very explicit way, in an intentional way. And then lastly, and I do believe most importantly, it allows us to identify the students that need our support the most and in a very individualized and targeted way, help them out and actually show progress. Jen, any questions?  I mean, I guess that's for later.",

Um, we do want to, um, mention that projects team work tonight. Um, in addition, we have miles Nelson joining us. He's our new mental health coordinator. This will be an important new support.  We also want to point out that our instructional program will continue to integrate a robust physical education curriculum as students return to school for five days a week, as we were talking earlier this evening. We know that healthy students are healthy learners. You'll see this theme in our review of summer programming as well. So thanks, Mr. Kirst. As the board can see, our learning recovery work is about refocusing our efforts and supporting opportunities to improve our consistent use of practices that have a high impact on student success.  This excerpt from a fall 2020 EdWeb report on learning recovery is an excellent summary of the framework that we're using. In order to make up for lost learning, schools must attend to students' social, emotional, and mental health needs, say experts. This may well require a shift in thinking of some school leaders. Social emotional development is not in competition with academics, but rather it is a prerequisite for success. And again, that speaks to the framework that we have developed for both the coming year as well as for the summer.  So we spent quite a bit of time framing our approach to learning recovery and delving into a couple of high yield strategies and tools that we hope to use to meet our outcomes. What we'd like to do is to take some time now to share examples of what these proposed strategies will actually look like within our classrooms. As we move into breakout rooms for this observation and evaluation activity, I want to highlight the interconnected nature yet again of what we have discussed tonight.",

This alignment also allows for a more targeted focus by teachers as they aren't trying to make connections between disparate elements of instruction. So what we'd like to do now is we're going to move into three breakout rooms.  In these rooms, you will view a brief video of a student-led conference. A student-led conference is a culminating event in the progression of strategies that increase student self-efficacy and support social-emotional learning. So in your rooms, we would like for you to watch a student-led conference. As you watch, think about the focus on student self-efficacy and social-emotional learning. How do you see both of them supported by this type of culminating event? After viewing, you'll do a SWOT analysis with members of our project work team  to provide us feedback on this framework that we've developed for learning recovery. We hope that this is a helpful way for you to see a concrete example of the concepts and strategies that we've covered tonight. So we'll have a SWOT analysis while the Jamboard to support us in this. And I just want to introduce and thank members of our project team who are joining us.  So I'll be in room one with Ms. Sims, room two, Michelle Castor, Jay Thomas, and Myles Nelson. Welcome, Myles Nelson. Nothing like a school board meeting to jump right into a new role. And room three will have Ms. Collins, Mr. Kirst, and Ms. Gellner.

And then students looking at their body of work to see how it shows evidence of their goal attainment.

It doesn't seem to me that the tools, A, I'm concerned on who would, we've had a skew in who has not participated in in-school programming already.

One of the reasons why the steering team really began to explore personalized learning and especially students of efficacy  is that when we look at educational research, for example, John Hattie has a 1.4 effect size. It's the highest yield strategy in his research. And so while we might not be able to isolate out this change, we would be looking for behaviors such as students' levels of persistence and resilience and working on tasks of rigor increasing. We would also be looking for evidence that students are more reflective and metacognitive about their progress.  And we would be looking at how that then would impact actual academic achievement data. So I think that's an excellent question. And that's something that we can take back to the learning recovery team, because evaluation of learning recovery is definitely a key element of our plans. And I think as we move into the summer, we really will need to make sure that we have those monitoring and evaluation elements in place. I think that's an excellent point.",

We definitely wanted to make sure that whatever we were doing had some evaluation protocols built in.  There was some concern about how these tools can be implemented in a virtual school and some concerns about that. One of the strengths was overall balancing the academic, the mental health, physical health,  and social-emotional learning, and the tools to do that part, the social-emotional, were pretty impressive. Would either of my colleagues, Mr. Page or Ms. Osborne, like to add to that?",

The one thing that I would say about the video was that I sat through a couple of student conferences at Greer a couple of years ago.  And it was just, they were fabulous. And there were three, and in two of them, the parents were crying. You know, they were so emotional about how their child, who could speak English in one case where they couldn't, was talking to them so well, and they were just overcome.  We were talking in terms of the overall, we liked how the structure was laid out in terms of the what for the program. We appreciated the SEL component and thought that was so important, especially right now.  In terms of wants, we had a few of these, and I don't think we got through all of them, but the difference between the relationship between SEL and mental and physical wellness. We want to get that expanded on. When will the, what you were talking about, Jen,  be ready to go and in terms of will the assessment start before the end of the school year? Will they start after the end of the school year? When will they be, how long will it take to get it analyzed? Because if we want to go into the summer school with some of this, you know, it would probably need to be pretty quick. I can't quite read that one. Want to know.  Judy, if you can read that one in the top right-hand corner there, I sure would appreciate it.",

And I have no idea on that one either.  Down in the opportunities, I made the comment about I think that CRT training will be absolutely invaluable for this because it can go across every group throughout our schools. And I think every family and every student will benefit from that.  And June made a great point in terms of we've got to seize on the creative solutions more than just brick and mortar. And that was a big thing that families and students and all of us talked about a lot over the course of the last year. And the last one is the communications with families.

    "text": " Flattery, flattery. I'm happy to talk through it. So for one, it's been really interesting to listen to y'all's thoughts. The accountability piece resonates with me. But for strengths, we had, especially at the high school level, clearly the strength is letting students have ownership. Students have ownership over their own learning and what they're accomplishing. They're transitioning to adulthood in college. You often don't even get feedback. So it's really important to be until the final. So it's really important to be cognizant of your own growth.  For wants, what would you want to see more of? We had some questions about what this is going to look like for the teacher workload. I think we wanted to be cognizant of not just shotgunning things that teachers do this, do this, do this, do this, what's going to make it better. And so how can we implement strategies to help teachers do this in a way that doesn't feel like just additional work or changes?  For opportunities, the biggest one that resonated with us is learning from the pandemic. It would be great if we can continue to use technology to assist with conferences. Having them via Zoom is a big benefit to a lot of families. Just having student work in general available with technology has been really helpful. I think both as parents, Dave and I both spoke about how it's been really nice this year to be able to check in on our students and our Duke conferences without having to go into the building.  So we'd like to see that continue. And then I think I skipped one up in the strengths was just that it constraining strengthening partnerships between actually parents and students and having an understanding of what your own child is doing in school I remember back when I was a teacher.  a lot of times I would actually, the parents would do most of the talking because they'd want, they'd have all these questions about what was happening. And so if you start facilitating those conversations where students are telling their own parents what they're doing and where it's actually really helpful, even outside of student conferences.",

So we're excited to now turn to provide an overview of our model for summer programming with students. We really do see this as the launch of our learning recovery work. As such, our goal is that our model for programming aligns to the principles of our learning recovery model. So again, we're committed to a focus on equity, the whole child,  personalized learning and relationships. With careful consideration of the types of learning and social activities that students have missed most and the toll that virtual and hybrid instruction has taken on our families and community, we've expanded and enhanced our summer program for students. One of the most exciting aspects of this expansion is partnering with community organizations and businesses to make high quality programming available to our elementary and middle school students.  and to support our families with a full day, full week program for our students. Knowing that many students missed out on the interactions of in-person summer activities in 2020, and that in-person time with peers was limited this school year, we prioritize making a full week of programming available for all elementary and middle school students. We will run this programming for the entire month of July and invite those students who have significant academic intervention needs to attend for all four weeks. At the high school level,  Our goal is to help students who have fallen behind in course credits. We know that the virtual environment has been a challenge for some, and so we're moving to an in-person credit recovery approach. High school students will get personalized support with their teachers. To help us in our planning for an expanded summer program, we surveyed families to gauge interest in participating in morning and afternoon programs. This was not a registration or formal commitment, but it did help us to plan strategically. We see high levels of interest in participating this summer.  And when asked about priorities, we see that our families share interest in supporting academic and SEL opportunities. It is interesting when we asked them that they could select other, I went back and asked Chris Gilman, what did they, I don't have any data on what the other was, because they all said all of the above. So anyone who said other was, they then wrote in all of the above. Beyond academics, families were able to weigh in on types of activities that they thought students would most enjoy the summer. Again, you can see the variety of topics, but also the inclusion of time with peers.  Here's a framework of what a student's schedule will look like. In the morning, ACPS staff will work with students on focused academic instruction and engaging problem-based learning that is creative and collaborative. In the afternoon, students have the option to remain at school and participate in engaging summer camp-like activities. To build out the afternoon programming, we completed a request for proposals through the procurement process. Because of the regulations of the RFP process, at this time we cannot share which organizations will be providing programming, but we will do so as soon as that process is complete.  However, we are so pleased with the response we got to our RFP from businesses and organizations within our community. We really value their willingness to partner with us. We'd like to dig into what we mean by focusing on problem-based learning with our students. This summer, we are excited that funding is allowing us to fully implement a nationally recognized program called Camp Invention. Working with the National Association of Inventors, Camp Invention is a hands-on STEM-based PBL program that supports students in critical and creative thinking.  Each student receives a comprehensive kit with all the materials they need to build not only a finished product, but also to build conceptual understandings and creative thinking skills. Teachers are able to use the program as a springboard for creating connections with traditional academic subjects, such as science, math, and literature. This video showcases the Camp Invention approach. If you'd like to learn more about this year's creative projects, I have pasted a link into them in the presentation notes. So I'm going to make sure I have my  audio on for screen sharing. And a quick note, this is an overview of Camp Invention. It was clearly filmed before the pandemic because kids are really close together and they're not wearing masks. But in the materials for this year, they do have mitigation practices in place. And actually each kid gets their own kit so that they can collaborate and work, but they have their own materials and all of our mitigation strategies can remain in place.",

Being able to provide a resource like this that comes with materials, that comes with projects, does help support our teachers. And we know that by asking for their support in coming to work with our students this summer, we want to make sure that we give them as much support as possible. A quick note on our model for the 9-12 program. Again, in the morning, a focus on credit recovery. We are also, though, creating a framework  that as fitting for older students, the activities outside the academic time will be driven by student interests. And so we've created a system for teachers to pitch fun activities they want to organize for students around interests. This builds on the robust club and extracurricular programs that we have in our high schools and also give some time for our teachers to have creative ways to re-engage with students in a personalized way.  So while we're excited about our plans for expanding summer programming, we do want to assure all of our stakeholders that we will be continuing to follow mitigation protocols to safeguard the health of students and staff. It was nostalgic, wasn't it, to see students all up in each other's spaces and sharing materials and whatnot, but we will have just as much fun being safe and socially distanced as well this summer. So what we would like to do is now to move back into breakout rooms to get some feedback on our summer programming model and plans.  After the breakout rooms, I'll let you guys do the turf war again about who wants to share out, but we just would like a little bit of feedback as we do the heavy lifting to get ready for summer.

And so we want to put first, put a lot of effort into getting those students into the building in a small group environment with really focused work on getting that credit recovery complete.

So if there's a student who only comes for one week,  they'll have a completed module. If there's a student who comes for three weeks, they'll still have completed modules.

So a credit that they don't have that they need to complete a course that they don't fall behind for graduation. In the elementary and middle schools, we have within our response to intervention program,  students who are in a tier two intervention, meaning that beyond their core courses, they are receiving intervention supports in order to help them make up academic, need academic gains. And so those students are already identified within our program, and then their school counselors and their assistant principals would work with the families to encourage them to participate this summer. And I think one of the things that is always having, you know, talk to students and families as a building administrator,  One of the things that's really important is the emphasis on a creative summer programming to attract students in. So parents are excited, right? Like my kids need to come to school and this is gonna be great, but there has to be that attraction. I think if we have, summer intervention does not sound like a great way to spend your July if you're a 12 year old who hasn't been successful in school.

So a huge strength for us was just the accessibility for everyone. And that is unprecedented and really good. But we did have a question, and this sort of straddled, as you can see, all of the  all the different areas, is that, you know, we still have students, a big chunk of students who are choosing to stay virtual now. And I assume that, you know, I don't know what would change for them in the next month and a half, two months, time has lost meaning to me, but when summer starts. So, you know, what opportunities will we have for students who stay virtual, especially when we're talking about, you know, credit recovery,  being in person. So I think that's a really key component to that. One of our wants are sort of tied up together. And this is actually just something that I generally would like to see. And I know that the video was an example of one thing that we're using.  But I haven't yet seen the evidence that project based learning problem based learning, the things that are PBL and change every few years that that moves the needle for students with the achievement gap.  That's just sort of a global thing that I would like to see. But especially, you know, as we're choosing summer programs to make sure that they're equitable, and to make sure that they actually have been shown to be equitable, and to move the needle for us on that, since we need to do that.  We also have accessibility for everyone as an opportunity that we need to seize on. I mean, like obviously we're seizing on a pretty unique funding opportunity here. Let's see some of the themes. One of the themes is the opportunity for students to sort of get back to normal and for that to include some fun, you know, the split in the day, give some of that, and then also the availability to everyone.

So for me, the strength, I just love that. I would want to go to this summer school program. And that's not something that I think  Often it's something people say, well, gee, I want to go to school in the summer. I certainly wouldn't have wanted to. Opportunities, the most obvious one is that we have the potential for in-person instruction, additional reading time, focusing on math and reading. One of the strengths, the opportunities that I think we have is, I think that as a matter of,  eventuality, our country is going to have to go to year-round schools. The reality is we're the only country in the world that still has summer break like we have. We know that there is an academic slide every single year. And so this is an opportunity to show our kids, to show our parents, to show our staff that, look, this could be a really good thing that maybe helps us to transition.  One of the concerns that we have is that all of our kids have suffered through the pandemic. All of them have suffered setbacks academically. We know they have. But it's not necessarily going to be reflected in their academic performance. And so I hope that we don't lose  side of the fact that all of our kids are going to be needing assistance, even if it doesn't reflect that on their grades or their test scores.  We want to, our wants are we want to make it manageable for parents so that working parents can actually drop off and pick up their kids. And we also as group two.

And all of the principals in each of the schools I was in said that everybody's cooperating. The only thing they have to really deal with with masks is when it slips down below the nose. Just remind them and up it goes.  And so, and it's just great. I did promise Scottsville Elementary that I would give a wave to them tonight. Hi, Scottsville. And that's all I got. OK.",

All right, I did go to an Earth Day sort of event in a way at Monticello High School, we remember probably about two years ago, Mr Stanek brought us some honey from the bees that he had at Monticello.  Unfortunately, some of that, the hive, I think, died out. So there'll be no honey this year, but Ms. Binder and Mr. Stanek were sort of setting up new bee colonies, or at least trying to entice bees to come into the area to lay eggs and sort of produce new hives. So being there for Earth Day was really a nice occasion at Monticello.",

They both placed first in their categories in the Science Fair. And I hope that Phil is able to get them to come on with us for a spotlight.  on education. I think that would be a very, very interesting couple of subjects. And also to the boys team and the girls team for cross country at Western winning, in the case of the boys, the state title for the fourth year in a row, and the girls for winning it for the first time in a row. I'm not sure how many times they've won it,  and for the two runners in each category and each boys team and the girls team who led the way for those teams. Way to go.",
