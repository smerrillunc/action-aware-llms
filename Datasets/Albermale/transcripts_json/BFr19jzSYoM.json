This afternoon, we're calling it the stages of returning. I'm gonna start off as a reminder of our key milestones with the board these last two months.  We began with the guidance document. You made a decision to postpone the start date. And then on July 9th, we presented scheduled scenarios for hybrid learning. Those scenarios maximize in-person instruction under the social distancing constraints of buildings and buses. And so this afternoon will be about deciding the opening plan. As we shared at the last meeting, the state has issued phased guidance for schools.  This guidance is intended to be the ceiling, not the floor. The scenarios on the ninth aligned with the phase three of this guidance, and this afternoon we will share stages and options that more align with phase one and two of this document. While the state is currently in phase three, it is strongly worded that the final decision is in the hands of the local school board. The board must take into account your local health conditions and your community concerns.  So the purpose of today is that Dr. Haas will make a recommendation to the board and then the board will select a starting stage for Albemarle County Public Schools, what we're recommending for the first nine weeks. Again, this is the start of our school year.  To achieve that purpose, we're going to start by reviewing feedback that we've received since the last meeting. We'll go over what we're calling the stages of returning. Dr. Haas will present his recommendation, and then we as staff will step back, allow you to discuss and decide your action, and then we'll wrap up with next steps. So first, feedback. I'm going to start off with feedback. We'll review in detail the staff survey and parent intent forms, but I also wanted to highlight  the other avenues that we've received feedback in the last several weeks. Dr. Haas has hosted employee and family forums, excuse me, with randomly selected individuals. As he mentioned, the school board, you have hosted three town halls. Staff has met with a teacher feedback group and leadership groups. And as we're all aware, we've seen many, many, received and read many, many emails. So Dr. Kaiser will go over our staff survey.",

The survey ran from July 10th through July 22nd.  And as you can see, we had 1,262 respondents. That is out of our total of about 2,700 employees. The responses included 871 teachers or licensed staff, with the rest being our classified staff. As you can see from the results here, when you look at their comfort with returning for face-to-face instruction,  There is considerable concern, about 65% of our employees are saying that they do not feel comfortable at this time returning to school, face-to-face that is. When we break it down into the different aspects that may be on their mind that are worrying them, you'll see that there are a number of things that if you look at the weighted scores, they're very very similar, but we have a number of employees that are  somewhat or very concerned regarding physical distancing, addressing illness at the school, getting sick themselves, exposing their family, leave options, what our protective protocols will be, and also our cleaning protocols. And just for other information for you to have at this time, at this moment Human Resources has received requests for telework or virtual teaching.  from 51 of our staff members. One of the things that we know is the CDC has identified certain high-risk groups that we have found that the people who are requesting these, many of them fall into those categories. We also are hearing from people who have concerns for family members that they live with or that they're caretakers for that may have high risks themselves. And also we have people who have made these requests who are just  generally fearful for or concerned about coming back to face-to-face instruction. At this time we have had leave of absence requests for the full year for 10 of our teachers and 5 of our classified staff. That's somewhat on par with last year where we had a total of 15 leave of absences for the entire year. And at this moment in time we have 6 teachers who have not yet signed their contract and have specifically indicated that that is due to their concerns around COVID and are awaiting the school board's decision for how we start our instruction.  to make their determination. One of the things that we do know is that these numbers will shift as we as the board makes decisions about the in-person instruction.",

I think it's important to note that regardless of the outcome today, we will continue to gather this data from our families. It's important for planning purposes.  And we just encourage families to remain in contact with their school to update responses as more information is provided over the next several weeks or their personal circumstances change. So this afternoon, I just want to highlight two questions from that form. The first is the amount or the current level of concern. And so we had over almost 6,000 responses to this question as of today.  And as you can see, with the weighted score of 3.44, it indicates responses are primarily between somewhat and moderately concerned, with almost a third being extremely concerned. And if you recall, these forms were sent out one per student, so a household with three children had three different forms to fill out. The second question we want to highlight is the preference of hybrid versus virtual learning. At this point in time,  2,286 of our families have selected a virtual learning option for their child. So again, that's 226 students in front of our families. A similar survey a month ago, that was only about a thousand. So I'll hand this over now to Ms. Collins to go over the stages of returning.

    "text": "We are presenting a staged approach to returning to school.  These stages were developed after listening to feedback from our stakeholders. There are three key points to consider as we move through our presentation. These stages presented are a sequenced approach from fully virtual instruction to fully in-person instruction. Public health will be the guide for the decisions that the board now, Multnomah County Public Schools makes on how and when students will learn. And ACPS will need to be fluid in their response to the community, depending on public health.  Before we discuss the stages, we want to emphasize that we will always be looking to our healthy environments. In all stages, all employees will have physical access to the learning space and equipment and resources. Health mitigation strategies will be in place for all students and employees who would enter the building. And more information on those strategies can be found on the website under Return to School. We have developed five stages.  You can see from this slide that there is complexity to each stage and the progression from one stage to another. Within the stages are strands, a virtual strand, an access strand, a hybrid learning strand. As you move from left to right, student numbers shift for all students being in a virtual environment and experience to most students being in an in-person experience.  We'd like to offer three definitions that we believe will assist in unpacking and understanding these stages. Virtual learning. Virtual learning is a learning experience that is enhanced through the utilization of computers and the internet. The instruction most commonly takes place in an online environment and can be synchronous or asynchronous. In-person access. We define that as students will be invited into the building so they can do their virtual learning in the building.  These students will be arranged in small pod groups of 10 or fewer. Pods will be provided a learning coach who will assist with the virtual experience as prescribed by the students' teachers. Transportation would be provided. Hybrid learning. Hybrid learning is a learning experience that is a combination of in-person instruction and virtual learning. And again, in this model, transportation will be provided. Stage one.  All students will learn virtually. Stage 2. A key feature of Stage 2 is to provide access to three groups of students. We have identified these students as likely to have extreme difficulty accessing the curriculum through virtual learning. Elmhurst County Public Schools will offer optional in-person access to buildings to a limited number of students, including  Students without internet access or limited access we cannot improve. Students with special needs who cannot access the curriculum virtually as determined by their IEP and English learners in grades four through 12 with WIDA levels one and two. Dr. Diggs will give you more information on our students with limited or no internet access.",

    "text": " Thank you, Ms. Collins. Good afternoon. I'm Christine Diggs, Chief Technology Officer, and I'm pleased to be here to share our plans for helping as many students as possible get connected to the internet. It's important to know that for virtual synchronous instruction, having an internet connection capable of streaming video and audio for a sustained period of time is essential. We know how many students we have with no internet.  And the parent intent forms will let us know which students we have limited access and which students have limited access that we are unable to improve. The Department of Technology will support our schools working with their students and families on a case-by-case basis to determine the connectivity solution each student needs based on their location or financial need. There are three possible scenarios for students without internet access that are shown here on the slide.  Based on the scenario for the student, we can provide these following solutions. For no internet or access that we are unable to improve, the family will have the option to choose between students coming into their school for the virtual alert to do their virtual learning work, provided we are at that phase where they can be in the building, or receiving paper packets and flash drives. For students who can utilize a hotspot successfully for their connection,  will provide one or more if needed with an unlimited data plan, which is critical for streaming video. And then for students who do not currently have internet access due to financial situations and to reside in the service area and qualify according to Comcast's criteria, our schools will assist those families in applying for Comcast's Internet Essentials Program for broadband connectivity, and we will pay for it. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hello, I'm Kevin Kirst, your Executive Director of Special Education and Student Services, and I'd like to provide some clarity with regard to exactly how we're going to handle, in Stage 2, students with special needs.  It's important by default to recognize that in Stage 2, students with disabilities that have IEPs or Section 504 plans, the regular ed, the general ed environment would be redefined as virtual. So that's the default. So when there's questions just in general, what are we going to do with students with disabilities, it's what we're going to do with  their general ed peers, and that is we're redefining in stage two the regular ed environment. We plan to implement IEPs that were written in the spring of 2020. Of course, they'll be reviewed for any exceptions that absolutely cannot be implemented, but for the most part, it's expected that those would be implemented.  Only for students with disabilities who could not receive any meaningful educational benefit in the virtual environment would the invitation through the IEP process be proposed to include in-person learning in stage two. Specifically, we are talking about students with the most intensive needs. And just by the years of our work together, we've really  developed programs and models that can help us identify those students, and they are noted here. That is primarily students that are being taught with the aligned standards of learning and program models that we refer to as C-based, functional skills, community-based instruction, or post-high programs. The only addition to that  would be our A-based programs that use evidence-based practices for students that exhibit characteristics of, although are not necessarily diagnosed with autism. So again, this in-person access would be offered, but the family has the option to choose virtual should they do so.  And right now, honestly, not having a solid number, we're estimating 100 students, but that's our best estimate at this time.",

I'm Michelle Kastner, Director of Elementary, ESOL, and World Languages, and I'm pleased to be here to share our plan  for our English learners. For stage two, we specifically are thinking about English learners with WIDA levels one and two in grades four through 12. A WIDA level one student is a student who's brand new to the English language. And a WIDA level two is an emergent bilingual. And what we know from research is that English learners who have not reached English proficiency by fourth grade  find it really challenging to master the curriculum. English learners must acquire language and content simultaneously, and the content really increases in rigor in fourth grade. And of course, direct instruction is crucial for level one and level twos. And also, it's important that they acquire the academic language needed to access the content.  And of course, this in-person access is optional and students can remain at home if a family chooses.",

    "text": "Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Castro. Stage three. In stage three, most students will continue to be virtual learners. We will increase access to the building and to special ed services for all our English learners, our special education students,  and any student that we have identified at this point is not engaging in the virtual learning. In this stage, we begin to bring students into our hybrid learning model. We believe our youngest learners are the ones who will not thrive as well in a virtual environment, pre-K through three. In the past, you've seen the research on learning to read by grade three, as well as the COVID slide information for our youngest learners. We believe that we must bring  these students to in-person learning as soon as we safely can. The key feature in stage four is the continuation of bringing students into the building to participate in hybrid learning. In this stage, grades four through 12 will attend classes in the building. If you recall, we spent our early meetings in July unpacking this stage.  Just a reminder slide for the hybrid model. We believe that we are able to offer in-person learning based on transportation request for elementary students to attend four days per week and secondary students to attend either one or two days per week. In stage five, all students can receive in-person instruction in a more typical attendance schedule and operational practices.  As noted before, there will continue to be a virtual option for parents and students. As I stated earlier, these stages were developed by listening to feedback from our stakeholders. After developing the concept of progressive stages, we sought feedback on both the concept of stages and the factors to determine the progression from one stage to another. Dr. Kaiser will share more details about the feedback we received  on the stages and on their progression.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ms. Collins. Earlier this week, we spoke with about 175 teachers from across the school division and had the opportunity to put the stages in front of them and ask them some questions to gain their insight. The feedback trends that we heard from them included in the positives that this progression seems very logical, that there's a logical sequence to it.  There is consideration of risk factors and student need. They really like the idea of the gradual re-entry of students. And they also appreciated the fact that the staff would have access to the classroom and the resources of the schools. The other thing that they appreciated was the opportunity for re-evaluation each quarter.  to determine what the next stage would be. They did have some concerns. Some of those concerns that they brought forth was just recognizing that we need to make sure that we are providing very clear, very specific communication to our families and our staff.  There are concerns about the logistics of physical space as more and more students enter the buildings and we recognize the social distancing needs that exist there. We also recognize that there need to be very clearly defined parameters as we move from one stage to the next and we also need to make sure that the needs of our most at-risk students are met  and recognize that there is risk to staff and students throughout any of the in-person stages. One of the things that they did say across the board pretty loudly and clearly was once regardless of the stage that we begin at just having the decision for where to begin would be really helpful in the planning as we get ready to start the school year.  We also put this in front of our executive leadership team, which includes our principals and our department heads and what they they echoed many of the trends that we heard from the teachers and in the things that I would just share from them.  They want to make sure that we are ensuring that our community, our students, and our staff are safe as we think about the return to in-person learning. They also recognize the importance of serving our most at-risk learners, and they appreciate that the phasing allows us to kind of grow as a school as we move from one stage to the next. And they also feel that this plan allows for developing teacher capacity as the stages evolve.  We do know that how students are in school definitely impacts the teaching staff and the support staff as well. And in each of the stages, the number of people who will be doing, who have the ability to do in-person teaching versus virtual teaching is going to shift and change. So you can see on the continuum here that when we begin in stage one, all of our teachers are virtually teaching or teaching virtually, I should say.  And as we move through the stages, more and more teachers come into the buildings to physically work with our students. We will be able to keep some teachers teaching in that virtual manner throughout the entire continuum based on the students whose families request that they are in a virtual learning module model throughout.  We also know that there is impact to our support staff. And when I talk about our support staff I'm talking about our building services child nutrition and transportation amongst other support such as our teaching assistants and others who support the work that we do. One of the things that we know is this this group if we look at Stage 1 is very much negatively impacted by their regular work because they would when we don't have students in the building their their the work as they know it may not exist.  We are looking at the potentials for modified work schedule, telework, and alternate work schedules for all of our support staff in this model. There is a possibility for reduction in all of their hours. As we move through each of the stages, though, there will still be the need for probably some modified work and alternate work, but as we move from one stage to the next, you will see the number of employees who will then be able to move more towards their regular work schedule.  and doing the things that they are regularly doing. Our department heads of our support services are working together to brainstorm ways that we could possibly use our employees in cross-functional ways to best support the needs of our students until we are at the point where they are all being able to work their full work schedules.",

    "text": " I will now speak to how the progressions of stages will work. So first, the board will select a starting stage for the first nine-week grading period. That starting stage does not have to be stage one. The shifts and stages would then be made at the nine-week mark, unless it is necessary to move to a lower stage, which could occur immediately. Halfway through the grading period, the superintendent will make a recommendation to the board as to whether or not the school division can go forward based on numerous factors.  One of the most significant factors we know will be the health of our community. So I will give three slides to review how we are looking at that. First, I want to share an excerpt from the Regional Emergency Operations Center's weekly phase scorecard. The EOC is a joint operation with the city, the county, and UVA.  They have eight different metrics, but I want to call your attention to the first two. We want to see a downward trend over 14 days of percent positive tests in new cases. As you can see in the scorecard for this week, that metric is not met in our region at this point. The second snapshot I want to provide is a relatively new one. It was based on a newly released dashboard from the Virginia Department of Health that is accessible at this point only to public health officials.  We saw it for the first time on Tuesday and then met with Dr. Bonds yesterday on it. Again, we are looking at cases and percent positivity.  In this case, we're looking for what they call a case incident rate per 100,000. So that is a seven day moving average of the daily number of cases per 100,000 of population. So right now in Elmhurst County, that is 10.1. And our goal would be that that would be less than 10. And then our goal would not only that be less than 10, but it would be decreasing. And at this point, it's increasing.  What is the test percent positivity? That is, again, a goal of less than 10%. Right now, we're meeting that goal, and we also want to see that trending downward. It is trending downward, but just as of recent. We want to see that trend going a little longer. I do want to caveat the test percent positivity is a good point of data to look at, but there is some limitations because often testing strategy can inform that. So, for instance,  If you have a large-scale community testing event, a lot of people being tested that have no chance of being exposed or no symptoms. And so that can artificially decrease that positivity rate. And the last comment I want to make on our current COVID-19 conditions in the Albemarle region is around testing.  is of concern, access to testing remains limited, and those that are tested are seeing much longer delays in the results. And so we know a key strategy of keeping our students and staff safe will be to identify cases quickly, isolate and quarantine quickly, and our current testing situation will not allow that. So with that background, I wanna present our recommendations for what factors would determine the progression between stages.  They include health guidance, ordinances, public health data, our ability to resource and staff, and feedback. I'll comment on each, the current state of each, and whether they support in-person instruction or not at this point in time. So first, CDC guidance right now does support in-person instruction as long as mitigation strategies are in place.  Second, there are no executive orders or local ordinances that would prevent us from providing the hybrid instruction model that Ms. Collins presented. While the data that informed the recent Board of Supervisors action is of concern, the ordinance itself does not apply to schools. Third, the current COVID conditions in the region as referenced in earlier slides, COVID is in our community. We are not a hotspot like other parts of the country, but the increasing trend is of concern  and the impact of UVA students in a month is a great unknown. Next, as I mentioned, we have serious concerns about testing. As evidenced by our staff data, our ability to staff in-person instruction with staff that feel confident about their safety is not adequate at this point. And lastly, feedback.  Feedback has been numerous but varied. We know that many, many are eager to return, but many, many are terrified about their safety. So with that, I will hand it over to Dr. Haas to present his recommendation.",

    "text": "Thank you very much, Rosalyn. I am recommending stage two for reopening Albemarle County Public Schools on September the 8th.  This will have most of our students beginning the new year with virtual instruction. There will be provisions for students who do not have internet access or whose internet access is not adequate to come into the schools. Some students with special needs and some who are English language learners also will be able to come into schools to work with learning coaches in accessing virtual instructional assignments. The safety  of students, families, and staff together with a commitment to equity and quality in instruction we provide to students this fall are the standards I am using in making my recommendation. Whichever stage the school board chooses today, the decision will apply to the first nine weeks of our new school year from September 8th through November the 7th.  Halfway through the first quarter, I will make a recommendation to the board for the model we will use for the nine weeks beginning November 8th. Under stage two, we would be expecting between 1,000 and 1,500 students would be in our schools in September. That's about 10% of our students. So that would be about 90% that would be learning virtually. These students will be supported by teachers who volunteer  to serve, and the students who choose to come to school will also be volunteers. In both cases, we will be completely transparent with staff and families, as we have been throughout this process. I repeat, in Stage 2, all of the students and staff who choose to attend will do so voluntarily.",

The virtual instruction we will be providing in September will significantly differ from that offered in the spring.  Schools were closed by the governor on Friday, March 13th, with virtual instruction taking effect on Monday, March 16th. At that time, the State Department of Education directed all school divisions that all virtual instruction be based upon a review of previously covered material. And we didn't transition into new material until after spring break. Unlike the spring, we now have the benefit of many lessons learned.  and of extensive planning time for our educators that will include professional development on virtual strategies and techniques. Many of our educators, I would say all of them, are excited about what new things they've learned and what they can try with their classes in a virtual environment. Instruction will include specific class schedules for students, engaging and meaningful content,  and an emphasis on meaningful assessments of student performance and progress. In addition to providing students with the option of coming into their school to complete online assignments, families will be able to have assignments delivered to them at home in a paper format or in a recorded video.  The division also can provide hotspot devices to homes to connect them to local Wi-Fi providers. It also is possible that families without adequate internet service or with financial needs could participate in a Comcast program that would provide broadband services where available. Our school division would pay for the reduced cost of this service.  Principals will be in touch with families to provide information about their child's schedule and to answer questions that they may have. For those students who will be using school transportation to come into the school, bus route information will be provided in the parent portal by late August, or they can call their child's school if they're unable to access the parent portal.  We will continue to closely work with our local health department in monitoring COVID-19 cases and the community spread of this illness and will notify everyone as soon as possible about any changes to our operational plans. While I will make a recommendation to the board as to which stage to go into each nine weeks, I will also have the authority  to move the school system backward in stages without board action so that we can respond to swift changes in our local health data. The thousands, and I mean thousands, of ideas, suggestions, and questions we receive from our parents and employees and from our students has been extraordinarily helpful. For the most up-to-date information on community and employee resources around COVID-19,  The division's cleaning and disinfectant procedures and even updated information on our heating, ventilation, and air conditioning models are all available on our webpage, on our return to school page. Again, my recommendation to the board is to start on September the 8th in stage two. And I'm making that recommendation out of concern for the safety and well-being of our students  employees and families, as well as the quality and equity with which we can provide learning opportunities for all students.

So whether it be whole group, half a group, small groups, individualized, I think all that's on the table. And that's what the teachers are working on right now, is how we're very cognizant of the,  the barriers for young children. They need to be using their hands to learn. They need to be learning concepts. And that happens in a social interaction, in a social environment. And this constraint of virtual learning is such a barrier for some of that. Absolutely, we recognize all that. And the teachers are working really hard to figure out how to do that. So we would do synchronous if that's helpful. We also will record sessions. I think our teachers,  are very willing to think, had elementary principals the other day say, you know, we've been thinking about, could you offer something in the evenings that would be more helpful to parents? So maybe three of the third grade teachers do it during the day and one third grade teacher does it in the afternoon or evening.

We also know that as unemployment numbers increase, that tends to bode well for our substitute pool as well.

And we do have some policies or some procedures in place for what we'll do when either a staff member or a student gets sick. We have the flow of what will happen if somebody develops symptoms while at school, as well as a separate  flow for what will happen if someone gets diagnosed outside of school. And in either case, it will involve contacting the health department and working with them to identify close contacts. So that's the contact tracing that you've heard about. And they said that we probably will not have to include the whole class as contacts if they are in fixed seating  six feet apart, we can just probably do the kids who are, if it's fixed seating, the ones that are just directly around that student. And those students or staff members who are identified as close contacts will be asked to quarantine, stay at home for 14 days and monitor for symptoms. Does that answer the question?",

    "text": "I guess I can start off. I don't mind starting off. First, I just want to say thank you to everyone who gave input. I read through, actually last night, I tried to go through a bunch of them again, only made it up to the start of July. I read through the hundreds of the emails. I was appreciative of the over 1,000 people that attended the virtual town halls. I went and looked through the survey results.  And I appreciated the thousands of people who filled out the survey results. I even appreciate the one person who sent me snail mail, always enjoy getting mail in my mailbox. And thank you to the staff who worked so tirelessly to basically craft a solution that is responsive to so many different stakeholders. And there's in a situation that's there really is no great solution, to be honest. My vote would be for option two.  The stories that have resonated with me personally are the teachers who have written and the parents who have written us about the students that we cannot reach effectively with virtual learning. It's the ESOL teacher, former teacher of the year, who said that 40% of his students did not log on a single time in their 11th graders. My mom's an ESOL high school teacher, and she's actually way prepared for virtual learning because as an underpaid teacher, perhaps, she teaches online to students in China.  So she has a whole room in her house dedicated with like a green screen lighting. And I remember a very heartfelt discussion she had with me in the spring that she was worried that half of her students just disappeared. She was worried they would never come back. And I honestly don't know if they will. I think the same thing with their special education students. I think of the 10% of the people on the survey that said that on the electronic survey, he said they don't have adequate internet to keep up with the virtual learning. And I think of the moms groups I'm in,  in the parenting groups I'm in, where parents are scrambling, scrambling to figure out ways around this, homeschooling, forming pods, getting, hiring tutors, hiring teachers, hiring nannies to somehow implement this and make it work for their family. I think of the parents who wrote us and said they're gonna be putting their kids in private schools, which are remaining open. And then I think of all the people that don't have those resources. We're the resource. We have a $200 million budget  We have hundreds of thousands of square footage of space. If we can't make it so that we, it would be unfeasible to me to say that we cannot safely educate even a single student. Every student matters. So even if it's only getting in the 50 students that are about to drop out because we're not offering them an adequate learning environment, I would rather be able to offer, I think we can safely offer something to them. And that is not saying that our most vulnerable  And our most high risk students get to be guinea pigs and they get to get exposed to the risk. First of all, option two is completely voluntary. But I think we can do it safely. I really think we can do it safely. And even if it's only the most high risk, most high need students, we at the very least need to be stage two. And to be completely frank, I personally would be comfortable with a stage three. But I think the will of the community is important and my read of the situation and our employers, I think stage two is a good place to start and go from there.  I tried to talk fast, which probably made that worse, but I didn't want to take up all your time.",

Um, we've received literally thousands of emails and every one of them has a perspective that matters. I mean, it's just, you know, it's sort of, I mean, we have people saying absolutely open the schools immediately. We have people saying, don't open the schools ever and  They all have good basis for their positions. I mean, this is a this is a tough, tough situation. So I just want to say I really appreciate all the work staff has put into this. And I really do, because, I mean, it is. I think the level of the level of effort that has gone in is kind of amazing.  I am sort of in between a one and a two. All things being equal, I would be in one because I am a fairly risk-averse person. But I think we do have to listen to the voices of our teachers.  who are saying they're going to lose some of the students who are English language learners, and our parents and our teachers of special education. And I've spoken to a number of them who've said, look, my child's not going to be able to do this at home. And I said this once before, but I'll reiterate it. I think that there's an argument to be made for all of our students  that if they want it and their family wants it, that we ought to be prepared to give people a red shirt year. That they can redo the year because this pandemic will not last forever. We will get through this and past it. And it may simply be that some of the children don't receive everything they need this year. I think we need to be prepared as a board  to give that offer to the family to say, hey, look, if you didn't get third grade, there is no stigma in any way, shape, or form to say, hey, you know what? Let's redo third grade and make sure you get everything you need before we advance you. But all that being said, I trust Dr. Haas. I trust his staff. Dr. Haas is recommending that we start it too. I absolutely have faith in him that he'll do that correctly and that  If we need to, you know, my big concern is that when UVA reopens in about three weeks after the kids get here, we might have a real problem as a community. And I believe Dr. Haas's assurance is that if, hey, if the numbers go south, we close immediately. And with that provision, I will be supporting the motion.",

You know, I think that,  We don't want to deprive our kids who could benefit from stage two from at least nine weeks of instruction provided in the manner in which they need to receive it. I mean, that doesn't need to happen. If we move, as Dr. Haas was saying, if we open in stage two, he can move immediately to stage one if we need to.  but we can't turn the other direction and go up the scale, meaning in larger numbers stages without at least four and a half weeks worth of notice. But the one thing that really does it for me on stage two is it doesn't include mandatory attendance. And that's a big issue as regards to the students and the parents.  and the teachers all knowing that they can opt out in stage two if they absolutely need to. And this is the primary difference in my mind between stages one and stage two. It was an interesting thing that I got curious as to how many years of experience went into the making of this plan.  And so I learned that the work of Dr. Haas, his cabinet, as well as the principals and directors throughout the school division, their cumulative years of experience within Albemarle County Public Schools is 1,418 years. And about 300 less fewer years of that are in administration.  So there's a lot of experience that went into the decision making. And these are people who have the best interest of our students, our teachers, our staff members, and all of these people's families in the fronts of their minds at all times. I will vote for stage two. And that being said, I know that this isn't an easy one for any of our board members. It certainly wasn't for me.  I will work tirelessly and will support any decision that's made here by the board this afternoon. Thanks.",

But our decision is how do we balance  the health risks to our 14,000 students and our 2,700 employees. So we have a slightly different job than individual families do. I think based on the fact that option two provides some access to some of our most vulnerable, it's all voluntary.  And we do have an immediate option of reverting to the earlier stage.

I don't know if there's a waking moment that I'm not thinking about it, to be honest with you. And I respect all that, and I support a stage one opening. I don't feel like there's any reason to believe we're any safer today than we were when we went into shutdown. We're actually regularly seeing much higher numbers of new cases in our health district than we have at any point during this pandemic, especially since July 4th, and that hasn't abated.  The data that Rosalyn presented also makes me feel like we're not ready to have students in our schools. Now, I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into the stages, because I do think that that's a great way to bring students in. But right now, I don't think that we're in. We're ready to be in stage two. I also don't think that we have any reason to believe it's going to get any better in our health district.  The cohort that we have with the second highest number of cases is the 20 to 29-year-old age group. And we're going to get a lot more when UVA opens. And so that's just with UVA closed. And then we're going to get a lot more of them when it opens. And we have many community members who work there. It's not just the students who are affected by that. So I'm not given to believe that there's going to be less risk  than there was when we shut down. There are also, I'm still very troubled by a lot of unknowns about this disease. And all these things are not things that we, you know, are in control of. And I'm not, I'm not blaming anyone for them. I'm not saying like we had a bad plan. I'm just saying we have a good plan with different stages. And I don't think we're ready for stage two.  There are a lot of unknowns about the disease. There just was a study, like someone sent me a one o'clock today about how kids carry a higher load of the virus. That's in the New York Times today from like 12 p.m. So, but we do also know that students 10 and up pass the virus along just as quickly as adults do, which is very,",

But we also need flexibility.  We need flexibility so that each week we can look at the dashboard and make a determination as to whether or not we need to make a change. So each week from now, we will check in. The Virginia Department of Health has now developed a school division specific dashboard that they shared with the Virginia Department of Education on Monday, which was shared with us on Tuesday. It's embargoed. It's not, it's only shared with  local health department officials, so we have to contact to get that information, but it will give us great detailed information about our locality that we can add to our dashboard. And you all, I mean, just like anything else, you have my promise that we will update you on where we stand with that. And if we need to, as we go into September 8th, we can drop back from stage two  to stage one if things are starting to move more quickly in a wrong direction. They're already in a wrong direction, and that's why we recommended stage two. And then I just would emphasize again that students and staff coming in on stage two would be doing so voluntarily. Thank you.",

    "text": "Yeah, I would like to elaborate on the point. I appreciate if it's a split vote. I think it's indicative of a decision that's really hard. It'd almost be weird to have a unanimous vote, I think, on something that has no clear answer.  But I do want to point out because I'm sensitive to the fact that I do not believe stage two is inequitable to our high risk students. In fact, it feels kind of paternalistic to take the choice away from them and to tell them what is best for those communities, especially when I feel like they've been missing from the conversation. And so  What I would say, I remember reading the Seville Weekly, where one of the leaders of our local preschool coalition suggested that what we need to do instead of sending the school is perhaps they could get teachers and have a community effort to educate those children and go out to their neighborhoods. And my question is, why can't we also help those students? Why can't we have that same level of flexibility where we allow them, where we can think of ways? Judy, you said, how do we serve them? And that's the question. Why can't we be involved in that?  And so for stage two, I would never want to imply that I'm willing to take, put them at risk. What I am willing to say is I think it can be done safely because it's absolutely a difference between sending all of our students back and sending only a very small number of our highest needs students back. And I wanna have the flexibility to offer them the services that they need. So.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ms. Carlson.  Any other comments from the board? The only thing that I have to add into what's already been said is that probably somewhere deep down, it should be rational, I guess to me, to completely understand and to completely accept what Kate and Katrina and Johnno and Dr. Haas are saying. I agree with all of you somewhere deep, deep down inside completely.  But maybe the main issue that I have is that there are so many unknown factors, quite a few of them that Judy brought up, quite a few of them that Ellen brought up. And those unknown factors, to me, are so great until I'm not really ready to accept that we start out at stage two. I received, and I think all of us received, and I hope we all read them, two emails that really sort of moved me.  And one of them wouldn't really be affecting what's going on with this. One was from a second grade teacher. And she was sort of asking, first she described what her normal classroom would be like. She'd have tables and other activities for all of the little kids to be around. They'd all be sharing materials. They'd all be hugging each other. She'd be hugging them. But then she raised the question about once this  recognizing everything that we don't know about COVID and recognizing all of the problems. She mentioned what would she do to tell those little kids and to explain to them that they can't hug each other anymore, that she can't hug them, that if they have their shoe untied, she can't go over and tie their shoes. If they are crying because something is going wrong, she can't hug them and sort of make things better.  But then the one that, to me, the email that was sort of probably the most thought provoking was one from somebody that said, what would you do if one teacher or one child died in the schools because of being exposed to COVID?  To me, that question was just so powerful. It just meant so much until I really couldn't give it an answer I'm not really sure how, what I would do, or how I'd react. I know that I'd be really deeply moved and just extremely sad that that happened. And I realized that everything that staff has done that we really can't.  stop that from happening, that that might be just something that would happen anyway. But given all of those factors, I really can't support starting out at stage two. I'd rather that we start out at stage one. And that's not casting any dispersions on Dr. Haas or anybody else on the board or central staff. But that's just my feelings at this point in time. Are there any other discussion points? If not, are we ready for a vote?  Okay, hearing nothing, silence gives consent. All right, Mrs. Johnston, could you give us a roll call, please?",

And it should be no secret because the Charlottesville staff all are gonna understand this, but we meet weekly with Charlottesville schools leadership staff and we met with them today  And while the newspaper report says that they're starting out all virtual, they are not starting out all virtual. They will be bringing in students in the same fashion that you had just voted to do in our stage two. They will be bringing in students who have gaps that need to be made up. And I think it's no secret too that my wife works for Charlottesville City Schools  She's already volunteered to go in to work with the students who need extra time and support because she prefers to go in to do that. And she's already been asked to do that. And so their schools will be open to these families, to these students that you just also voted to support. What was printed in the newspaper is misleading. I'm sure that's not the responsibility of the Charlottesville City Schools because  As we all know, when we give news reports and pass on information, however it gets interpreted by the news outlets, that's their own decision to do that.",

And I know each one of you  has wrestled with this because I've had conversations with each and every one of you. You have been incredibly diligent. Not a single board member has sat back and gone without questioning and asking very critical questions on behalf of the well-being of our students and employees and their families. And you have really done your diligence. So thank you very much for putting us through that.  We are here to serve you, and we're going to make sure that the plans that we carry out are going to support learning for all and safety for all.",
