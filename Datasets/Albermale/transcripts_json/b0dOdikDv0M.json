I will state for the record and the minutes of this meeting should so reflect that the meeting is being held electronically pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance because the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location.  The meeting is being streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website and public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting room feature in accordance with the school board's current protocol or by written submission. Before moving on, there are two other quick things that I wanna just make note of.  And that is a thank you to all members of the school board. We've had four meetings in this last two weeks. And normally in this month, we have two meetings. And we have two meetings next month instead of the normal one that we have in July. And I'm just very appreciative of that.  I also want to say that I'm very appreciative of Dr. Haas, his cabinet, and his staff for being as accommodating of us as they have been through these four meetings and before. They all have full-time jobs during the days.  and with a heck of a lot going on and moving on right now, but also moving forward through unchartered territories. So I thank you one and all for your work, your patience and your unswerving devotion to what it is that you do. I also wanna take a minute because I did not introduce another member of our  group last week. And that was, I think, because Allison Linney is like family to us. And so we all know her, but I realized that not everybody in the viewing public will know who she is. So Allison is the president and founder of Allison Partners, a consulting firm that's founded with the belief that people are at the core of an organization's success and is based here in Charlottesville.  Ms. Linney has an MBA from the Darden Graduate School of Business at the University of Virginia, and she has worked with government and academic agencies, large public and private healthcare systems, large multi-specialty groups, small group practices, HMOs, providers of healthcare information systems, and occupational medicine services, as well as free health clinics  And she has worked with us and been an important part of our processes over the last five years that I've been on the board. I'm not sure how long you were doing it before, Allison. She was selected as the 2018 Charlotte's fit. Come on. I'm going to do this. Nobody needs to know all this. One last thing, because this one's important too.  She was selected as a 2018 Charlottesville Regional Chamber of Commerce Small Business Person of the Year and serves on a variety of University of Virginia boards and community organizations. So Allison, we're very glad that you're here and now everybody knows who you are. And she's got a cool lightsaber.  So moving on with our first order of business, we need to approve our agenda. May I have a motion to approve the agenda?",

And in recent weeks, we've shared with you some updated version of our school calendars. And today, we'd like you to take action by selecting a start date for the 2020-2021 school year.  I'll begin with a quick reminder of our timeline. On June 18, we shared with you the results of our calendar survey, and also shared with you our return to school planning guide, which you spent some time unpacking on the 19th. This week and next, we've been meeting with principals and department leaders about possible scheduling scenarios for next year, and today we'll launch a survey for our families to provide feedback about their plans for next year.  Today, we'd like the board to vote in a start date for the 2020-2021 school year, and at our meeting on July 9th, staff will present an attendance schedule for the year. Based on a number of factors, including teachers' desire for additional preparation time, the results of our calendar survey, and the planning of our school schedules, which are beginning to come into greater focus, staff is recommending that we start school on Tuesday, September 8th.  It's important to note that this year's calendar will need to be somewhat fluid and will likely undergo additional modifications once a return to school scheduling plan has been adopted. For example- Did you stop your presentation?",

    "text": "Yep. Sorry. That's okay. For example, if students are not in school every day and we have a built-in planning and development days for teachers each week, we would not need to delineate these days as non-student days in the calendar like we have in the past.  Students would be accessing school on these days, and we would plan to count them as part of the 180 days of the school year. This would allow us to shift the final day of the school year to an earlier date. Should we enter a phase of recovery during the school year that allows all students to return to school in person, that could also have an impact on the calendar. However, our traditional school breaks, including Thanksgiving, winter, and spring break, would not be changed so that families can make plans for these holidays.  We also realized that each of the September date calendar, September start date calendars that we've shared with the board had the final school day where the Juneteenth holiday would be observed next year. We will not have school on this day for students or staff next year and believe our final day of school would likely be earlier that week with the modifications that we may make to the calendar.  Finally, I wanna let the board know that this week we met with the executive leadership team of the Charlottesville City Schools to share our thinking behind our return to school plan and our updated calendar drafts. We'll meet with them again in coming weeks to discuss the board's decision today as they plan for next year. So if there are any questions prior to taking action, I'll be happy to address them now.",

And I don't think as much as you can prepare for things, I think we're going to run into issues once we start up this. And so for me, the week  is kind of balancing the need to get kids in school and realize that we need them there soon and giving us time to work out some of the quirks while still providing a delayed start. And I think it's a little bit of an unfair categorization, Matt, to say that every segment's in favor of the September 8 start date. We got the data last weekend.  Everyone doesn't know. We don't even know what school is going to look like. Like people are taking that survey, not knowing that we're going to have an online component. So for me, I prefer September 2 because I want to get kids in. I'm appreciative of the fact we need a delay. That's what I think.",

And as you know, we entered a wonderful partnership with the Boys and Girls Club about a year and a half ago for them to build a 30,000 square foot facility on the Lambs Lane campus. Because of a variety of reasons, they ended up taking a much less favorable location to build that on.  And since that time, they have shared that the building costs are about $3.5 million more than they had originally contemplated. In addition, they went to the Board of Supervisors to get some help in covering that shortfall. And recently, the Board of Supervisors  said no, that given the revenue stream and budget constraints, they could not do so. So here today, in addition, there are many other advantages to building on the preferred site, which was on the driver's course.  in addition to disturbing less natural area, better drainage and a variety of things. But I would like us I would like to make a motion that we authorize our attorney, Ross Holden, to work with the Boys and Girls Club to move the site to their preferred location, which is currently on our driver's range.  and come back to us either on the 9th or at least by the 16th, understanding that everybody is in tight time constraints.",

And the data has shown that students that learn to drive in a parking lot with cones, that learn to drive on roads, have the same safety records. It's just as effective as using a driving range.

It can physically happen. But as you can see from the list of water drainage and clearing out hiking trails and clearing out woods.  It is a much less good sign.

Mr. Page and I sat on the committee to make that decision from the different vendors, and it was the right thing to do. It was not ideal, and it was not, I think,  No, I would say it was appreciated by the Boys and Girls Club. It was probably a frustration. And I know Mr. Pierce is watching this right now.

    "text": "I would just say I sent a message to Katrina because I said I really appreciated her analogy of the of the birds because I have  My expression I've been using with staff is that what we've been trying to do as a school system, which is something that I think you should always try to do, is if you can have more than one thing for students,  then you should always try to have more than one thing for students. So we have a driving range at Alamo High School that's been there for quite some time. At one time was a crown jewel. Members of the Board of Supervisors during that era, I believe it was constructed in the 60s, 70s, really saw that as quite a feather.  or a jewel in the crown of Albemarle County. In fact, I remember one time Dean Tisdat and I were waiting outside of a community meeting over at Jack Jewett one night and an elderly gentleman came, was coming up. Someone was helping him walk into the community meeting and he wanted to be walked over to look at the driving range because  He was so proud of it that during his era on the Board of Supervisors, he had brought state funding to have that driving range constructed. And I can imagine at one time it really was just a beautiful facility. The reality is it is one of two things that we could have for students. But if we've reached a point with the Boys and Girls Club where  They have they're experiencing a fiscal crunch, and they're not able to complete their facility, then I think that this is, again, my opinion as the person responsible for operating.  the school system, my opinion is that we should shift to the one thing, the one, uh, the one program that's going to be the most impactful, uh, for our youngest students, our most vulnerable students, and often our most marginalized students, because they could have an absolutely beautiful crown jewel of a facility that they could go to for their afterschool program, rather than staying at their  school and having to just do the same kind of things they've been doing with the Boys and Girls Club, which is a lot of, I mean, it's quality, but not as high quality as it could be if they were able to use their own facility, which I would add is also going to be able to be used by our school system when it's not being used by the Boys and Girls Club. And we'll be able to use it as a professional development space. We'll be able to hold meetings there and  I've also started a conversation with James Pierce, his staff, Dara Bonham, Ashby Johnson, and Steve Saunders and Jasmine Fernandez to start having a deep conversation about being more proactive and more community oriented with  our Hispanic students in that community, much like has been done in the Southwood community for the Monticello High School feeder pattern. Because here to four, we've not really had a very concerted and friendly leadership outreach to that community. And I see this facility as a real hotspot for that, to be able to help facilitate that and make that happen.  I am very sorry to see any facility be destroyed or to have another facility put on top of it. But my analogy around the birds is right now, we don't just have one bird. At one point, I felt like we had two birds in the hand and no birds in the bush. Now, I feel like we've  The only thing we're going to be left with is what we had with before is one bird in the hand that is really used by a relatively small minority of our students.  I'm sorry, I've had two students to go through the driver's education program. It's extremely high quality program. And I think they're excellent drivers because of it. I really do. We've got great instructors and Karen Waters Wicks does an amazing job. And she does an amazing job of oversight of all of the high school driver's education programs. So I, and I, this is no takeaway from Karen at all, but we have presented the board with data to show that there's no difference in outcomes.  for the students that use the driving range and those that don't. It serves a very small group of students. And my own children have said that of the several days that they spent in behind the wheel, just a fraction of that was spent in the driving range before they got out on the road because the instructor said, well, you're not going to learn to be a good driver on the road by driving in this range for very long. And I think that's true.  So I know I've just said a lot, but I was one of the people very early on that wanted to go through rigorous steps to make sure that there was a fair and open process to provide after school programming for our students. I feel like the Boys and Girls Club has met that. We have fiercely negotiated with them to have an agreement that's very favorable for the school system, and I think as well as them. And at this juncture,  I don't have a vote, but my preference would be to go with the program that's really going to serve our students that are young and vulnerable, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 learning loss, as Ms. Lee pointed out earlier. So those are my two cents. Thank you, Dr. Haas. Actually, more like a dollar. I'm sorry.",

    "text": "Yes, if it's appropriate. I would like to give my two cents as a representative of the driver's education program, as well the extended day enrichment program, both of which will be affected by this decision, if you all care to hear my position. Please. I would like to.  Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, I have not been a supporter of the program from the beginning, just because it has been one that I have observed with political influences.  That was in the best interest of an organization without strong consideration of what is in the best interest long term long term not short term, but long term for our students and families. So, you know,  Our objective as a school division is to improve the quality of life for all of our students. And so when we talk about a child care service that's inexpensive, it's like low or no cost for our low income families, what are we doing to address the core of the problem as to why they are low income families?  And it boils down to the fact that we have miseducated the parents of the children that we're trying to serve right now. So what are we doing in terms of asking the right questions to make sure that we're not continuing to increase the economic disparities that we have by creating another program? Sure, this program will provide childcare service. Then you have to ask the question, should Albemarle County Public Schools be committed to childcare services? Now, also when we,  We talk about replacing or relocating the driver's education range. We certainly should not make a decision today without determining the cost of a driver's education program and as to whether or not we can afford a new driver's education, replacing a driver's education program before we make this decision. So I think that we have to be very careful when we make these decisions.  simply because we're all about long term impact. And, you know, we are looking at a lot of mistakes that we've made historically, and sometimes we repeat decisions by just  considering how we made decisions in the past. Have we really thought about what we're trying to change in terms of serving some of our low-income families? Have we looked at how many of these children are latchkey kids, or whether or not their parents really need to service? So there are a lot of questions that were presented that were not asked. And I'm just encouraging you all not to jump into making a decision right away, such as removing our driver's education program, considering a new up-to-date  facility without understanding the cost, a deadline, and all of those things before we jump into this decision?",

    "text": "If I may, since Dr. Hairston is a member of my staff, I think that we have provided more than adequate data to the board to suggest that we absolutely do not need a driving range. There is no need to replace the driving range. I think that it would not be in the best interest of our taxpayers to move forward with a program that is not  the standard program throughout Virginia and is absolutely not necessary with the modern technology that is available in our cars today. Perhaps during a time when there wasn't any kind of safety measures in cars, including not a requirement to wear seatbelts when that driving range was built, we no longer need such a, actually kind of a primitive facility to be used to teach our students to drive.  say that capital dollars need to be spent in some other way. Dr. Hairston was part of the RFP process all the way through. We had him to be part of that. I think his voice has been heard loud and clear, well above all the data that absolutely suggests, not only suggests, but encourages us to have a high quality afterschool program right smack in the northern feeder pattern in the urban ring where we do not have one.  So also there was extensive data around the EDEP program to suggest that it does not serve our most needy children. It is a very expensive program and only recently have we begun to adopt measures to use a lottery for that program. And we were looking to expand enrollment in that program this year, but we can't do that because we don't have the funding to do that.  The Boys and Girls Club will be able to do that probably sooner than we will be able to, and they will, in my opinion, be much more welcoming and open to having those students than we have with our own program. I don't want to refute one of my staff members in a board meeting. However, we have put plenty of data in front of the board to show that that driving range is not necessary, but a high-quality afterschool program that's affordable for our children in the northern feeder pattern  is very essential. And again, as the superintendent, I would also say that Rosalind Schmidt did speak to Dr. Harrison about this change in facilities, I believe last week or the week before, so that he would have time to share that with his staff in the driver's ed program.",

    "text": "Good morning, all. My name is Jamie Gellner, division program evaluator.  So I'll just orient us to our timeline here. And that is that last week, the board made a motion to eliminate the daily presence of school resource officers. And Mr. Holden began drafting a resolution, which we'll look at today. I shared with you a drive, which I'll walk through right now, that has a whole bunch of data. And I'm gonna point out to you our student survey data, our principal anecdotal statements, and the EAB research.  And then Mr. Holden will go through the draft resolution. The next meeting, we can provide more information as requested. If you see things over the next week that you have questions or comments about or raises even new questions, you can send an email to me or Dr. McLaughlin and we'll get the answers for you. And then by July 16th, you may approve the draft resolution.  So here are all the files that I sent you yesterday. I apologize for the problems with the Google share, but I think we've got it figured out. And if you can't access it now, please let me know with an email. The folders have the principal statements in there. Our ACPS local climate surveys, the discipline crime and violence report, which is an annual report to the state.  I put in the related school board policies that may be pertinent to this conversation. There's two that are highlighted that specifically mentioned school resource officers. I put in the research brief from EAB, our independent research firm that we partner with. We've got our state climate surveys, the student survey, and late last night, Chris Gilman sent me the disaggregated results and a summary of the comments. So those are also in there, but they won't be in my slideshow.  Some information about threat assessments are in there. And also we put the draft MOU and the resolution that Mr. Holden drafted.  So for the student survey summary, this shares the link with you here if you want to click on it now. We had over 2,000 responses from our students, which is about a third of the student body that we surveyed. Of note on this slide is just that 40% say they rarely or never saw the SRO at their school, while 35% say they see them daily.  Here is a slide that shows the first question we asked was if they knew the role of the SRO. And then these are the questions that break out the things that our MOU state the role of the SRO is. And you can see the level of agreement or disagreement with their knowledge of each statement. These questions here,  are several of the ones that the board asked to add. A few of them we already had in there. And these you can see, if you look in the folder that I shared with you, all of these are disaggregated by the race and ethnicity question that we asked our students. So you can see the results in there. And I apologize for not having them in the slide. It just was kind of a late night change. For the last questions we asked students, have you had, have you or a friend had an interaction with an SRO?  And so they answered yes or no. And question 10, only the students who answered yes answered question 10 about the interaction itself. With our principal comments, seven of our secondary principals responded to the survey that I sent them. They were generally positive comments, and they were supportive of SROs in schools in some fashion, although many of them gave balanced support.  of the pros and the cons. Some of the positives that came up are that these SROs really do build relationships with students and families. It can be a positive first experience with an officer, and they do use their SRO as a resource in their school on various topics, whether it's law, a liaison with the ACPD, is what that should say, not ACPS, or on their threat assessment team. Things that need improvement  is that there has been some turnover and that can be hard for that relationship building. And there are families and students who are anxious when the school resource officer is around. And you can read all of their comments, their full comments in that drive that I shared with you.",

I prepared a resolution, not so much for you today to look at it and decide whether this is how you want to address the situation, but rather to provide some structure for your discussions today. We understand your position about the most recent MOU program.  and want to let you know that we certainly will consider and make our best recommendations for a different program for school security. So there's no magic to this. It's not meant to say this is what we want as a school division.  but rather to give you some food for thought. The most important thing, though, for us, for the superintendent and the cabinet, is that we have some direction to pursue. We've had an SRO program for decades. We don't have an off-the-shelf substitute program. That's gonna require some research, some discussion,  before we can bring back to you recommendations or at least options for you to consider hopefully in the near future. But we do need some time to do that. And this is what this resolution is meant to do, to have the board provide guidance to the superintendent on what we should be looking into. Some of the ideas we had, for instance, are the use to which the draft MOU  that has not been even completed yet with the county, but which addresses many of the issues about which you could express concern. And that is making sure that law enforcement does not intrude on the rights and authority of the school division to handle its own disciplinary matters. The draft MOU also states the goals that  Ms. Gelmer was kind enough to put on the screen, and that is to make sure that all children feel safe and secure so that they can thrive in the school system. But that said, we don't have any preconceived notions. These were some ideas that we thought we would put before you for your consideration, for your change, for your modification.  But at the end of your discussions, what we're asking for is a resolution that will guide our actions going forward to make sure that we are able to come back to you with ideas, with options, with recommendations for your consideration to have some type of school security in the ACPS. I will tell you, one thing that you need to know when you have these discussions is that  The state of Virginia, by law, does not require SRO programs. However, if a school division decides that it does want an SRO program, it must follow the model that's put out by DCJS. Now, I wish I could have given you that today as part of your package, and we'll get that to you as soon as possible. However, the website has had technical difficulties for over a week,  has announced that they've had technical difficulties for over a week and that we are unable to access that. However, to give you a good idea of what it looks like, the draft MOU which you have in your possession does follow that. It goes beyond the MOU. It covers everything that the DCGS model has  But it goes further to delineate the responsibilities clearly between the school division and the police department so that law enforcement and school disciplinary matters are clearly separated. And also to provide some additional, I don't know if responsibilities is the right word, but that the SROs in the schools would have  different roles to play, not just to bring students into the law enforcement arena. In fact, one of the major goals of the draft MOU is to, as much as possible, keep students out of the law enforcement chain and allow the school to resolve its behavioral issues on its own without intervention of law enforcement.  But as I said, those are all ideas for your consideration. And what we would just really appreciate is some very concrete direction from you so that we can go forward and provide you with the information that we hope will allow you to develop a new program for security in our schools.",

It's not necessarily what I would have anticipated in terms of  the number of incidents per school and those sorts of things. I just found that some of those numbers are very odd. It strikes me that despite our intent that police officers not become involved in discipline, it seems to me that they must be because the largest number of incidents involve, and I'm breaking it out as the reports that were done, but defiance,  being inconsiderate, using profanity, all of which do not seem to me the kind of thing that an SRO would be the ideal person to deal with. A defiant student doesn't need a police officer. They need an administrator or a teacher dealing with that. And if the teacher can't deal with it, the administrators deal with that. I don't see where that rises to the level of an SRO.  I was concerned about the numbers at some of the schools. I mean, there's a disparity at the different schools. And so, I mean, I'm more troubled, to be honest with you, I'm more troubled by the SRO program now than I was before. I think the information actually makes me feel worse about it. I don't know how anybody else feels about it, but those numbers concerned me. I also wanted to say that I,  I'm not, and I. I like Judy's. I don't know if anybody else saw it yet. Judy wrote a, wrote a. An amendment that amended the resolution and sent it out this morning. That I think better expresses at least my motion from last week.

We provided that report as a state report that we send up each year that gives a total look at what each of our schools looks like in terms of suspensions for alcohol, disruptive behavior, infractions, things like that. Basically any infraction that goes into power school  as a discipline infraction is listed in the discipline crime and violence report, but there's no connection between those and school resource officers being involved with those incidents.

In Virginia, there are infractions at the school that are  that are actual criminal offenses that must be reported, just reported to the police department. So for example, if a student is found to be in possession of marijuana with intent to sell, like let's say a student shows up at school with a pound of pot,  and it's all packed up and ready to be sold, plus they've got $200 in their pocket and it's halfway through the day, then likely is that they've been selling marijuana at school. And at that point, we're not to investigate those criminal offenses. We have to, by law, reach out to the police department to have an officer come to the school to speak to the student. Those kinds of issues are  are relatively few and far between in Albemarle County schools. So I think that there are very few instances where there's something known as a school-based arrest. And that's not the case, I think, around the nation. I realize we're not talking about the rest of the country, but  I want, you know, and I only I'm only bringing this up because I want to be sure that the board understands that our, our local police department, the officers that work in the schools are not to and do not get involved with things like what we used to call defiance or disruption or  you know, disrespect or those kinds of things.",

We were just trying to accumulate information.  In fact, I'm glad you brought it up because other board members might have looked at it the same way. The other thing I'll say, and then I'll jump back again, is if the board would remember, Dr. King made a presentation to the board maybe a month ago or so where he was talking about new guidelines around student behavior management.  that Virginia Department of Education has published. And I think it's a relief to everyone. And I think if you remember, the Virginia Department of Education is abandoning discipline reporting codes that have to do with those, what we call discretionary offenses, such as disrespect.  or defiance or disruption of the classroom, those kinds of things, because they are the most disparate in terms of diverse students of color and language being punished for those things. When you look at the data all across the state and in Alamo County schools, black and brown students are most likely to have teacher referrals for  things that are very nebulous and rely a lot upon the individual judgment of the person involved, such as, quote unquote, defiance or disrespect. So Virginia is abandoning those reporting areas to go back to talk about things that, what's the result of it?  If, for example, whether you look at it as defiance or disrespect or whatever, if a student does something that impacts the school climate or impacts the classroom, I don't remember the categories right now, but we'll bring that report back to the board because it's very encouraging.  that Virginia is moving away from things that are so open to just individual biases creeping in about my inability or as a teacher to be culturally responsive and understand where all my students are coming from and how they express themselves. And suddenly I'm labeling a student as disrespectful or defiant and not taking the time to get to know what they need.  So I just wanted to share that. Do you all remember Dr. King making that presentation? Yeah, I was really excited about the whole thing because it's something that has needed to change for a long time in alignment with the things that we're trying to do too.",

It says different school security initiative because I think parents hear that we want to get rid of police or decrease daily presence of police and think that we're not going to be adequately  making sure that schools are secure. And that's just not true. There's lots of ways that you can have security in schools. I think Albemarle has even done, when I toured Albemarle, when Jesse was still the principal, someone mentioned that they had different securities, like he had higher security there. I'd reached out to some old colleagues of mine who are administrators now. One of them in Atlanta says they do use SROs. They don't keep them.  in the schools, they have a very clear delineated process for when they involve the police. So for like a weapons, if it's a gun, if they find a gun, then they have the police officer involved from the initial stages. But otherwise, they have a very clear checklist that you have to go to before you get to the SRO. And in many cases, he said that SRO is not involved at all until at the very end of the police officer will contact the victim of the crime and see after they've done the  behavioral therapist and all the other stuff, they'll contact the SROs and SRO will contact the victim to see if they want to press charges. So I'm just saying that there's, I don't want the, I like that we have that in there. And that's what the kind of thing I would like to see from the school system is not, we're not going to have this discipline. We're not, we don't care about student safety. It's that we don't, this can be done differently. And in a way that is, in a way that is effective.  That was a lot of talking. I hope that made sense.",

We just voted in the earlier part of this hour not to have students back in the buildings until September 8th. So we do have time to do a good job looking at all the background information and give the staff some time to pull together what resources or options we may want to make decisions on.  And secondly, having a later date would permit Nick King who directs that program to participate. And I think just that would be good to be able to question him and get his input on it as well.

So I just like to jump in and say that, you know, I realize we're still in the fact finding situation. I stand by the vote from last week. Okay, let me just say that right up front. I stand by the vote from last week.  I know Mr. Page at one point you had an interest in the in doing a parent survey. I don't know if you're still interested in doing that as part of the  As part of the program moving forward, I know the school division is ready to move forward when we give them solid direction. And I would agree that July the 9th is going to be too soon. And I regret that I'm probably not going to be part of that next conversation. I got a lot out of the student responses. And I saw that there were.  It was primarily the high schools that responded, which you would expect, with 64%. There were some groups that were overrepresented, the Asian population, the white population, and the Native American population. The representative one was African American population, the underrepresented one  or ones were, well, was the Hispanic population. Two that weren't broken out were disabilities and ESOL. And as I was going back and forth and reading that information, I realized that it would make more sense for me to just look at the disagree and the agree sections, as opposed to the neutral sections, because no matter which way you were looking at it,  if you move the neutral over with the disagree or neutral over with the agree, it totally skewed it because there were a lot who were neutral in that. I thought that was very interesting. I fully agree with Ms. Lee's statement from last week of we have to look at the national information, not just the local.  And I, but I also have to say that I think we have to look at the local and not just the national. So I think it's got to be a blend. And I think that's what we're trying to do. I had a conversation with a senior police official on Wednesday, and she, he told me  that the biggest concern that they had, if we're not, and I understand our motion is not to have a full-time presence. And I think we're all in favor. And please correct me if I'm wrong on this.  you know, that there would be situations in which the SROs could be on campus, whether it's being called or whether it's teaching, you know, being involved with, you know, as was described in the letters from the principals and from the students, that they, you know, sometimes teach. I know that's not the major part of their duty.  But the biggest concern was that if we are only going to have them on a call basis, you know, pick up the phone when we needed a police presence and we call 911, that means that we get the next person in the rotation in that area from the police. And that that person who will be responding to us  may or may not have ever worked in a school environment. And I think there was one example given in the principal's notes about when a, I think they called it a road cop, never heard that expression,  that showed up and it wasn't as good an experience as when SROs who had relationships with students, who had relationships with the principals were the ones who were dealing with situations. So the one thing that I would like to have us consider and perhaps have schools consider is to maintain some kind of a relationship  And I'm not saying full-time on campus, I'm not doing that at all, but with the SROs so that it's a known quantity when we need help. I don't know how to do this, but it's a known entity that comes onto the campus in the northern feeder pattern, the southern feeder pattern, the western feeder pattern.  And they've had experience working in schools. They've had experience working with principals. And I'm not suggesting that the road cop would not be somebody who's trained. I'm not suggesting that they wouldn't be trained in how to handle an emergency. But I think that our environments in our schools are different.  than many of the things that these folks would be used to seeing every day. And I think it would be to our benefit to somehow figure it out so that at least some, if not all of the SROs are the ones who would respond when they're needed.",

    "text": "You're correct. So there are five. And actually, at one time,  Right around the time I came to the county in 2004, there were more school resource officers than there are now because there was one in each high school and then there was also one in each middle school. And then during the recession, when the local government and the schools lost a significant amount of funding, the SRO program was reduced and it went down to three.  And then over time we added back one so that there would be a school resource officer to be at Murray High School and also kind of work at Burleigh kind of because they're close to each other. And then another one was added not too long ago to be another police officer at Albemarle High School because there are 2,000 students at Albemarle  as opposed to 1,000 at Monticello and at Western. And also, they wanted to be able to have a police officer that could kind of circulate among the elementary schools and middle schools in the Northern feeder pattern without not having one at Albemarle while that person was out and about if they needed to be. I think that for the elementary schools, the most times when police might come to an elementary school is when there's like a heads up  that there's going to be an upset parent that maybe has once a better custody arrangement and can't seem to get it. That's that's typically when I'll hear like you know that a police officer has an SRO has been deployed to go to one of the elementary schools is because a father or a mother or someone has said I'm coming to the school tomorrow and I'm going to take my child whether you stop try to stop me or not. That's typically like how that might come about. But to  to the point that several board members have made, there's not a, in fact, I think one of the things that Dr. Acuff was arguing for was a greater accounting of the police presence at the schools because while they are assigned to be at the high schools, they're often not there because they're in training or because they have other  uh, responsibilities that the police expect them to fulfill. Um, you know, they're not at the school every day. They're not, um, they're sometimes for a good part of the day because they've had to go to court or something like that. And I think one of the ways that, um, that you might rationalize that is because we, we pay for half of a police officer and the County pays for the other half. So,  they're just not going to be there 100% of the time. So that was another thing I think that was sort of holding up our negotiations back and forth with the police department was we wanted greater accounting for the time that the police were in the schools. So anyway, that's just a little bit of perspective.",

The one other comment that I did, I did want to make on the resolution that Judy did is I had a challenge with and happy to be shot down on this with the last paragraph, starting with resolve that the school board directs the superintendent.  and goes in to examine the draft SRO MOU that's been under negotiation, whether it provides a model for further consideration, explore other security, et cetera, et cetera, is I would like to have that in there because if we are going to develop and maintain a relationship with the police department, we've talked about this, I know before,  that there's going to need to be some memorandum of understanding so that the protocols for dealing with the different schools, the contact people, you know, the layouts and all of that. I somewhat resist abandoning the draft MOU, not because it should be, you know, implemented as is, but so that it could be a starting point  Because there's a lot of good content in there. And there's some things that need to be changed. There are some things that probably need to be omitted. Well, need to be omitted. But I just don't think we should abandon that. And that's what I'm interpreting this draft to say.",

I don't think this is saying we're not going to have a memorandum of understanding, just that we need to make, and Judy, maybe you don't want one, but  I like that it's crisp and it gives the direction that this is the end goal we want and that old MOU is not created with those goals in mind.

This is another area where it could be an exciting opportunity to have a board subcommittee where.  I see that Ms. Lee has a real passion for looking at the resolution and there might be another board member that also shares that. And the two of you could work directly with Ross to continue to influence his crafting of it before it's brought back to the board as a whole.  I'm not saying that has to happen, but there's lots of opportunities throughout the year where there's a particular issue that board members are really passionate about. And there's always the opportunity to form a subcommittee. But in this case, it feels like lots of board members feel comfortable weighing in and providing edits to it. And the last thing I'll say is that we do have several board meetings  So we have a COVID meeting next week, I think.

But the thing is, we're not asking what most people  experience are. We're focused on a small subset that's like the purpose. And I'm sure we're all aware of that. And I'm fine doing an additional survey.

Whenever we look at these surveys, and my staff is well aware that whenever we look at them, there are many limitations to surveying, and so I think  Looking at them as just one piece of a communication puzzle is really the best way to look at them. It's often helpful, but as I tell people, it's not a vote. It's just trying to gain a better perspective than what we might have just by hearing anecdotes.
