So what do you think of when I ask you about a potential pathway for an inducible protective response to excess glutamate that may be disrupted in ALS?  It could mean that someone left a medical dictionary open. For one of our students, however, it's a link to our nation's oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors, a competition that is now 79 years old. It's a competition that has produced the winners of 13 Nobel Prizes, 21 MacArthur Fellowships, and 11 National Medals of Science. I'm describing the Regeneron Science Talent Search,  and each year 300 high school students from across our country are chosen as national scholars. Regeneron, by the way, is a science and technology company headquartered in New York, specializing in delivering life-transforming medicines for serious diseases.  That takes us back to the question with which I began. One of this year's Regeneron's National Scholars is Rachel Field, a student in our Health and Medical Sciences Academy at Monticello High School.  For her achievement, Ms. Field earned not only a $2,500 award for herself, but also one for the Health and Medical Sciences Academy. Rachel's interest in medical research began while she was a Burley Middle School student and was introduced to our Health and Medical Sciences Academy. She was intrigued by its hands-on experimental approach to discovery  and its impressive success in placing students as interns with health care research firms and providers. Rachel also has a highly personal connection to Regeneron's mission. Both a family relative and a family friend have suffered from serious diseases. That exposure to serious illness led her  to her interest in studying possible pathways to improve the quality of life for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Her research, and Rachel will correct me if I'm not correct, but it started with the observation that many of these neurodegenerative diseases result from and are made more severe by the inability of a specific protein in the body to block the killing of certain kinds of cells.  So Rachel's research focused on how that protein could be activated to prevent this destruction and the progression of ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which we know more familiarly as Lou Gehrig's disease. Given that every 90 minutes someone contracts ALS and someone else dies from it, the significance of Rachel's findings hold the promise that someday,  its devastation can be reduced. So with that preamble, Rachel, please tell us about your research and this extraordinary opportunity as a Regeneron National Scholar. You have been given and the investment in our Health and Medical Sciences Academy. And what comes next for you? Hi, thank you so much.",

    "text": "Okay. So first of all, I'd like to take a moment to thank you all so much for having me here tonight. It really means so much to me that you're interested in my research and what it could possibly mean for biomedical science in the future. So thank you so much. Um, quick shout out to Regeneron for making this research possible, um, and the mentorship program of which I am a member.  So I will dive right in. And please feel free to ask questions. If they're in the chat, I may not see them. But before I leave, I will make an effort to answer each question to the best of my ability.  So as I'm sure we said in the preamble, my research study focuses on a neurodegenerative disease called ALS. So before I get into the specifics of what I looked at in my study, I'm going to give a little bit of a background on what ALS is. So it's also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. And as I said, it's an adult onset neurodegenerative disease that results in motor dysfunction and death. And it's a progressive motor neuron disease, which means that  over time, the motor neurons that are in your spinal cord right here in this diagram and also up here more towards your brain deteriorate and actually die over time. And as I said, it's progressive. So what happens is that this deterioration of motor neurons is not that severe at first. It's not that fast. So early symptoms of ALS include muscle weakness and stiffness, which aren't that painful, aren't that severe.  But over time, as the disease progresses, the deterioration of motor neurons gets more severe, a lot more rapid, and eventually that culminates in an ALS patient losing their ability to speak, eat, move, and breathe. And it is this last symptom, the loss of the ability to breathe, that often ends up in death of the patient by respiratory failure about three to five years from the onset of their symptoms. Now, ALS is fairly rare. It's estimated that two out of 100,000 people  are afflicted with this disease, but it is pretty severe. So it's a pretty big target in neurobiological research. Okay, so this is a part of the ALS pathology that the scientific community is certain exists. And that's, as I mentioned, the deterioration of motor neurons.  We can see here that this is a motor neuron in a patient that does not have ALS. We can see that it looks healthy. It looks plump. Everything seems to be functioning well. And then we look over here at the right side of the diagram, and we can see, even just looking at it without knowing anything, that this motor neuron does not look healthy. It's very skinny, and I think we can tell that it's not going to be that great at transmitting electrical signals.  So we know that this is definite in the ALS pathology, but what we don't know is exactly how our bodies end up leading to this deterioration of motor neurons. And there's a ton of different theorized causes for this. And all of these, or not all, many of these are listed in this right-hand side of the diagram. But my study focuses on one in particular called glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.  And we can see on the right-hand side of this slide that what happens in glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity is that there's too much of a certain molecule called glutamate that builds up in between the neurons in a person's spinal cord. And this excess amount of glutamate overexcites those neurons and causes them to die.  So that's a whole lot of background on ALS and excitotoxicity that provides the basis for my study. And now I'm going to jump into what I actually came up with for my findings. Okay, so in essence, these findings are a potential transcription activation pathway.  And we can see this in this upper right corner of the schematic shown right here. Basically, what a transcription activation pathway is, is a whole bunch of proteins that we can see right here.  AB, and there's a couple of other ones that interact in a very specific manner in a specific location on the genome, which is the DNA that all people have inside their cells that code every single process that happens in the body. So these specific proteins interact in a specific way on a specific part of the genome. And this whole interaction, the pathway, results in the activation of production of a certain protein, in this case, a protein that I'll call protein C.  So for my study, which was performed virtually due to the pandemic, I looked at a whole bunch of different online databases that provided data supporting different parts of this pathway. And then taking all of that data, I put everything together into one cohesive pathway that we can see here.  Okay, so in order for this pathway to happen, this putative pathway, it would mean that proteins A and B would both have to enter the nucleus shown right here, because the nucleus is where the DNA in our body is. And as I said before, all of those proteins need to interact on the DNA in order for this pathway to occur.  So theoretically, if these proteins A and B were not able to enter the nucleus, then they would not be able to participate in this putative pathway here. And again, theoretically, that could result in less of protein C being produced. So why does all of this matter? Scientific literature and data that I have collected over the course of my study suggest that in two different types of ALS, juvenile FUS-ALS and late-stage sporadic ALS,  this protein right here, protein B, is not able to enter the nucleus. And theoretically, this would mean that protein B would not be able to participate in this pathway, and less of protein C would be produced in these spinal cord astrocytes. Astrocytes are a very specific type of cell in the nervous system.  Okay, so again, why does this matter in the context of ALS? So these spinal cord astrocytes use this protein, protein C, to prevent that cell death process that I was explaining earlier called glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.  So in these ALS patients, theoretically, if protein B could not enter the nucleus and consequently not enough of protein C would be produced, then these spinal cord astrocytes would lose that safeguard against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. And excitotoxicity and the resulting motor neuron damage could possibly occur. And this excitotoxic cell death would exacerbate already occurring motor neuron damage in the spinal cords of ALS patients  and cause an increased speed and increased aggression of the motor neuron deterioration in these patients with late stage sporadic ALS and juvenile fuss ALS. So if my hypothesis is proven accurate by many, many experiments that I have high hopes to perform once COVID-19 is done, then it could provide a new target for mitigating the symptoms of ALS in these patients. And that could potentially prolong the lives of these patients.  which is the be all end all of anybody who's getting involved in biomedical research. Yeah, so I do have some example data that I could show at the end. But before I do so, I'll speak a little bit about the Regeneron Science Talent Search. I do have a slide for that. Let's see.  So it is a competition for high school seniors involved in math and science that is run by the Society for Science and it's sponsored by Regeneron, which is actually the company that I intern at. It used to be known as the Intel STS and the Westinghouse STS and the biggest component of this is your research study and the study that I just described is the one that I submitted for that.  There's also essays and a recommendation and your activities and a whole bunch of other things, but the research study is the center of your application. And out of about 1800 applicants from across the US and international high schools in countries like Puerto Rico and China, 300 scholars were chosen and they each received $2,000 for their own college education.  and $2,000 for STEM education at their school, as well as connections that will hopefully help myself and the other top 300 scholars further their research in the future. Yeah, so that is everything. I'm very excited about this. And again, I'm really grateful that you all put in the time to listen to my study. Yeah, that's it for me.",

And it has a relatively slow progression of symptoms. But juvenile FUS ALS usually has the first onset of symptoms when a person can be as young as about 18 to as old as about 30.

And in a virtual setting, it's very difficult to perform conventional research, so you have to be creative in how you collect your data.  So I relied on experiments that were published in other literature and also on a very wide variety of biomedical research databases, including protein expression databases, gene expression, protein-protein interaction maps, and a bunch of other ones. So looking at those databases and collecting data from those and from published experiments, I looked for data that supported isolated interactions of two  pieces in the entire pathway. So I looked for data that supported interaction between protein A and protein B, between protein A and that specific transcription activation binding site that you can see here labeled 583. I looked for data that supported an interaction between  protein A and the activation of protein C. And once I had evidence from experiments and literature and these online databases of each of the isolated parts of that pathway, I put it all together into one big cohesive pathway. So the challenge now is to see if those connections actually do exist or if it's just a very strong coincidence.",

    "text": " So I have an announcement, if I may, Mr. Page. All right. OK, thank you. I'm going to share my screen here. All right, let's see.  All right, here we go. So this month is Virginia School Boards Association Equity and Education Month, March of 2021. Equity and education is a significant challenge nationwide, and this is from the Virginia School Board Association. According to the National Center for Education Statistics,  In 2017, the majority of public school students were students of color, and more than half of public school students qualify for subsidized meals due to low family income. Public education has struggled to serve these students both adequately and equitably.  When inequity in education persists, there is a cost to all involved, including missed opportunities for economic development, greater dependence on government supports, and fewer Americans ready to serve and lead. To celebrate all the work that all of our employees are doing to support equity in Albemarle County Public Schools,  I'm sharing the stories of two of our employees that I consider to be equity leaders in our school system, especially after consulting with our Assistant Superintendent for Community Empowerment, Dr. Bernard Harrison. First, I want to celebrate Kaylin Gillian. She teaches her class annually about bias and persuasion very early in the class.  They explore how these two tactics spill into their everyday life from newscasts to advertisements. She connects for the students how lessons you learn in the classroom affect how you see the world. This is also how she introduces lessons on equity to her students as a diversity resource teacher at Jack Jewett Middle School.  She brings real life examples into the classroom. Most recently, she and her students discussed the COVID-19 pandemic and how it has impacted different students in different ways. And Kaylin does this by creating a culture of respect in her classroom. According to Kaylin, every student has a place in my classroom and every student has a voice. That's what it means to be culturally responsive.  Since becoming the school's diversity resource teacher last year, she created a group of student equity ambassadors called the Diversity Alliance. Most recently, the group planned a program for Black History Month over Zoom that was attended by about 60 people. Driven by their success, the group is planning an international day at Jewett to celebrate the different cultures of their fellow students.  But she also includes her colleagues in the fund. She created an equity team for teachers and staff, which started with five other teachers and now has grown to a group of 14. They look at various data from the school to identify disparities and strive to answer the question, how can we resolve them in the most equitable way possible?  At the end of the day, Caitlin's goal is to ensure that her students are ready to enter the world as well-rounded people and inform people. The kids are the future, she says, and if we want to create a better future, we have to empower the kids to see what is real. The second educator I'd like to highlight is Nancy McCullen.  After being with Albemarle County Public Schools for more than 20 years in a variety of positions from a classroom teacher to a novice teacher mentor and most recently principal at Red Hill Elementary, Nancy knows how an elementary school works and she's taken the knowledge and used it to sprinkle culturally responsive teaching strategies throughout her school.  With the help of two diversity resource teachers, the school has developed three programs to promote equity and diversity throughout the school.  The first is a book club for teachers most recently focused on Zaretta Hammond's culturally responsive teaching in the brain. The second is an effort to close a reading gap identified within the school. Nancy and her teachers have reviewed the books they are presenting to students to ensure that they are garnering student interests while at the same time presenting an array of different experiences and cultures.  The third strategy Nancy uses is called family and community partnerships, and this engages families and the community to share experiences and cultures with students. The partnership also works with the student council to brainstorm ideas on how to empower students through using their voices,  It's now so infused in all of the work that we're doing, it's hard to separate the DRT role specifically from the work that our whole school is doing,\" Nancy says. But like a true leader, it's the people around her who she truly lets shine through. I've been so grateful for the staff members who are participating in our book club. That group has made themselves very vulnerable with each other and then has been very open with their colleagues. So thank you very much, Mr. Page. I just wanted to share  a couple of our educators that exemplify the very best work that we're doing right now.",

I believe Dr. King came in once and he needed a way to spread this anonymous reporting app because it's there, but not many of the students are aware of it. And especially right now,  when students are not necessarily in school. So we came up with this short video. We didn't want it to be too cheesy, but also a little something that will stick in their heads. And hopefully this does that. And like Nyquil says, allow students not to take racism from anybody. And that's really what we did. And if you guys have any questions on the process or anything else,  I'd be happy to answer them.",

And so one thing that we need to continue to push out is providing enough specific information so that the administration will look at the anonymous comment and have  enough to investigate, such as an incident occurred in the cafeteria on a Tuesday morning at a specific time involving students A, B, and C, and then not include the name.

If there's a link to it, there could be an icon to it that just really links out to the web. And at this point, I believe it's available to just our secondary students.

Are there any other questions or comments for Angel?  OK, if not, tonight is Angel's final night to be with us. And we have a little statement here to sort of read on behalf of the board. Dear Angel, on the occasion of your concluding your service to our school division as our student representative to the Albemarle County School Board, I want to express the appreciation of every member of our board for the quality of your counsel.  I'd also like to quote from what you told us at a meeting on February the 25th and talking about school boards. You said you provide the conduit that delivers the community's values and will into its schools. It's not an exaggeration to say that decisions they make often have a greater long-term impact on our communities than those of any other elected body at any other level of government.  You brought these words to life when you helped to lead a community town hall examining the life-threatening risk of COVID-19, most especially the equal medical care and services provided to communities of color. The expert panel you brought together included state and local officials and a large online audience. Your role in that event and your leadership on the Student Equity Advisory Council ensured that you have indeed had a great impact on our communities.  Your discussion of structural racism, from the point of view of a student now widely shared across the division as part of our anti racism orientation for all employees did indeed deliver a community value into our schools.  Your willingness to offer insightful perspectives on such highly consequential decisions on the safest and most effective learning environments for students and staff proves the wisdom of student representation on our board. Repeatedly, you have contributed to the establishment of a direct link between ACPS students and the elected body that governs them, and for that we are all grateful.  There is no lack of definition for what makes a good leader. One of my favorites is that a good leader is thoughtful, inclusive, dependable, generous to others, and eager to provide them with opportunities to shine. It's exactly how you were described to us and how you will be described to the next organization fortunate to benefit from your service.  Thank you for making us better. Best wishes for a successful year at Albemarle. And to you and your family, please continue to stay safe. Respectively, Graham Page, Chair. Angel, we appreciate so much what you've done for us.",

The school board wishes to maintain appropriate meeting decorum so that persons can observe and hear the proceedings of the school board and that attendees online are not subject to inappropriate language and conduct.  As authorized by ordinance of the county of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments can be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all school board members for review.  And second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before comment starts, I will announce the order in which the speakers will comment. We have five speakers today, so I'll announce them all. Each speaker will be given three minutes to speak. I will notify you when you've reached a two-minute mark, so I'll let you know you have one minute left.  Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial district. Further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. Lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. Let me pull up the list. So we have Kristin Brockmeyer, Anita McNeil,  Ginty, Robin Matter, Emily Mathan, Anne Marie Park, and Gigi Florent. So Ms. Brockmeyer, if you are on.

I speak for the hundreds of families  who believe it is time to completely reopen our public schools. I want to speak directly to the board tonight. Misinterpretation of scientific data is resulting in policy that is harmful to our children, both academically and socially. In the beginning of the pandemic, there was much uncertainty. However, now, based on all the data available, we know for certain that keeping schools even partially closed  is unnecessary. And that's exactly what our board of the school board is doing in Albemarle County. And it's absolutely devastating for our community. Children are not high risk for COVID. Viral spread is minimal in schools with appropriate precautions. In a study of 4,876 K through 12 students and 654 staff members in a Wisconsin public school district last fall,  Even while their community had a positivity rate of 42%, there were only seven students and zero staff who contracted the virus. And this was with ventilation systems that hadn't been replaced, variable spacing in classrooms where they couldn't follow the six-foot guideline and chose not to follow the guideline, and no masks during recess. There's similar data and research from public school counties all around the country  in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Colorado, the list goes on and on. Suicide rates are rising exponentially as our adolescents struggle with feelings of depression and loneliness. I beg this board, and especially Mrs. Osborne, Mrs. Lee, and Mr. Page, please follow the science. Please look at the overwhelming data at a state and local level that shows how much our kids are suffering.  I ask that you commit now to providing families in Albemarle County the option to send their children K through 12 to school five days a week in the fall. Just like families can opt out, our families have a right to opt in. I realize there's no vote on the table today, but we as parents want to be heard. And I'm here speaking because we can't just assume schools are gonna reopen in the fall.  We need to know that our school board is certain they're going to reopen. We have to reopen. For the vast majority of children, we have overestimated the health benefits of keeping them home, and we have largely underestimated the cost. Thank you for letting me speak tonight.",

I lead two state partnership grants that serve children birth through third grade, including PALS.  I also have three children of school age, and I've had all my children in Albemarle County Public Schools for the majority of the last 10 years. I would like to put forth information that I would like you to consider as you are planning for the summer and for the next school year. We know from our state data that there has been a significant and negative impact on children from the school closures in the spring of 2020. We know it impacted children who are Black, Hispanic, English learners, and children from low-income families more negatively than other groups of children.  We know this is not the family or child's fault, but as evidence of systemic inequities and experience and opportunity for learning. Inequities that were exacerbated when the common thread of in-person school experience was removed. We know from national data and from our own state's data on enrollment that the current approach to schooling is not reaching or educating children equitably or adequately.  There is not room for anything but a decisive and aggressive plan of action. Business as usual mentalities or overconfidence in being prepared to meet the challenges will not be sufficient. It should be expected that a proportion of students will be more traumatized, disconnected, and vulnerable than ever before. It should be expected that the range of students' preparation for the next school year will be variable and wide, and educators will face challenges in the classroom that they have never, ever encountered.  There must be a strong commitment to applying the most effective approaches to education that are known and backed by research. These practices are best served by in-person education. The World Health Organization and the CDC point to numerous mitigation strategies to allow this to happen. These include masks, ventilation, handwashing and cleaning, testing, contact tracing, and social distancing. Of these, the most mixed science is behind six feet of distance, and the World Health Organization states that three feet is sufficient.  Work out of Harvard takes the same position. The British Medical Journal states that distance guidelines are not well backed. MIT says distance guidelines can vary based on other mitigation strategies. Plans should start with the goal of having students physically present in the school, says the American Pediatric Association. Around the country, school divisions are finding pathways forward through the science to aggressively prioritize students' daily in-person learning.  Fears and anxieties must be honored and met with outreach, education and facts, but not with a compromise to the system's commitment to children, nor by a failure to make a decision which will compromise the system's ability to address the educational challenges ahead.  The biggest risk is the disenfranchisement of students for whom public education was designed to serve. The systems level and long-term risk is that families disengage impacting funding and the quality of public education overall. The issue for me is personal and professional. I appreciate the chance to share my perspective.",

    "text": " Hello, good evening board members. My name is Robin Mattern. I'm in the Whitehall Magistrate. I have a ninth grader at Western and a seventh grader at Henley. I'm speaking tonight to voice my strong opinion that we need to commit and plan now to get all kids back to school five days a week in the fall. It is beyond concerning to me that we are hearing from our very own principals and other staff members that we will likely be hybrid in the fall. In fact, I would hope our kids may be back full time by the end of this year.  Come this fall, it should no longer be up to the seven of you to decide if my kids can go back to school five days a week. It should be my family's decision. All teachers and every adult in America will have had the option to have been vaccinated. Older kids may likely be vaccinated as well. The House and the Senate both overwhelmingly passed a bill on February 27th requiring schools to open five days a week with teachers present  starting July 1st. The governor is expected to sign the bill. The bill states every student should be offered five days of in-person learning. I have heard our district is investigating this to determine if it truly means five days in person or if there are other ways to interpret the bill. Why are we spending time and effort looking into ways to not implement this policy when it is the best interest of our students?  I realize we are abiding by the CDC guidelines of six feet apart in the school, which is why currently only 50% of our students can go to school at one time. However, that is only a guideline and many other reports have proven that with other mitigations, three feet apart is safe for children to be in school. This is how other schools have been open in our country and in our state five days a week since September.  In addition, it seems highly likely that the CDC will lessen these restrictions before the start of the school year, which should allow for full students to be in the classroom. We need to be planning for this now and assuming this is the go-to option. I urge you to do what is right for our kids and families and commit to getting our kids back to school five days a week next fall. Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "Good evening. My name is Emily Mathon and I am in the Rio district. And tonight I wanted to speak in regards to the proposed idea of school safety coaches to be integrated into the budget for the 2021-2022 school year.  I applaud the decision of the school board to remove SROs from the county schools. And I'm concerned that this new position is just the same thing, but in a different outfit. I hear about the anti-racism policy and a commitment to equity with the equity checklist. And even Dr. Haas speaking tonight about equity in education and having a culture of respect. So I'm curious how the creation of this new position has been evaluated by these tools.  I'd rather see the over $550,000 that's dedicated for this position to be spent on culturally relevant mental health services, history and social studies materials that tell a more complete and inclusive picture, restorative justice practices, and deeper and more complete anti-racism training for all teachers and direct service staff.  Creating safe school environments requires a much more holistic approach than creating a position. Safety is created when students feel like they belong, they feel like they are seen, they feel like they matter. Safety is created when academic content is relevant to their lives. Safety is created when students can learn from their mistakes and practice conflict resolution skills.  I urge you to fund initiatives that positively impact students and undo the harm that is perpetuated in our school system. Thank you.",

I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of continuing to expand in-person instruction to Albemarle students and moving toward the option for full-time in-person learning to every Albemarle student who wants it. This was a beautiful week, both outside and in schools, and children who have not seen the inside of a classroom for a year finally had those doors open to them, and we are celebrating that decision.  But I feel compelled tonight to speak for the many families who need more access to school and who demand assurances that this board provide the option for a full week of in-person instruction in the next school year. We should be fighting tooth and nail together to find ways to reopen schools. This board has tremendous resources available to you in terms of access to experts in the field of education policy and infectious diseases. Using these experts, I implore this board to rely on database decision-making,  to navigate these difficult choices. And there's no debate among experts that schools need to reopen as much as possible, as soon as possible, and that it can be done safely.  This Albemarle community supports the shared goal of reducing disparities in access and outcomes in education. But we only got farther from that goal when in-person learning was eliminated. Children and families were not affected by this shutdown equally. Some children are more vulnerable to the mental health impacts of this isolation. Some children cannot thrive educationally in a virtual environment. And some families are more vulnerable to the loss of the support system provided by schools.  We must provide principles of equity to achieve equality. And I ask this board, commit to parents that you will continue to expand access to in-person instruction to the children who need it to succeed. Thank you for your time.",

Next year, I will have a child at Western, Henley, and Merriweather. I wanted to echo the sentiments that some of the other parents have already shared, to hear that several principals in the county  have said in various forms that they are planning for hybrid learning in the fall is disheartening as a parent. I'm speaking today to urge you to take immediate action so that we are prepared to open the schools for five full days of in-person learning this fall. We need to start making plans now. The principals and teachers need the guidance and authority from you, the board, to start planning so they can make it happen.  The parents need guidance from you so that they can make informed decisions about how to plan for this fall so that we can avoid the academic, economic, and mental challenges that we have faced this last year. Given where we are with the vaccine options that are currently available and the options that are becoming available in the coming months, we need to anticipate having more relaxed guidelines from the CDC on their six-foot social distancing rules from schools.  They actually just published a study at the end of January that showed minimal in school spread with students wearing masks, not maintaining six feet of distance. As Anita commented earlier, this is corroborated by other research from leading epidemiologists and infectious disease doctors, as well as the World Health Organization, which shows that three feet of social distancing with masks is completely acceptable. School systems in Massachusetts,  Colorado, Texas, Ohio, Florida have either already opened five days a week in person or have committed to full-time in-person learning this fall. The scientific data is now there to support these decisions so that we can operate at full capacity. At this point, we have time to come up with solutions. We need to think outside of the box, figure out what additional resources that are needed, and we need to ask each other for help. I encourage you to send out  a poll to parents asking them what their intentions are for the fall. We can do better than what we have done for these children over the last year. We need all children elementary through high school doing full-day in-person learning five days a week starting this fall. We have to find a way. And if we don't, we will have done ourselves, our families, this community, and most importantly, these children's futures at the surface. I have confidence that you as a collective board  will help this community and find a solution to make the right decision. The science is there to support it, and we need answers sooner rather than later. This is a call to action, and I ask that you take a vote at the next meeting. Thank you.",

I am pleased to share with you the numbers this week. Albemarle County's seven day floating or moving average of number of new cases per 100,000 people  as of today is 11.2. Cases have been decreasing for the past 17 days, which exceeds the threshold of 14 days. So this is considered a decreasing trend.  The percent positivity of a seven-day floating or moving average has also continued to go down. The percent of COVID tests that were taken that were positive was now down to 2.1%. And this indicator has been falling for 20 days, which exceeds the threshold of 14 days. So this is also considered a decreasing trend. Similarly, in Charlottesville,  The numbers are continuing to fall the seven day moving average of number of cases per 100,000 people as of today is 11. This indicator has been falling for the past 19 days so this is officially considered a decreasing trend.  Similarly, the seven-day moving average of the percent of COVID tests that were positive in the city was down to 1.3%. This number has been falling for the past 20 days, and so it is also considered a decreasing trend. Perhaps not surprisingly, these numbers seem to be correlated with a precipitous drop in the number of UVA cases from a high of 229 on February 16th to numbers in the single digits this week.  Dr. McLaughlin will now talk to you about the core indicators and the level of impact on the schools.",

    "text": "Yeah, and board members, you'll notice tonight that our report here looks a little bit different. Recently, the CDC released revised guidance on what metrics should be used in determining the level of community transmission.  that we have in our area. The VDH reporting site began reporting those figures for individual cities and counties in Virginia this week. And as you'll see here, the CDC guidelines have shifted away from a 14-day reporting to a seven-day reporting to more accurately reflect the current state of community spread. And so we'll begin using these figures in our weekly COVID updates to the board.  What you can see here is they still use a core indicator of case incidence rate, but now it's a seven-day running average. That is currently at 131.5. One other thing you'll notice here is that the date is from March the 6th. These numbers are updated now instead of daily, once a week on Wednesday, and they use the numbers from the previous Saturday to report so they can account for the time it takes to get tests back.  You can see that we had this pretty large spike here a couple of weeks ago, and that's on a pretty significant downward trend. They're also using a seven-day average for percent positivity, and that has also come lower. Now, this graph here at the top in the CDC indicators, they say when you're using these two and they don't align with each other, you should go with the one that has the higher level of community spread to determine your community transmission.  level. And so you can see that we're at high. We've been stuck at that high level for quite a while, but it hasn't been forever in the pandemic. We've had several weeks where we're down at the substantial and several at the moderate. If you go back, here's pre-pandemic numbers right here. So these graphs, I think, help us kind of see the progression of where we are as we're determining our community transmission.  Now, one of the other things that's included in the steps we should be looking at in our guide to reopening decisions is to determine the level of school impact. And as you'll recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago, there's a couple of different ways to look at that. The first is transmission within our schools. And we are currently  at sporadic cases with no evidence of transmission in schools. Several weeks ago, we put ourselves in medium because we did have one outbreak down at one of our elementary schools, but that outbreak has ended and we have not had any more since then. Our student absenteeism rate is considered low as well. And if you'll recall, student absenteeism for these purposes is asking of the kids who are able to come back to school, are we seeing high rates of absenteeism from those  students. And finally, we have a staff capacity at normal. We're not strained or critical. So we consider our level of school impact.  at a low level. Now, the final step in reopening decisions is to take a look at both of those things, your level of impact to schools and your level of community transmission. And one of the things that just got updated this week from the Virginia Department of Education is this chart. You'll see that it provides more detail to what you should be considering at each level.  So again, we're at the high level of transmission for community transmission, we are at the low level of impact to schools. And so that puts us right here and we're pretty much our decisions have been pretty well aligned with that new guidelines. In this condition, we have pre K through 12 open to in person instruction to the maximum extent possible.  We ensure a minimum of three to six feet, ensuring a minimum of three to six feet of social distancing is strongly recommended and critically important and a minimum six feet distance for middle and high school students is also recommended.  extracurricular sports are recommended to be outdoor only at that time. Should these conditions shift, we could see us move into different levels of this, but I think the CDC and the VDH have done a nice job of helping us to look at those in a little bit more detail.  One final thing that we wanted to mention to the board, as we've mentioned a couple of times tonight, our stage four start began with a soft start these past couple of days with pre-K through three students starting up four days a week on Wednesday. Our fourth and our fifth graders also started school for the first time two days a week, as did our sixth and ninth graders. On Monday, we'll have our full stage four start, which is bringing back over 8,000 students for in-person learning.  to our schools. And so that concludes the COVID update for tonight. I'd be happy to take questions if there are any from the board.",

    "text": "All right, let me just get this up.  All right, board members, good evening again. I'm Pat McLaughlin, Chief of Strategic Planning, and I'm here to give you an update on the school division calendar for the 2021-2022 school year.  When we initially brought a calendar to the board in February, we did it knowing that as our learning recovery plan developed, that we may need to propose some calendar adjustments to the board. Specifically tonight, we're here proposing some changes to next year's school calendar so that we can ensure dedicated time each month for our teachers to engage in school and division level professional learning community work. As you know, professional learning communities or PLCs are a key driver for our continuous improvement in the division.  PLCs are generally comprised of groups of teachers who have similar instructional assignments and they meet together to plan curriculum, develop common assessments, analyze data from those assessments and other student work, and then make data-driven instructional decisions. This Plan-Do-Study-Act model places a focus on the individual needs of students and allows our teachers to learn from one another's expertise.  PLCs are also directly tied to our division priorities, particularly with respect to creating a culture of high expectations for all students and identifying and removing practices that perpetuate the achievement gap. One barrier that we've seen to maximizing the effectiveness of our PLCs is that it's proven difficult to find dedicated time during the school day when all members of a PLC are available to meet together.  However, one of the silver linings of our learning model during the pandemic has been the ability to provide that dedicated time during our asynchronous learning days on Fridays. This, coupled with our ability to meet remotely with colleagues, has allowed us to dedicate time not only to building level PLCs, but divisional level PLCs that bring teachers of the same content together across schools to learn from each other.  The work of analyzing formative assessments will be an increasingly important part of our learning recovery plan, particularly in light of recent legislation that has passed the General Assembly and is awaiting the governor's signature that will expand formative state assessments beginning next year. Teachers will need dedicated time to use these tools to analyze student work.  So to ensure this dedicated time, we're proposing to add five half days to the school calendar next year on these half days students would be in school as usual for the first part of the day, and be released early with asynchronous assignments to complete during the second half of the day. The second half of the day for our instructional staff would be dedicated to school and division PLC work.  When coupled with existing PD days already in the school calendar, this guarantees about one day a month of dedicated time for this work. A new draft of the 2021-2022 school calendar is attached to the board item for your review, and we plan to include the updated calendar on the April 1st consent agenda for action. I thank you for your consideration, and I'm happy to take any questions that you might have about the calendar.",

    "text": " I would just like to add that I really thank the board for taking this under consideration, realizing that you would not vote to approve the calendar until next week. As Dr. McLaughlin has mentioned, it is difficult and challenging to ask teachers to spend time analyzing formative assessment data to make critical decisions about providing extra time and support for students.  and also to make adjustments to their instruction without a regular cycle of time for them to meet and do that. I know that it's really difficult for, I would say, most of us to accept the fact that teachers actually do need time to do work outside of the classroom. We have squeezed our teachers over the years and asked them to do more and more.  including email. I know when I first became a teacher there was no such thing as email so I could have planning time and I could spend time meeting with other teachers and get things done. Our teachers are extremely challenged to find time just to do the basic things during their regular planning periods if they have them.  And so offering a half a day once a month for teachers to do this critical work and we did choose Wednesday for a reason so that it's in the middle of the week and it's not really kind of getting to Friday and then perhaps not having everyone in attendance or something of that nature. So I really I really beg the board on behalf of our  teachers to consider this time that will be very valuable to them. We do think it's minimal for what the challenges they do face in trying to help all of our students succeed. So I do appreciate you taking this under consideration. We can certainly make other adjustments to the calendar if you see fit.",

I guess my question would just be, is there something that we can do, to Ellen's point,  I'm worried about how much time our kids have been out. And so maybe it's extending a day or two of the calendar, I guess would be an option. Another thing that I, I guess I would have questions back because something about, cause you mentioned email. And I remember when I, when I was a teacher, which was a long time ago at this point, you know, we had a policy that we had to respond to every email from a parent within 24 hours. So I would push us. And I remember a comment from the, I think it was the E, the teacher rep who said that she wakes up and, and responds to email in the middle of the night.  That's a personal choice, but I hope we're also making clear to our teachers that.  you know, it's not a requirement that they engage in those ways where they're feeling overwhelmed and responding to text. And I mean, I get texts from my teachers all the time and they're more responsive than I am. And I hope, you know, there's ways that we can go about it, I want to say. And so I just want to clarify that it is not, I am not against teachers getting a half day. I think it's really important to have professional development. I think it improves the quality of education that they're giving our kids. I guess I'm just curious about, I don't want our calendar to reflect and say that we have the same exact instructional days if we do not. And, um,  And maybe we just don't have as many, and maybe we want to make it the same, which means we extend it somewhere.",

The reason we do that is because we've over the years have added five minutes here, five minutes there for changes with transportation and other facets of the school day so that we could meet the transportation needs, interestingly enough, because of the size of the county for us to be able to do that.

This is giving the teachers a chance to actually look at it. Because one of the complaints that I have, and I've had it for a very long time, is we take all these tests. We have all these evaluations. But there's never adequate time to reflect on them, to plan to address them. And what I understand the purpose of this is, look, we recognize that some of our students have gaps.  we're gonna be figuring that out. And as we figure it out, we need to give our teachers adequate time to plan to address the things that they have to fix. I am always very much in favor of people, I believe go slow to go fast. And this is one of those moments where I think we need to slow down and say, okay, look, I'd rather have 10 days of really focused,  well-planned education than 11 days of, well, we're trying.

We could  Typically, when we have half days, we work it out so that we offer EDEP on those days for students. So that's another option that we do. But we could certainly share what a half day typically looks like in terms of how bell schedules are adjusted so that the board would see that the high school students still have their classes meet and the middle school students do just the same classes, just not for the same length.  and then what kind of typical adjustments are made on a half day in elementary school.

And this evening, I'm here to facilitate the approval of your funding request. I just have a few quick items to review. Here is an updated list of the summary of all the revisions made since the draft funding request that we have reviewed together throughout our three work sessions during the season.  The funding request remains balanced with $12 million in new recurring revenues and $12 million in new recurring expenses. There have been no shifts on the revenue side, but simply some shifts within the expenditure side. This is a summary of our balanced funding requests of $209.8 million in both revenues and expenses.  After you all approve the funding request this evening, the next step in the process would be to present said funding request to the Board of Supervisors on Monday, which we have been working with you on. So that's pretty much it. I'm here to answer questions and entertain a discussion if you would like.",

I was at a panel a couple of weeks ago of 100 Black women of Black voices from students and educators. And one thing that was brought up was the student representative program for the boards. And the application, this was a point that was made by a student that the application has  is long and has as part of it, AP and honors classes. And I, you know, the student was making the point that that might be a barrier to some students and I recall, I think I recall that when initially we were talking about having a student representative we talked about trying to get  students from all, you know, all different kinds of students. So I just wanted to take a look at that, I guess, with the board's support, take a look and just see if there's if there are any barriers on our application and then come back with possible suggestions in the future.",

    "text": "Okay, so I just had three things. One is, and one it's related to the conversation earlier about commonality between Albemarle County Schools and local government. It is official now. We have talked with the Human Resources staff that we will be, Albemarle County Schools and local government will each be developing our own  human resources department. And so that will have an impact on many of the processes that we go through that are related to things like commonality and policy and other areas. I do want to say that I think that we have outstanding human resources staff that have done Herculean work to support two organizations that  are very large and complex and are embedded all throughout our community for all this time. And I really appreciate all of our human resources employees. I'm also looking forward to the future of our school system and our employees being served by a human resources department, or perhaps what I might prefer to call  an employee services department that works only with Albemarle County Schools. The second thing I want to say is that I really want to thank all of our employees for the amazing work that they're doing. By this time next week, we will have more than 8,000 of our students coming into our schools either four days per week or every other day.  That's about 65% of our student population. I am very appreciative of all of our educators, support staff, and administrators, whether you are focused on supporting our students and employees at school or offsite or both. I have heard great reports from our central staff who are out visiting schools to provide an extra hand as needed. And earlier this week, I myself got out to visit Greer and Mountain View.  on Wednesday and there was plenty of school opening excitement. Teachers and support staff quickly got down to business of high quality teaching and learning and I really appreciate that. One conversation I did have with a few students at Greer was this was their second time going out to get new clothes for school because they had outgrown the clothes that they planned on wearing the first day of school back in the fall.  And one student pointed out to me that he had outgrown his clothes more than the student next to him, which was what I expected. The last thing I would say is that I really appreciate, and I know the, I hope, I certainly know I speak for all of us, that we all appreciate receiving public comment about big decisions that our school board makes.  And these are not easy decisions and they're very important. And I for one greatly appreciate the deliberative nature of our board that you have always asked for facts, that you take what I consider to be a fair amount of time in making decisions and you ask lots and lots of questions and great questions to get to the best answers with the best information that we have.  I would propose, I'm suggesting and proposing that we could bring a, if we called a special meeting on Thursday, May the 6th, and I'll check my calendar, that we could bring a recommendation to the board on that Thursday regarding how we would plan to open our schools in the fall.  I think at that time it will be about six weeks from now, six work weeks. We will have gotten a good feel for how things are going in stage four. We will be making the recommendation based on reaching out to our families and understanding how many of them would be planning on coming in. And that would impact then how much space we would have in the school and therefore we would give it our best shot  to describe for the board and describe for the community what the school day would look like. So it would be based on the best information we could provide May 6th. And then as you have done in the past, the board then would have a week to think about it, ask questions and dig deep and then make a decision if you choose to on the following Thursday. So I wanted to put that out to the board and  and also to Mr. Page for your consideration.",
