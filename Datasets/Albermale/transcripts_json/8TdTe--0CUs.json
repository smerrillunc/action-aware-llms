Mr. Kennard, Ms. England, Mr. Crutchfield, and Mr. Saunders, all here. I hope I didn't overlook anyone. But this is the governor's proclamation, where school principals work cooperatively to direct, develop, and inspire all members of the school staff and student body, and to communicate effectively with parents to engage them in the learning process.  And whereas principals serve as educational leaders responsible for managing the policies, regulations and procedures necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students in Virginia's public and private schools.  And whereas principals and teachers are entrusted with the opportunity and the responsibility of guiding, directing, nurturing, mentoring, and imparting knowledge to our children while they are at school. And whereas principals must work collaboratively with teachers, staff, students, parents, and the community at large to proactively prepare students to be self-reliant and productive citizens.  and whereas Virginia School Principals Appreciation Week is an opportunity to recognize the hard work of Virginia schools principals and to recognize the importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a quality education. Now, therefore, I, Ralph S. Northam,  do hereby recognize January the 8th through 14th, 2022 as Virginia School Principal Appreciation Week in our Commonwealth of Virginia. And I call this observance to the attention of all of our citizens. So we do congratulate and extend our appreciation to all of our principals.

Tonight, we are truly honored to have with us Mrs. Lucille Smith, who recently completed unforgettable and extensive history of Jackson P. Burleigh High School.  Last year, the school was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In her preface, Ms. Smith wrote, Black History Matters. We must continue to document and preserve the rich and brave story of African-American students in Charlottesville City and Atmau County. Before readers open the book's first pages, Ms. Smith advises them that the interviews from students, faculty, and administrators are raw, candid, and from the heart.  Her connections to segregated education includes her husband Rizal, who graduated from Burleigh High School in 1966. Rizal later served as chair of the Charlottesville City School Board. Ms. Smith grew up and attended school in North Little Rock, Arkansas, across the river from Little Rock Central High School, a place forever known for its role in bringing into national public consciousness the struggle for racial educational opportunity.  unforgettable, the history of Burleigh is not a volume though about separate and unequal education in our community. It is instead a joyous celebration of remarkable young men and women whose time at Burleigh comes back in pages filled with personal reflections, copies of original documents and photos, and a long list of extraordinary achievements.  It recounts a story that should be told again and again of how education teaches us perseverance, pride, and confidence, friendship, and the value of just plain hard work, and how together all of these gifts build strong families and careers and selfless and uplifting community service.  Although she did not have the opportunity to attend Burleigh, the considerable talents of Ms. Smith as a historian and writer would convince you otherwise. She served for more than 30 years with the U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Center. She now devotes much of her time as a volunteer to local boards and community organizations and to her church.  I understand that our school division will be making copies of Unforgettable available to all of our schools, to all of our school libraries. I'd like to formally introduce you to Lucille Smith and ask our guest to share with us some thoughts about her important contribution to learning for all students in our school division. Miss Smith, welcome.",

    "text": "Good evening and thank you Chairman Page for the introduction.  Mr Jeremiah, thank you for the opportunity to speak about Unforgettable Jackson Peak Early High School. Dr Haas and Dr Dunn.  were very kind in allowing me to visit the county office building and go through old school board meeting minutes, which really assisted me with my research. I began volunteering with the Burley Varsity Club in 2011, and I became very intrigued with Burley High School. And I kept hinting, this great history needs to be documented. It did not happen.  So I took the challenge and I decided to write the book because it has been more than 70 plus years since the school opened in 1951 and there has not been a publication or an official history written about the school. And many of the students  No, all of the students are now senior citizens, and many of them are no longer with us. And the book tells some of the history of the school. There's just so much that you could write about. And there's the three area high schools. There's a highlight of those, Jefferson High School in the city and Albemarle Training School and Esmond High School in the county that united to become Jackson v. Burleigh High School.  There are wonderful interviews from students, faculty, and administrators. And what was so important to me is that there is a picture of every faculty member, all of the administration that was there from 1951 through desegregation and the closing of the school in 1967.  There is a timeline of the building of the school as well as an architectural description of the school. And there's many pictures of the organizations and the sports teams. Imagine for the first time, two jurisdictions, the city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County working together to build, own and shortly operate a school.  My project began in 2020, right at the height of the pandemic. So it was really hard to get into UVA Special Collections Library, Library of Virginia, the Historical Society. So it took 18 months from the beginning of my research until the publication of the book. But I did have the opportunity to  interview via telephone students and faculty, which was wonderful and what I'm stressing is that it is so important when writing history.  to pull in segments of oral recollections. That was what really wowed me. That's so important. And working with the Burleigh Varsity Club, we could only locate about 17 of the remaining Falcuti. It's not that many more that remains anyway, but I was able to interview 13 of them and get some wonderful interviews. And I guess one of the most amazing things about  that I learned about the community is that doing a very tumultuous time the parents fought so hard for their children to have a better education, so they partnered with the city and the county and for the first time working together.  they began to erase that unequal educational system that was there at the time, and slowly it proved to be very fruitful. And through my research, some of the most important things that I learned, they were absolutely amazing, is that the land owned by Mr. Burley was acquired by eminent domain.  The African American students from green county attended burley high school because they did not have access to a high school in their county. There were some students there from nelson county and I learned that African American students would only get an education through the 11th grade until burley open.  in 1951 and I think one of the most amazing things and I just really delighted about that is I had the opportunity to reach out to Mr burley's granddaughter. Dr Olivia box and she and I have continued to keep in touch she lives in Atlanta now and that has been wonderful.  with her talking about her family, but what I would like to stress is now is the time to document preserve and never forget the past. As we begin to secure the future by writing our histories and being an advocate and making sure that others are doing the same. The city of Charlottesville and Albemarle County are just rich in history and they have done  an amazing job of preservation, and I think that is wonderful. So thank you for allowing me the opportunity to write about one of your schools. That's a great preservation. And your dedication to public education is absolutely outstanding because it is shaping the lives of our children and preparing them for a brighter future. And one of my last thoughts because  Your Chairman Page had already mentioned about the Burley being on the Virginia Historic Landmark and being on the National Register of Historic Places. And that monument, that marker will be unveiled in April of this year on the grounds of the campus. And my last thought is placing copies of the book in all of the schools  libraries will enhance discussions for students to talk about the schools of yesteryear. And what's so wonderful is that school is now Burleigh Middle School and it, you know, gets a lot of attention. It's been a wonderful school and you've taken really good care of it. You have wonderful students there and I love the administration over there. So thank you for allowing me  to talk about my book tonight. And I hope that there's continued conversations and maybe at some point, some of these various students in the book that gave interviews can go over to some of the schools and the young people can ask questions about the days of yesteryear. Thank you so much for allowing me to discuss this. So I'll take any questions.",

As Ms. Collins shared, we have had some ongoing challenges with staffing due to the COVID surge, but we're able to continue our work in these times due to a group of dedicated employees who are willing to step in, often at the last minute, to cover classes as substitutes.  We are grateful to be able to make some adjustments to their pay for all types of the substitutes that we have. This includes our daily subs who come in each day, often in a different position every day to cover classes. Our long-term subs, we have retirees who have come in and substituted as well. And we also have teachers and staff members who cover classes in addition to their regular daily work.  As a reminder, the increased rate for retirees and the paper staff who do that class coverage for part of a substituted initiative as part of a recent budget. The daily separate is going to be first adjusted and it will keep us competitive with our local school divisions.  And then the other rates will be adjusted accordingly. We anticipate that this change will go into effect by early February. We do want to very much thank those people, our subs, our teachers, and other school staff members who have provided coverage during these very challenging times. And we are pleased to be able to institute these parent changes.",

The school board wishes to maintain appropriate meeting decorum so that persons can observe and hear the proceedings of the school board and that attendees online are not subject to inappropriate language and conduct. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the pandemic.  The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment, despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, writing comments can be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all the school board members for review. You can also email school board members directly or as a group. Second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting.  Before public comment commences, I'm going to announce the order in which speakers will comment. You'll have three minutes to speak. I will notify you when you reach a two-minute mark. It is just me holding up my finger, so it's helpful to time yourself if you can. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address or magisterial district, and further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. Although the school board  will not respond to comments made during the public comment period. School board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business.

    "text": " Good evening, my name is Amanda Moxham and I'm in the Rio district in late December, a group of five families in the Western Albemarle School District filed a lawsuit against the Albemarle County School Board Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent.  The lawsuit asserts that the county's anti-racism policy and the curriculum courageous conversations are perpetuating racism by engaging students in conversations on race, privilege, and systemic oppression. Hate Free Schools Coalition of Elmira County supports the anti-racism policy and the curriculum that challenges our students, teachers, and staff  to teach historical truths and engage in culturally competent conversations. This policy was developed by ACPS students and we endorse their valuable work and are disgusted by the lawsuits devaluing of this landmark policy. Teaching historical truths that have previously been whitewashed is of paramount importance for all students of all cultures and racial backgrounds.  Behind this, there is a coordinated right-wing campaign across the country, which has attempted to consolidate any efforts to address racial inequality under the term critical race theory or CRT. This call to action for conservative parents has them touting any discussions of race as being anti-white, anti-Christian and anti-American.  What I find so interesting is that these political battles are nothing new in US history. Albemarle County is well known for its efforts to block the desegregation of public schools after Brown versus Board of Education through massive resistance. The policy that they officially adopted in 1956 created a situation where for 13 years, our county schools refused to integrate.  Even deeper than that, in the 1920s, I find it interesting this anti-CRT movement is actually very much a mirror to the resistance to teaching the theory of evolution. So if we can think about all of these pieces coming together, the theory of evolution in the 1920s, 21 states debated 53 bills trying to ban the teaching of evolution.  So my hope is with this lawsuit that we code it just as it is it's yet another one of these types of situations where the right wing is continuing to push and push and push, and what we know to be true is that our students deserve better.  Now more than ever, with a pandemic raging across our country and within our schools, highlighting such vast racial disparities that already exist, we need bold truth-telling from our educators and our school district. And we have to have a school district that continues to side on the side of revolutionary work instead of continuing the oppression that has already existed. Thank you so much.",

    "text": " Hi, Emily. Hi there. So I'm Emily Mathon. I'm also in the Rio district. And I was also moved to speak tonight because of the lawsuit that's issued against Dr. Haas, Dr. Harrison, and Albemarle County Public Schools. I've spoken here before in support of anti-racism policies and culturally responsive teaching that is still in the early stages of being integrated throughout the division.  I want to affirm and acknowledge that there is widespread support in the community for the work of Dr. Harrison and his team that have led, that Dr. Harrison and his team have led and continue to cultivate. Do not be deterred by a small group of parents led by a group identified as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and with no connection or stake in our community.  The final sentence of the Albemarle County Public School mission is, we will know every student. And in order to do that, we have to embrace the intersectionality of our children's identities and cultures. We must adapt, grow, and change to create learning environments of belonging that requires effort, intentionality, and discomfort for some.  I wanted to tell you, for the past couple years I've been learning myself from anti racism mentors that are based in Waynesboro.  two women leading this organization, Chanda McGuffin and Sharon Fitts. And this weekend, their organization called RISE will be hosting a community conversation with three powerful guests discussing this very important topic. And I wanted to invite all of you to attend. It's going to be at the Crozet Library at 11 a.m. on Saturday. And I can send an email as well with all the details so that you can look into that. Just want to say in closing, keep up the courageous work. It's important. Thank you.",

I'd like to introduce the item for the comprehensive annual financial report. Each fiscal year, the county as a whole completes an integrated single audit  of all of our financial conditions for both the schools and local government in a single audit. And today we would like to present to you the audit, the comprehensive annual financial report. And we will have Mr. Josh Rohwer partner with Robinson Farmer Cox, our auditors.  Presenting the financial report, Mr. Rohler has been a valued member of RFC for 14 years and has been part of the audit committee, audit team for quite a number of those 14 years. Also, I'd like to mention that this, the financial report was discussed with the audit committee in November. And this is the formal presentation of the audit report to you tonight.  And what I will be doing is bringing up the pages of the audit itself that Mr. Roller is speaking about. It will be very small on most people's screens, but the report is attached.  And Mr. Roller, as he's making his presentations, will be listing the page that he's discussing and y'all can bring it up individually if you wish and make it larger as we move through this process.  Mr. Roller, are you online?",

So like Jackson just introduced, my name is Josh Roller with Robinson Farmer Cox. We're the auditing firm. We're based out of Charlottesville here. Tonight, here to present the fiscal year 21 audit report for the county and school board. And also, like was mentioned,  In November, there was an audit committee meeting where we went over the whole report, the whole letter, and in much more detail than I'm going to today. I'll just kind of point your attention to a few things and be happy to answer any questions you guys have at the end. So starting with that letter, this is the communication with those charged with governance. This is the standard communication required at the end of the audit.  First thing I'll point your attention to is that first paragraph under significant audit matters there talks about how there was one new accounting principle that was adopted this year. It was GASB 84. How it affected the school board was that the school activity funds that all the different schools have, we do separate audits on them on an annual basis.  With this new implementation of GASB 84, those now have to be included in the county and school board annual report. Once we get into the actual financial statements, I'll show you how that actually affected the financials, but it is something that will be a theme throughout this. And if we can go to the next page, actually, we can go to the report from there, Jackson.",

    "text": "Correct. Yep. So starting on page 26, this is the second page of the independent auditor's report. This is where we have issued an unmodified opinion for the county and the school board this year, which is a clean opinion, the best opinion that we can give you all. The second and third paragraphs on this page here is a change in the accounting principle, the restatement of beginning balances,  are both to referencing what I was just talking about there with the GASB 84. You will see on the financial statements, the beginning balances of the net position and beginning fund balances were restated, but that was solely because of this, the implementation of GASB 84. So now we can flip forward quite a bit to page 186, page,  186 is the balance sheet for the school board itself. As you can see, there's a school operating fund, the school food service fund, school capital projects fund, and what's new this year is that school activity funds. And that number there is combined of all of the schools together. And if you flip forward two more pages to page 188,  You'll see in that third column there at the very bottom of the page, the fund balance at the end of the year as restated, that $3.1 million. That was the annual balance from the school activity fund audit report last year. That's just rolled forward into the beginning balance for this year on the annual report here for the county since it was new implementation this year. And then flipping forward to page 213,  Page 213, this is our auditor's report on internal controls over financial reporting. As part of the audit process, we have to do various tests of controls on the county and school board over payroll, accounts payable, receiving money, revenues reported. And as part of our audit process, nothing came to our attention that  needed to be reported in this. At the bottom, it talks about deficiencies and internal controls. There's two different levels of deficiencies where there's significant deficiency and material weakness. We had nothing to report on this letter for any of those. So a clean slate there as well. And flipping forward two more pages to 215.  215, this is our audit report over the federal compliance piece of the county and school board, which increased quite a bit this year with all the CARES and COVID funding. We're required to test various programs depending on size, depending on complexity, and depending on the last time they were audited.  And the programs that we had to audit this year as part of the single audit process, we had no issues that came to anything that has to be reported as an issue of noncompliance. So again, another clean slate there. And the last piece I'll point your attention to is the schedule of expenditures of federal awards. This is page 217 through 219. The school board piece is reported  starting at the bottom of 218 and mostly on 219 here. And as you can see at the bottom of page 219, the total federal expenditures for the school board piece this year was $14,291,000. A couple of things that are a little unique and new this year.  The first program at the top of that page there, the COVID-19 Coronavirus Relief Fund is $2.4 million. And then down close to the bottom under COVID-19 Education Stabilization Fund, another around $2 million there. So as you can see, for this year, compared to previous years, there was around $4.4, $4.5 million of  federal revenues that were expended during the year. And that's my quick spiel. I'll be happy to answer any questions you guys have.",

    "text": " Yes, thank you. Good evening, board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the school division. And I'm here tonight to provide a COVID-19 status update. With me tonight, I'm happy to say are Eileen Gomez, our school nurse coordinator, and Ryan McKay from the Blue Ridge Health Department, who can help answer questions and provide some context for tonight's report. So let's get started.  As you know, our updates align with the most recent guidance provided to us by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Education. And the first metric that we monitor with our COVID reports to the board is the level of community transmission, which we determine using two factors.  One, both of these have jumped to really the highest levels that we've seen since the beginning of the pandemic due to our current Omicron surge. The first figure that we consider is the total number of new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. The most recent data we have is from Monday, January 10th. And at that time, our seven day total per 100,000 people was 850.64.  To give you a little bit of context around that, you know, the level that the threshold for high transmission is 100. We were typically seeing ranges in the round, you know, just over 100 at the beginning of this surge so so significantly higher.  There. The second number that we look at is the percent positivity over the past seven days. That number has also gone much higher than we've seen in the past to 27.98 and that's percentage of an AT tests that come back positive.  in our community. So these levels are both in agreement with each other and clearly put us at the high level of transmission in Albemarle County. And as you can see, we are really as the whole Commonwealth at those high levels.  The second metric that we monitor is the vaccination rates among eligible school age children and those continue really to be a bright spot for us locally, statewide, and I'm assuming at the national level as well. So in Albemarle County, we've got 61.2% of our five to 11 year olds who have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination.  For our 12 to 15-year-olds, that number is 93.8%, and for our 16 and 17-year-olds, that is 92.3%. When you look over at our fully vaccinated numbers, for 5 to 11, we're at 46.6%, 87.4% for our 12 to 15-year-olds, and 86.1% for our 16 and 17-year-olds.  And the final metric that we look at is the degree to which COVID is impacting our school operations. And as expected with this surge, we're seeing increased numbers of cases as students and staff members return to school from the winter break. Numbers so far this week on the COVID dashboard show 47 students and seven staff cases throughout our school division.  We are and will continue to investigate whether any of these cases can be attributed to transmissions within our schools. And while we do not have any indications currently that any of these are school transmissions, as we investigate, that could change.  We continue to monitor student absenteeism and numbers for general absences remain slightly elevated with an attendance rate yesterday of just under 93%. To put that in context, our historical average for attendance is about 95%. Where we are seeing an increase this week is with our number of students who are working from home due to quarantine. That number was below 200 prior to the winter break and as of yesterday stood at 554.  for the school division. And finally, I'd like to give an update on staff capacity. Beginning on Monday, we have increased our detailed monitoring of teacher absences from once a week to daily reports from each of our schools. So each day schools give us their total number of absent teachers and whether or not those absences are COVID related.  This week those those numbers are coming in, kind of in the low 100s, and prior to winter break, they were kind of in the mid 70s. So elevated again there. And, you know, that is probably one of the most significant strains on our system, having teachers out and knowing the challenges of.  of finding substitute teachers for them. Just as a reminder that we continue to have confidence that we have strong mitigation protocols in place in our schools, and those greatly reduce the risk of in-school transmission. They include promotion of vaccination, consistent and correct use of masks, physical distancing, enhanced ventilation,  handwashing and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and maintaining our facilities, having folks stay home when sick, and contact tracing in combination with isolation and quarantine.  And so in addition to our regular COVID update, which was all the previous information that you've seen, I'd like to provide an update and reminder about our COVID dashboard and communications protocols. We've been getting some questions about that this week. Since students have returned to school, we've maintained an ACPS COVID dashboard so that members of our school community can get the most up-to-date information about COVID in our schools as we can possibly provide them.  When we are informed of a positive case in one of our schools. Our first priority is contact tracing an immediate notification of anyone identified as a close contact.  That is followed by a notification to classmates of that student, and then a general notification to the school community about the case. After all of those notifications are complete, we then update this information on the division COVID dashboard. Because of our priority of direct notification and the increase in numbers we are seeing with the Omicron surge, sometimes there can be a delay of one to two days before those cases appear.  on the dashboard. It's also important to note that our dashboard only reflects cases of students who have been positive, while they're physically in our buildings, cases that occurred over winter break with students who did not come to school, or not included on the dashboard.  And with each case that happens with our students, guidance on who needs to quarantine and for how long is one of the most common questions that we get. We're working in close partnership with the health department and local physicians around our quarantine protocols. And we feel that we have strong safeguards in place to prevent the spread of disease. A communication is currently being developed that will be sent to all stakeholders in the near future that helps provide additional clarity to those procedures.  And finally, tonight I'd like to welcome back Ryan McKay from the Blue Ridge Health District, who can provide the board with some additional information about our local conditions and answer any questions that you may have.

    "text": " Thank you and thanks to the board for having me this evening. Again, my name is Ryan McKay, I'm the Director of Policy Planning and COVID Operations for the Health District. And just sort of to reiterate some of the numbers that Dr. McLaughlin had presented, we are seeing by far the largest surge that we've experienced in our community. I would say at this point it's uncontrolled surge.  But our focus and our attention really is on more of the high risk or locations that may have potential for spread. So thinking about congregate settings, schools, for instance, is where a lot of our attention is focused so that we could do everything we can to keep schools open, to keep children in classrooms, to keep disease out from locations where it's going to be at risk for those who are most vulnerable.  In terms of some recent changes from the CDC, and this really speaks to some of the quarantine and isolation components, the CDC had altered its recommendations for the general population. So isolation reduced from 10 days to five days.  in quarantine reduced from 14, 10 or seven days down to five days. Now that's provided that the individual who was in isolation or in quarantine can mask the entire time that they're outside of their home between days six and 10. And what we recognize is that there is still the risk that someone is infectious or that someone can develop disease.  between days six and 10 and potentially infect others. So our recommendation to schools throughout the health district and to daycare centers has been to maintain the 10 days of isolation and quarantine, given how quickly Omicron spreads and the volume of numbers we're seeing in the community. Again, to meet the sole goal of keeping our schools open so that students can continue in-person education.",

    "text": " Yes, so testing is the demand for testing is beyond what any of us who are doing weekly testing events, you know, through the health district through UVA health.  and even some of the private providers can really manage. So we are offering testing Tuesday through Friday at Fashion Square Mall. These are walk-ins on Tuesday through Thursday, and then by appointment on Fridays. Right there, that's probably somewhere in the ballpark of 1,500 to 1,800 tests, depending on staffing levels through our vendor, Nexmolecular. They run those on Tuesday through Thursday.  UVA is operating testing events Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Charlottesville at two different churches. And that's probably 600 to 700 tests total. Something new that's opening up on Saturday is a new testing center for the community in the Pantop Shopping Center in Charlottesville.  They'll be open on Saturdays through Thursdays, closed on Fridays, and then they're going to offer around 2200 tests total for the week, and those are by appointment only. For those testing events, there are no requirements. You do not need to be asymptomatic. Age is a little bit of a requirement for the new community testing center at Pantop, so I think you need to be three and above.  while others, I think it's down to six months. So within those different locations, it's about 4,000 to 4,500 tests, depending on the week, that are gonna be available to the public. And again, just given how much we're seeing in terms of Omicron in our health district, it's gonna be difficult to get to some of those testing events. We are trying to relieve some of the burden in Charlottesville and Albemarle, but making sure that we're offering testing events throughout the health district in each of our localities.  But again, there's going to be limitations, both in terms of the number of hours, but then lab space is also going to be a bit of a limitation, as all of these events, aside from UVA's events, are sending tests to our lab at the state office in Richmond.  So we'll maintain that level for the next month or so and then potentially increase depending on the availability of lab space and then what this new testing center begins to see. There are a couple of private testing vendors out there, one in particular that's doing 400 tests a day. They're operating out of Seminole Square, which is right near where the Community Vaccination Center is.  We do anticipate that there will be more at home tests available either through the federal government or distributed through health department or pharmacies. But again, these don't necessarily provide the right level of reliability that a PCR test does. So if someone is asymptomatic,  and getting a test because they've been exposed, it's not going to be as accurate. Now, when someone is symptomatic, it does offer a higher level of reliability. The problem with that is that some of these tests, unless they're proctored, they're at home, there's no reporting component to it. And so we're really relying on the individual who tests positive to report that to the health district or obviously to schools.  One thing I would add to that, so depending on where the test specimen goes, wait times for the results are going to vary. So right now, tests that go to the state lab, it's taking at least 72 hours. Labs that go to UVA Health are probably taking somewhere between 48 and 72. And the next molecular, I think it's somewhere around 48 to 72.  So that is going to be a little bit of a factor in terms of when we are able to find out which tests are positive and how we respond appropriately.",

    "text": "We certainly can communicate that in fact that will be one of our big points of highlighted tomorrow in our newsletter that goes out each week. So, obviously things that are high filtration and 95s KN95s KN94s are going to be the ones that are most successful at preventing spread but also protecting the person who's wearing it.  surgical masks offer a little higher protection for individuals and certainly for those wearing them than cloth masks. I do think the key point that Eileen mentioned is that it's really about comfort level with the mask. Is it a mask that a student, particularly younger students in elementary schools,  are going to be good with wearing throughout the entire day, aside from when they're eating, when they're drinking, when they need a little bit of a break. And because we want to make sure that they're comfortable so that they do wear that all day long.  KN95s or KN94s for children are going to be a little bit more difficult. They take a lot longer to get used to. The breathability obviously is going to be a little more challenging. And that's sort of the trade off when you use those for protection. I do think it's a great idea that teachers have access and staff have access to the KN95s. They're going to be able to adjust to that a little bit better than obviously the students will. And we are looking at procuring through a donor.  between 20 and 30,000 masks that we would distribute to schools of varying sizes so that they could be distributed to elementary students, middle and high school, for those that don't have access, but also as another way of protection that schools can use to mitigate spread.",

I think on Sunday, there were 89 total in the hospital at UVA Health. I also know that Cintero and Martha Jefferson are seeing the most cases they've seen. I'm not sure what that means in terms of ICU beds being occupied for individuals with COVID. But one thing they're also seeing, and it's sort of hard  separate the two right now, which is people who are in the hospital due to COVID and the health outcomes that they're experiencing versus those that are in the hospital for something else and also have COVID. And so it's a little bit of a difference there, but hospital capacity they're managing, but that means there's not much wiggle room for other things. Sentara came out and said, I think it was last week that they're no longer doing elective surgeries and procedures. So that's an indication of sort of the burden that's on the hospitals.  And there's always a lag when it comes to hospitalizations and COVID. It's about one to two weeks when we begin to see what that looks like from our current situation to what that means for the hospitals. So it is a strain. Their staffing is strained. We're going into year three and their staff are extremely tired. And so it is a challenge. What we heard on Monday is that they're managing it and we'll see where we go from here.",

I have with me for tonight's presentation, Ms. Kim Gibson, Lead Coach with Responsibilities for the Oversight of Talent Development, and Dr. Melanie Lichtenstein, Talent Development Specialist. Tonight, we're going to bring you an update on our continued shift in gifted programming.  We will be looking at some historical data to give context to what ACPS has been doing since the last board presentation.  on gifted services during the fall of 2018. This slide deck is full of resources and additional information so that you may check those out at your leisure. We will not be discussing every link that we've provided. Specifically tonight, we will provide information on where we were in the fall of 2018, what we've been doing, key strategies that are making a difference, our results to date, our next steps, and at the conclusion of the presentation, we will take questions.  If you recall, in the fall of 2018, our equity dashboard continued to identify the inequities in our gifted identification process. These glaring inequities brought forth a call to action. A comprehensive plan of action was provided to rethink gifted programming, and with the approval of a budget proposal for the school year 2019-20, the work began in earnest.  This concentrated effort has evolved our definition of gifted and the types of services we provide. We are moving from a model of giftedness for some to a framework of talent development for all. At this point, I'd like to introduce Melanie Lichtenstein.  who is our talent development specialist. She will guide you through the rest of the presentation. Dr. Lichtenstein came to us with a doctorate in educational planning, policy, and leadership, with a specialty in gifted and talented and equity. She has helped us focus and concentrate our efforts on key strategies for shifting our practice. Dr. Lichtenstein.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ms. Collins, and thanks to the board for allowing me to speak this evening.  about our work that has been happening in the schools around talent development and rethinking gifted education for Albemarle County Schools. As Ms. Collins stated, there are numerous links throughout this presentation that are available for you to peruse further. I'm gonna highlight three key areas that have been important in making the shift towards talent development. They are professional learning,  the teaching and learning structures put into place and data collection. The fourth strategy was to align the local plan with the language of the division strategic plan, equity language and research based practices. I will not spend time reviewing this document, but the link is provided. Before starting with these, I wanna mention some background on changing the name of our model from a gifted program to talent development services. In addition to explaining the paradigm shift  It also fostered a mindset shift. This also meant a name change of the teachers from Gifted Resource Teachers, GRT, to Talent Development Resource Teachers, TDRT. The name is more reflective of the work that they do. So starting in the fall of 2019, we conducted monthly professional development  with principals, assistant principals, and other division leadership around the shift from a gifted identification model to a talent development framework. This helped inform school leaders around the inclusive focus and understanding of the shift of the role of PDRT and to ensure that school structures allowed opportunities and services to be available to all students. Professional development work with the CDRTs focused on instructional strategies of differentiation in the classroom.  This allowed for TDRTs to develop partnerships with teachers and help the understanding that talent development is not limited to a single teacher, but a school-wide and division-wide practice. The goal is to continue building collective efficacy of all teachers around students' strengths and talents. Professional learning would not have been possible without directly working towards addressing the understanding of strengths and potential in students.  Throughout intentional professional learning, the school administrators, teachers, and TDRTs have been introduced to the use of observation scales called TOPS, Teacher Observation of Potential in Students. This tool has allowed for deliberate work with educators to practice seeing talent in all students and understanding that gifts look different for everyone and how to spot talent and potential in students  This practice aligns with the division-wide approach to culturally responsive education. I'm gonna go through the series of slides fairly quickly, because I wanna get to the good part. As we began collecting data, we had a cumbersome system of tracking using Google Sheets. We were able to see when and what learning experiences we had with the students. And what we found was that although  we were able to understand the time and what they were doing, we needed to have a more direct connection with who specifically was getting talent development experiences and who we needed to adjust. So we worked with Mark Leach and Sarah Dusenberry of the technology department, and we moved from spreadsheets that were like this, that gave us this sort of data, where we have lists and then some slides,  we were able to see time and what specific services were happening. And then we shifted to our newest approach, which is integrating documenting services with the division-wide student information system, PowerSchool. And this is brand new, and it allows us to link services directly with students and teachers. So the direct face-to-face with teachers,  that is collaborative as well as working directly with students. In this slide, you'll see four images. On the top left, it's the entry screen where TDRTs enter the different talent development experiences. And once that's recorded, the system allows us to, if we wanted to, go to a specific student and see what talent development experiences they had.  We can see how the services are distributed across grade levels, and because of the use of PowerSchool, we can get a more accurate data around the demographics of the students that are engaged. This allows us to have useful data to audit the services so that we can shift our services to ensure access for all and build capacity for all teachers. This is still in the development stage, and the TRTs are working through the system to ensure it's the best use of the tool.  I'm very proud of the work that we've been doing in this regard because it positions ACPS as a leader in the state and potentially nationwide around how we're collecting data regarding talent development, instead of the previous model where it really only showed us who got a gifted label and then on the flip side, who did not get a gifted label.  So the results of our data shows that as shifting from a program mindset to services, along with intentional work around how we use the gifted label to ensure students' needs are being met in the classroom, collaboration with the culturally responsive education practice to shift mindsets and practices has shown an overall increase in our historically underrepresented groups of students having a gifted label. Additionally, as the new state mandate is presented for the  the school board, the state school board rather, we're going to be well ahead of the curve illustrating how talent development is a practice that is more inclusive and more intentional for all student educational trajectories.  So what's happening next, our goals moving forward are to further develop services and practices that are sustainable, transferable, and equitable, to continue fine-tuning our data collection and continue site-based talent development evaluation and expanded partnerships with community content experts and the equity teams. And what I mean by sustainable, transferable, and equity services  That includes strategic planning around strength-based instruction, student autonomous learning, and further development of student potential and interest, specifically creating an intentional through line from elementary to the high school learning communities and onward to post-secondary success. The TDRTs will have continued development of products that encourage the use of TOPS, participation in the PLC Plus process,  and responsive talent development opportunities and asset-based learning lessons for our kindergarten to second grade students that we call K2ABLE. This will also include continual professional development and learning with the TDRTs. They are a wealth of knowledge and we wanna ensure that they are utilized to the best of their ability at their schools as resources for teachers, as well as working with students.  And the ongoing practice that we have of equity audits allows us collection of meaningful and useful data to ensure that students' educational needs are being met in the classroom and will guide them throughout their K-12 experiences. So at this point, we will be able to take some questions.",

    "text": " So the Office of Civil Rights actually frowns upon creating quotas. So by putting numbers on who we want to include and exclude, it kind of is counter to our model. So our goal is to ensure that the teachers are collaborating with the TDRTs to build their efficacy regarding differentiated instruction and understanding what talent looks like, as well as documenting who the teachers are working with  and the TDRTs, I mean, so that if they're missing certain groups, because there are structures in place that are preventing that, we can then make moves. But we haven't defined a particular threshold in regards to what is a talent development experience, because as students, as when we look at the data from elementary, middle, and high school, it changes very significantly. So in elementary, you see a lot of,  whole class work where the TRT is collaborating and pushing in. There are some opportunities for small groups. Currently, because of the mitigation strategies, small grouping has been kind of held off a little bit because we don't want to have cross-contamination of students in classes.  In middle school, when they get there, the students are able to really kind of start thinking about what they're interested in, and so the work becomes more about small groups, more about class selection, not as much pushing in and doing whole class instruction, unless it's for a collaborative process.  And when they get to high school, you see a lot more one-on-one work with the TDRT because of students who are interested in post-secondary applications, governor school opportunities. And sometimes students will not work with the TDRT because their interests lie in other areas. Because in high school, you have more specialized experts. So you can have students who may not interact with the TDRT, but they work extensively with their physics teacher.  or with the drama teacher. So the model has kind of it fluxes as the students learning needs go with them. So right now, defining a threshold, like we don't want to say every kid will know that they've had this much, but we want to make sure that the experiences are accessible.",

Because we weren't able to really  get a strategy in place that would create revenues or direct monies to CIP for building of schools. And until we've really got a channel and a system in place, and I mean, there's so many different ways that could be done, but I just wouldn't be comfortable with doing a policy in this area.

    "text": "One thing that Dr. Kaiser, you know, this was a part of a slate of improvements that we did around substitutes. And the other part that the increased  funding into our base operational budget for this year that the board approved tonight as part of the consent agenda that Ms. Schmidt pulled. That's helping to fund these changes in addition to hiring a permanent substitute at each school as a beginning. And then we're going to establish staffing standards  so that larger schools would have more of what we would call permanent substitutes at the school to help cover when teachers need to be out. It's certainly needed during this time. However, I really feel that prior to the pandemic, we did have shortages of coverage for our teachers so that they can take off when they need to take off so that they can be well. So that's just one of the pieces that the board  approved tonight. If you go back and look at the line items for that approval, you put in place a lot of things for our employees around compensation and other benefits that are going to help them through the spring. So thank you.",
