    "text": "And my name is Jono Alcaro. I'm the at-large member of the Albemarle County School Board. I will state for the record, and the minutes of this meeting should so reflect, that the meeting is being held electronically pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance.  because the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location. The meeting is being streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website and public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission.  I'd also like to say for anybody listening in who is looking at an older agenda, item 2.2 has been moved to the second meeting, which would be a week from tomorrow, of the school board retreat. Ms. Schmidt is going to be meeting with some of the people involved in that particular issue.  We would like to incorporate that into the presentation to the board. And I just want to read one statement that I think is highly important. Tomorrow, June 19, is the oldest national celebration of the ending of slavery in the United States. On that day in 1865,  A general order was read to the people of the last slave-holding state in the Union in Texas, which said in part, all slaves are now free. The order proclaimed that this action involved the absolute equality of rights between former slaves and their owners. History has sadly not agreed.  Over the past 155 years, slavery's disgraceful legacy separated those rights, consistently destroying lives and families and causing incalculable damage to our nation. It is still doing those awful things today. Public schools were not established for such purposes. They were established to be the place where all children  would receive equal opportunities to be safe and cared for and to learn and develop at their highest potential. We are not yet such a place. Earlier this week, Governor Northam said, slavery is not just the history of our black communities, this is everyone's shared history.  Our anti-racism policy promises, quote, we are committed to establishing and sustaining an equitable community that achieves the school division's equity mission to end the predictive value of race and ensure the success of each individual student and staff member. To appropriately embrace this unity of purpose,  It is imperative that our school division join the state and our country, and our county, rather, in designating June 19, Juneteenth, as a time of personal reflection and renewed commitment to racial justice and equality for all. A day that stands in tall fulfillment of the four values of our school division, to serve all of our students all of the time,  to partner with members of our community, to respect all, and to achieve excellence in our relationships with all. It is appropriate to celebrate that which is the true place of public education in our communities and in our nation. And so I call upon my colleagues on the board to approve effective immediately that every June 19 will be a day of honor.  a day of personal reflection and renewed commitment to equal opportunity and justice for all, and be set aside as a paid holiday for all school division employees. May I have a motion, if someone is comfortable, to approve this?  I move that we approve the statement, placing the Juneteenth statement, placing our county in line with county and state guidelines as outlined by Governor Northam.",

First, I just have a brief update on our student meal service. Our student meal service is continuing to operate as we transitioned into the summer.  Sorry, I want to make sure I was on the right side there. Most certainly, as we transitioned into the summer, we did make some slight location and time changes. Most notably, at smaller stops, we were able to consolidate and reduce to only three days a week. This was more efficient on our side, but hopefully more convenient for families as well. Students received two days worth of meals at a time, so they are still receiving the same amount of food.  We have publicly communicated that we are operating through June 30th, but we are finalizing details to continue throughout the summer, and we'll communicate times and locations once they are set. Just this week, we've learned that the DOE and the USDA have continued all previous waivers, which is great news and will allow us to serve all schools throughout the summer. I will now hand it over to Dr. Kaiser, who will review how we are bringing staff back to our buildings.",

    "text": " Good afternoon board, this is Claire Kaiser assistant superintendent. I'm very pleased to share with you that we have begun to return the work we have begun the return to work process for our 11 and 12 month staff members.  We are doing this through a phased approach to allow our employees to return to work in a safe manner as we prepare for the opening of school. Through each of these phases, we continue to follow the guidelines of the CDC, the Virginia Department of Health, as well as advisement from Governor Northam and our state superintendent.  Summer phase one began this past Monday. During this phase, our employees may continue to telecommute as their work allows. For employees whose work does not allow for them to telecommute, we have welcomed them back physically to their workspace. Most of the employees who have reported back to work at their physical sites are in the support services. The leadership of each of our support departments has developed protocols for their employees to return to work.  These include, but are not limited to, the adjustment of schedules and workspaces to allow for physical distancing, use of masks when physical distancing is not allowable, and daily employee health self-screenings. They also have done orientations to ensure that employees are aware of the expectations and changes to the protocols from what they typically have done in their workspace. With the start of summer phase one, the need for essential pay is eliminated per our building closure policy.  We will begin summer phase two on July 6th. The goal of this phase is to transition all of our 12-month employees back to their work sites. While this will begin July 6th, the transition will be completed with all 12-month employees physically back at work 15 days, 15 work days that is, prior to the teachers returning. Beginning July 6th, phones will again be answered at the school or department rather than using a centralized phone line as we have done through the closure.  Our buildings will be open for visitors by appointment and with direction from the governor and state superintendent. There will be limited on-site student experiences for both learning and athletics. Principals and department leaders are working on protocols to safely bring their employees back to work in this phase. The third phase will be encompassed in the return to school plan that we will be sharing later in this meeting.  We recognize that there is considerable concern by our employees regarding the safe return to work. Through our current leave options and the Families First Coronavirus Relief Act, which allows for emergency sick leave and emergency family medical leave for qualified employees, we will work with our employees who feel that they are not able to return to work. We recognize that this is a delicate balance between the needs of the employees and the ability for us to return to the normal operations of the school division.  And with that, I will turn it over to Ms. Collins.",

The option, the summer learning begins in July, July 6th to the 31st. In elementary schools, we're doing something a little different based on our continuity of learning. We are going to post and offer enrichment opportunities for all. So each week during July, we have teachers that will be posting to the division website, enrichment opportunities that are gauged to K2, K3, K5,  and 6-8. So those opportunities are ones that any student can get involved in and can work through and work on. With our elementary schools, we're going to do a check and connect, which would be a sign up. So if a parent would like for a teacher to reach out to their student and work with them on the enrichment opportunities, then that would be something that the parent and child can sign up to do through the elementary school. And then we will continue offering our tutoring option.  for identified students, which is typically what we offer during the summer school. So that would be the three phases or the three tiers that would be offered in elementary school. Similarly, in middle school, we'll offer an enrichment opportunity for all, a check and connect component with students who did not engage or complete their continuity of learning in the spring. And then we will continue offering our tutoring options to identified students.  High school is exactly as offered with the summer school courses that students sign up for and participate in. We also will offer a check and connect for students who did not engage or complete the spring courses. As I said, these are July options. Some of the high schools and middle schools are continuing in June or beginning in June to do the check and connect so not to lose any momentum  with the spring learning.",

I forget what they were for, to be honest with you, but I just have to say. So he was, I have to say, first of all, I'm really proud of Robbie. That's customer service right there for him to be out there doing that. The other thing he told me was that our summer school enrollment is very high this summer. It's much higher than it has been in the past. I asked him how much higher, he didn't have the numbers on hand, but he said,  It's 612. Did someone say something? It's 612 students. OK, great. And so what is it? Typically, it's in the neighborhood of about 400, I think. So he was pretty excited about that because he feels like students are taking advantage of the online opportunity.",

We reviewed information shared by Governor Northam, the Virginia Department of Education, and the Center for Disease Control. There were many topics that we discussed early on, but we defined our purpose to develop practices and protocols that were necessary in reopening schools in a safe manner for all of our stakeholders.  We narrowed our focus to four areas, cleaning, building and grounds, transportation, and our response to confirmed cases of COVID-19. So cleaning and disinfecting of learning spaces and materials before, during, and after all uses. We will follow the guidelines from the Center for Disease Control and Health Organizations to operate our buildings  to reduce the exposure of COVID-19. We will maximize the spaces that we have in our building, utilizing our buildings to minimize contact and the sharing of equipment. Transportation, which is one of the highest priorities for us returning to school. Establishing protocols for cleaning our buses before and after use. Using personal protection equipment.  for students and staff, maintaining social distancing, designing routes to meet the needs of all of our students and families, and communication on the use of transportation, the expectations, and our schedules.

Dr. Kaiser and I were also privileged to work with 14 talented educators on the healthy staff section of the document.  As we began work, we were often guided by the essential question of what will it take to have employees feel as safe and confident as possible in returning to work. After much brainstorming, we landed on a statement of purpose that you see before you, and three key areas of physical safety, mental health, and attendance and leave. Professional development was an area that ran throughout the entire document, and the steering committee decided to consolidate it under healthy staff, giving us our four key areas.  Each work group worked to come up with guidelines for strategies in those areas that encompass the scope of action that will be necessary to achieve our purpose. Physical safety, while having some overlap with healthy environments, our group focused on creating guidelines for creating staff health screening upon entrance, physical distancing measures, consideration for PPE for different staff members based on contact with others, and how staff should interact with visitors in the building.  Mental health was a key component and concern for our group as we acknowledge the added stress that teaching and working in the pandemic will have. The work group worked with human resources on both the schools and the local government side to focus on making sure that we were promoting programs currently in place, adding additional support for administrators and supervisors to be able to guide staff to those resources and creating a peer-to-peer program for providing support.  As I said previously, professional development was the theme throughout, and we'll need to take steps to make sure that all employees are knowledgeable and have the skills to manage both the changes in practice for health and safety, as well as making sure that we're prepared to meet the instructional needs of our students in different environments. Attendance and leave is a technical area for our group, as we need to respond to employees with a varied set of circumstances.  The workgroup was able to create guidelines that we feel are based both around the types of leave available and mandated by federal regulations, and an overall sense that as an organization, we will work with employees to accommodate their situations for their safety while meeting the needs of our students. There's obviously a lot of work still to be done, but we feel that our workgroup has captured the scope and guidelines necessary to create and implement practices that will ensure a healthy, safe, and productive return to work for our staff.

I worked with our director of secondary education, Jay Thomas, and a team of about 20 other educators on the Healthy Students group.  Our group focused on four main areas in order to prioritize the physical and mental health of all of our students. Those four areas were physical health and safety, mental health and well-being, scheduling options, and athletics, field trips, and extracurriculars. We had four main guiding questions that drove our committee work. I will highlight some key areas from each question for you all today.  Under physical health and safety, we will both coordinate and partner with families to educate them on the symptoms of COVID-19 and the procedures for what to do if they think their child is ill or has become exposed to the virus. We will survey families to determine the current health of students and needs of the family before we reopen. We will work to develop safety protocols that align to the public health guidelines.  Schools will repurpose non-traditional learning spaces such as cafeterias and gyms to comply with social distancing guidelines. We will also minimize the amount of movement in between classes at especially the elementary school level. In order to identify and support the mental health and wellbeing of all of our students, we will collaborate with our school counselors and community service providers to develop protocols and procedures to support our students. Again, this will include a survey to families to determine needs  We will develop and strengthen our current programs, such as Check and Connect, Freshman Seminar, Responsive Classroom, and Developmental Designs. We will establish a community outreach team to partner with Region 10, DSS, and other community agencies. Next, we focused on scheduling options that would support multiple learning environments. This was an extremely challenging area to think through. We determined that scheduling should be equitable and flexible.  and might vary based on elementary and secondary levels and even specific buildings for the needs of all students. And although you won't see specific plans outlined, we felt strongly that we needed to prioritize in-person learning for our youngest students, English language learners and students with disabilities. In order to do this, we will have to communicate and coordinate with transportation services to ensure that we can meet the transportation needs of any potential plan that we put in place.",

Our Healthy Learning Committee had 25 members from K-12 educators  who represented diverse perspectives across the division. Our first task was to reflect and brainstorm together what worked for our students during the COVID-19 and what did not work. One of the key things we heard was how critical it was for teachers  to stay connected with their students to help them navigate learning through this new environment. Those learning partnerships were essential in offering social-emotional support and offering choice in how students could demonstrate their learning. We developed five focus areas that you see before you that include design principles and practices to serve as guidelines to ensure our support of student learning.  Our commitment is that our shared philosophical tenets of high quality teaching and learning will be present in any environment, which leads to our healthy learning guiding questions to address those five focus areas.

And I think you'll see that in the bibliography and some of the resources that's been provided in this document. But it's a very intricate and complex  problem to try to wrap your head around and I think these 80 educators and staff really did an amazing job in such a short time to give us a planning guide that will give us a way to think about school starting and a way for us to move forward. I think that it also gives us direction that we will use whether we're in a time of pandemic virus or not.  There's great direction around some of the things that we need to consider as we move forward.",

One of the things we know that is the burning question with our parents and with our students and with our teachers is, so how will you begin the fall? And based on the information we've had from the governor's planning documents and from this planning document from the CDC, from our regional health department, we are looking towards starting the school year.  and a hybrid learning model. And by that, we mean that one portion of the student body will attend classes on the campus for a period of time, while another portion may learn remotely. Two groups may alter days or weeks on campus to build a blended learning environment, and elementary students' schedule may be different than middle school and high school. And I think that's one of the things you heard in the recommendation from our task force, but also from the governor's task force, that elementary students, especially our younger students,  perhaps need to be on buildings more often, as well as special needs, our ELL learners and other groups of students. Students without access may have different kinds of opportunities to be in buildings as other, but we wanted to go ahead and let everyone know at this point in time, based on the guidance that we're seeing, that this is how school will begin.  moving towards getting, having our students in the buildings as often as we can. We know that's critical, but we also know that we have challenging logistics to try to do that in a safe way. We also will be offering parents a virtual learning option so that you may continue to stay at home, learn virtually, but stay in a parallel way with what's happening  in the regular classroom. So we wanted to go ahead and put that out there. This is not the recommendation of the task force, but in guidance with the task force, we feel like that this is important information to go ahead and let our parents, staff and students know. So Debbie, if for the middle school, high school kids who are doing",

Because all that information allows us to determine how many students  we can transport at a time and how many parents. We also have been working with the health department about the recommendation around transportation. If you read some of the guidelines, it looks like it might be every other seat. So for our biggest buses, that's 12 students and  For other conversations, it might be every seat, there's one student. So we're trying to get some more definitive information around that because that changes the number of students that we can get into the building every day. And we're determined and really pushing ourselves to get as many children in the buildings as we can. So that's part of it where I think  We could say that here's the schedule, we're gonna have elementary children come in every other day, secondary children come in every other day, and we could move with that, but we don't feel like that's necessarily the right thing to do.

It's our first period, and we're going to do math for so long together in Zoom or in Schoology.  And then if a child was taking that course, they could parallel the work in that virtual learning environment, but they're not necessarily ever coming into the building. So you have a group of students that would come into the building ever so often. However, that schedule works out, but you might have a parallel group that stays virtual, but they could come into those classes, if you will,  listen to the teacher, work on that, but they would stay in a virtual environment.

So, I mean, again, we haven't landed all this, but there are those kinds of things that you can begin to think about. But principals will know better as soon as we can think about a schedule and teachers and staff see that, then they're going to be able to say,  that works for me or that's difficult for me. So the sooner we can get to this place and the next place, I think the student principals will know what staff will be in the building and which staff members need other accommodations or leave or those kinds of pieces. So that's one of the reasons we wanted to go ahead and come out today and begin this kind of discussion.  that everyone would know how we're leaning and how we're thinking about this. I think it would be appropriate to get Ross to meet with the principals and Claire about requests for reasonable accommodations so we're not",

    "text": " Good afternoon, board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning. And before I dive into the calendar, I just want to respond once more to Ms. Lee's request I just heard from Jennifer Butler and COVID-19 results will be posted on our survey results page this afternoon. So I'll send those to you as well, but any members of the public can access those then. So onto the calendar. As part of our return to school plan, Albemarle County Public Schools solicited feedback from the community about changing the start date  of school to be later in the year. As you can see here, our response rate was very robust. Usually when we do a calendar survey, we're lucky to get about 11 or 1,200 respondents. We had close to 5,000 this time. Most of those were parents and staff members and students, but also had about 95 community members. And that's in the space of less than a week. We opened up the survey on June the 11th and just closed it yesterday.  And so I'll share the results of that survey with you tonight. I want to just take a minute, too, to thank Mr. Page for encouraging us last week to look for ways to engage stakeholders without Internet access in the survey. With a very quick turnaround time, the technology and communications teams enacted a phone survey feature in Blackboard Connect that we hadn't used before.  This allowed us to send a phone survey in both English and Spanish to 568 homes without internet access. 101 of those families opted to participate. And I think this is just a wonderful example of a practice that helps to close the opportunity gap for families in the school division.  So onto the results. A majority of respondents believe that the later start date would be beneficial to students. That was the first question that we asked them. You can see that 51.8% responded with either a four or a five in terms of the benefits of a later start date.  Close to 30% of respondents believed a change would not be beneficial to students. And this had a weighted score of 3.36 out of five, which indicates to us the general consensus is to shift the start date to a later date in the school calendar. Next, we asked folks to what degree they were satisfied with each of our two drafts.  For the start date of September 2nd, respondents were asked to rate their level of satisfaction. This one had a weighted score below three, indicating that respondents would not be satisfied with this draft calendar. The plurality of the responses was a neutral response, indicating they were neither satisfied or dissatisfied, which could show a little bit of ambivalence toward this particular version of the calendar.  The second calendar option with a September 8th start date was rated more favorably with a weighted score of 3.45 indicating general satisfaction. The plurality of responses selected very satisfied with this draft and about 28.5% of responses selected a level of dissatisfaction with this draft of the calendar.  We had about 250 pages of comments to go through. And so with the survey ending yesterday, we have not been able to disaggregate those in a way that would be meaningful to the board yet. But as soon as we have that, we can pass that information along to you. And so we just wanted to talk about next steps. That our hope, as you saw in Ms. Collins' presentation earlier, is that we can have a board vote on the calendar at the June 26th as part two of the board retreat. And really there you've got three options to stick with the original calendar,  to move to the September 2nd start date in the calendar or to move to the September 8th start date in the calendar. And so that's our hope that on the 26th, we can finalize that and have one more item checked off the list as we begin to implement our return to school plan. So those are the results of the survey. They will be, I believe they are already published on our survey results page as well for the public to see. And I'll be happy to take any questions that you have.",

Now, current thinking is that we'll have a window prior to the start of the school year for teacher professional development. On one calendar, I believe you see 12 days of PD. On another, you see 15 days there. It may be that we bring back teachers in a staggered way, that half of our teachers come back on Monday, and then another half on Tuesday, and we stagger them through that. So it could be.  that we go back to 195 actual present days for our teachers. But either way, with whatever gets decided, we would not exceed the 200-day teacher contract that we have for everyone.",

When you look at the September 2nd start date, we see a weighted score just under three, which indicates a slight inclination toward dissatisfied.

One is that in the COVID-19 survey response, one of the things that we heard from teachers was that if we are going to some type of online learning next year, the teachers felt they wanted more time for professional development. A later start date would allow for that to happen.

The majority of the school systems in Virginia run on a post-Labor-Day start date. And I think, and our staff wanted to test and see what people would think about a post-Labor-Day start date because we believe that  we will be getting closer to Phase 3, if not in Phase 3, when Labor Day comes around. So that was the other piece, was to try to open up, not have to open up in Phase 2 if we didn't necessarily have to, and then have to shift then to Phase 3. It could be more efficient. So...

Most of the school systems, particularly, the reason I look at it this way, too, is all around Richmond, the school systems start  after Labor Day. And so the capitals in Richmond, the governors in Richmond, the VDOEs in Richmond, also on the south side, Peninsula, they all start after Labor Day. So we're all, we're just kind of looking at it that way that how do we get in alignment with moving toward phase three? Now, I do think it's important to ask our community and that's why we did the survey. And I really appreciate the board's patience  with us having an established calendar and then coming back and saying, hey, would y'all entertain asking the public? And I'm really grateful to all the families for chiming in and letting us know what you think. I will say that I did discuss, I have been in discussion with a post-Labor-Day start with city school staff  from the very beginning of our conversations about this. And I asked if city school staff would be interested in looking at this type of calendar. I understood at that time that there was some interest. They have not asked their community yet through a survey as to whether they would begin after Labor Day or not. I think they might, I think they may, but I obviously have no way of influencing that other than through collaboration.  We do have, I am working on scheduling a meeting with our counterparts in the city for next Wednesday to discuss not only the post Labor Day start, but also what we are looking at as we begin to firm up our school site plans around offering instruction to students. I know they had already published some things to their community and  I think they're also interested in learning more about what we're gonna be doing. I think it's important to just say those things because I want the board to know that we are trying to coordinate with the city and with what they're doing. If we end up on different schedules, we're gonna work with our staff. We're gonna work with our teachers, with our support staff to make sure that we meet their needs and help them as they make their way back to work.",

I was thinking about Nick King. You all aren't aware, but Nick is in the hospital. So if you get another opportunity for a moment of silence later on, or you're just thinking about people you care about, please throw Nick into your thoughts. I'm a little worried about him. We asked Nick, after our board meeting last week, to start looking at doing a quick turnaround program review.  of our SRO program. And so he's been doing a little bit of work on that. During our board meeting rehearsal yesterday, we saw the presentation that Nick was working on and also he was working in consultation with Jamie because she's our program evaluator. And so we asked her to come today to the board. And the goal is for Jamie to be able to present to the board  an outline of a relatively speedy, I guess, review or a review of the current state. It's not really an evaluation in a sense that we're going to make a recommendation to the board. We just simply want to provide good information, the best information that we can provide about our local context, as well as the context of Virginia, given that this is a national phenomenon right now that we're looking at.  I will just say that from my perspective, when I was a kid and my dad was teaching me how to do carpentry, if he was doing something to fix a rotten panel on the house or maybe build something out back, one of the things he taught me was you always measure twice and cut once. That you, for some reason in our society today,  We never seem to have time to do something right the first time. We always seem to have time or don't have time, but we make time to fix it after we make a decision when we didn't have enough information to make the decision in the first place. But I believe that you should measure twice and cut once so that when you cut, you are cutting where you intended to cut and you would cut in a way that you could  accommodate the rest of the structure with the decision that you made. So I would say just so the board understands from a staff perspective, from a school perspective, we will work with whatever decisions that the school board makes that we're not here to advocate one way or another. We're simply gonna provide the best information that we think we can provide you in a time so that you can measure twice  and cut once. I don't think I had any other notes on that. I do know I read an article yesterday that Phil provided that just to provide a context that Richmond City Schools is also looking at changing their relationship with their police department. And they're taking 90 days to study that relationship before they make that decision.  And we're gonna continue to provide articles to the board to let you know what other school systems are doing. That actually came out of the Virginia School Board Association newsfeed that all the board members get. So anyway, at this time, I'm gonna turn things over to Jamie to give you an outline of what we think we can do. And then any questions that you have for her, we'll relay back to the cabinet and Nick and see what you wanna do.",

    "text": "Okay, thank you. I'm Jamie Gellner, the division program evaluator filling in on behalf of Nick King, our student services officer. And last week you asked us to put together a program review in our school resource officer program. So here are our ideas moving forward with a quick turnaround. And as Dr. Haas stated,  we are gonna be providing with a lot of information and there will not be an evaluative part of the review. As you may know, our MOU, formerly called the Joint Protocol between ACPS and ACPD, states that the scope of the SRO responsibilities include these things, to promote a positive and supportive school climate, as well as safe and secure environments, to collaborate with the schools and to reduce and prevent crime,  to minimize student involvement with the criminal justice systems. The MOU points out that the school resource officer, therefore, has many roles in our schools, including law enforcement officer, law-related educator, informal mentor and role model, resource for criminal charges and cases, and a resource for information on gang activity and participation.  Our program has five officers, one at Albemarle High School and one to cover the rest of the feeder pattern, one at Monticello and one to cover the rest of the feeder pattern, and one in the Western feeder pattern. The SROs report to their own chain of command and Nick is our direct contact for ACPS. We will pull together several pieces of data for the board. The Code of Virginia requires school divisions to submit data to VDOE  on incidents of disciplined crime and violence. Current reports contain selected comparisons to prior years. And this data are used also to complete federal reports required by the Gun Free Schools Act and the Individual with Disabilities Education Act. This report requires an annual reporting of the number of students suspended or expelled statewide for possessing or bringing firearms on school property.  We'll also look at our state and local climate surveys, which have statements about how safe students feel at school, although they don't specifically ask about school resource officers. We will review the ACPS threat assessment reports from last year. We will send a survey out to students grades six through 12 tomorrow, asking them about their level of comfort with school resource officers and their experiences.  We have already asked for principal input about their experience with school resource officers, and we will provide a research brief from Dewey Cornell, who is a professor in the career school at UVA, who is known for his research on youth violence and school security. We've also reached out to EAB for a quick turnaround research request on program outcomes of school resource officer programs, and have various other studies, articles, and applicable ACPS policies for your review.  So today we have presented the items for the program review. June 26, we will present the complete information for the board's review.",

    "text": "So thank you, Jamie. So also, in addition to the work that we're doing, one of the things we do plan to work with the board on is structuring a resolution.  So that, for example, we have, Mr. Holden showed me a resolution that a board recently developed to make decision to alter their relationship with their police department. And what they did is they structured it as a resolution that provided their, you know how like when you make a resolution, it starts with the reasons for  why you're doing what you're doing. And then also it provides a step-by-step understanding of how that relationship is going to be undone or redone, reconsidered, altered in some way. So it spells out the particulars of the change so that your constituents understand the change that you're making in pieces. And also the board has a clear understanding  of what's changing and what's not changing and why that's occurring. So what we wanna do as we've done, I think we had a very successful budget process this year, although it ended with us going into a recession. But the reason I think it was successful was because we worked transparently and worked back and forth with the board to get to where you wanted to get in the decision-making process  and it became very clear to everyone what the decision was gonna be. So we're hoping that by July 9th, that through the direction of the board, we'll be able to present a resolution to you that can be put in front of you by the chair, and then looking for a motion to support that resolution for the change. To me, it's like a breadcrumb trail.  that you're laying out into your decision so that it's not just a yes or a no or not just we're gonna undo this, but we haven't really made any kind of considerations for what the undoing looks like or how it's gonna be structured. So that's what our hope is to be able to put that in front of you.",

And I would like to respectfully request that we do so.  I think there's a lot that could be said about it and probably more eloquently by some of our other board members. But just from my role as an assistant city attorney, I can say that I don't think we're escaping any kind of liability by not taking action when we already effectively are banning it through our superintendent. And we're opening ourself up to a lot of optics problems and beyond optics.  We're sending a message to our students. It's really easy to resolve since we already are not allowing students to wear Confederate imagery. And I think it's time that we make a resolution and move on. So I don't think we can make a motion at this meeting for something like that, although I am confused because we did make a motion for the holiday at the beginning.

So also, I would say that Ross and Bernard have been kicking around based on the conversations that you all had at the last meeting, that they've been doing some work on possible revision to our policy around student behavior, which is that's where the dress code comes from.  we could bring back a draft. The one thing that I wanted to be clear about is in the banning process, like when you say you want to ban a particular thing, is it just specifically going to be banning Confederate imagery? Or are you looking more toward what I had presented to the board last year  It wasn't stated, it stated I think essentially that there was a, as part of something that's disruptive, it was included in that Confederate imagery and some other things as well. So that's one thing I'm interested to know. Is it specifically the Confederate flag? Is it Confederate imagery? Is it, you know, to what extent would you want to be specific? Am I asking that the right way, Ross?",
