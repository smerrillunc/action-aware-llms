    "text": "And I'm Graham Page, Samuel Miller district.  a brief intro for our meeting this afternoon.  Since March of 2020, Albemarle County Public Schools have faced unprecedented challenges in accomplishing its mission of establishing a community of learners and learning through relationships, relevance, and rigor, one student at a time. Our students, staff, and families have adapted to these challenges and changes with creativity, flexibility, and perseverance. Our teachers have continued to provide our students with a world-class education virtually.  Our students have worked to master new skills on new learning platforms. Our families have helped to facilitate their children's virtual learning, becoming tech troubleshooters and tutors in addition to maintaining their normal day jobs. We remain grateful to them and proud of them for continuing their great work under difficult circumstances.  While managing education amidst the uncertainties of a pandemic, Albemarle County Public Schools have simultaneously fought in the battle to end the predictive value of race and ensure the success of each individual student and staff member during a period of social unrest in our community and society.  We have worked to eliminate the opportunity gap that exists in our division so that we can eradicate it and build a system that works for everyone in our strong and diverse community of learners. This work will help us all learn to understand difference and respect and champion the diverse life experiences of all members of our community.  We are so grateful to the Virginia General Assembly for its support for public education both over the years, and doing the 2020 special session. We have seen how you make public education, a large part of the conversations that you have around legislation and funding.  We know that you have made schools a priority during the pandemic crisis, and we have worked to do our part in keeping keeping our county public school community strong as we push through this unusual moment in time.  A lot is being done to keep our county families strong. Our transportation and child nutrition departments have taken advantage of an FDA waiver that allows the county schools to deliver meals to our students. Every day, 7,000 meals are delivered to over 3,500 students by 62 buses. This ensures that our students have nutritious meals and an opportunity to engage with their schools.  We've established a COVID-19 hotline that would allow us to provide any available resources to those in need during the pandemic. We're also expanding our mental health services, including training members of our staff in mental health first aid, so that we can help lift the emotional burden that COVID has caused in our community.  Our extended day enrichment program mobilized to create a child care program for county employees, public school employees. Currently, there are more than 40 students enrolled in this program, and we are extending it as we further hope our school doors open to accommodate more of our employees.  Over 1,000 hotspots have been provided to our students and employees in order to facilitate virtual learning for those who do not have reliable internet. These were provided at no cost to recipients.  Our anti-racism policy steering committee has implemented a book study on Glenn Singleton's courageous conversations about race for our school board and leadership team members. This work will help us ensure that our educators can help the division eliminate the predictive value of race in our school division.  Our four items in our 2021 legislative packet is aligned with all of these programs and with the work our division is doing. My colleagues will now speak on the subject of each of these four. We'll start with Mr. Alcaro, who will lead the discussion on social justice. Mr. Alcaro.",

    "text": "Thank you, Mr. Page.  And good afternoon, Senator Deeds and delegates Bell, Hudson and Runyon. Thank you for each of you making time for our annual meeting. I'm honored to be here with you today.  As you may be aware, our school board passed the first anti-racism policy in the Commonwealth of Virginia during the first quarter of 2019, following six plus months of discussion and design, much of it done by nine of our high school students. Implementation of this policy continues and will continue well into the future. This problem is certainly not a quick fix.  But Albemarle County School Board members are dedicated to have our school division provide equity for all of our students and all of our staff and be anti-racist to its core.  Over the last three months, as Mr. Page mentioned, our board has spent 10 and a half hours of professional development time engaged in discussion of courageous conversations about race at Glenn Singleton. I recommend courageous conversations about race to you highly. I also invite you all to read the book, Cast, by Isabel Wilkerson, if you haven't already.  It is sobering as well as educational, highly relevant to what's been mentioned so far, and you may find that it hits very close to home. In the Albemarle County School Board, we employ the Equity Checklist, which was developed by our Diversity and Equity Advisory Committee during 2018.  in not only the development of new policies for our school division, but monthly in the ongoing review of all of our policies that we are required to review and modify once every three to five years. I'll send a copy of this checklist to each of you at the end of my comments. I ask of you all that you look at your proposed bills in the upcoming session  and beyond through an equity lens. Does your bill and do the bills of your peers help all of the citizens and students of the Commonwealth of Virginia fairly and impartially, no matter their age, race, ethnicity, gender, or party affiliation? If they do, thank you for your caring,  and for your diligence. If not, what changes can be made in the bills that allow them to make it so? In every situation where equity is a primary factor in consideration of strategy, Virginia becomes a better place to live. Lastly, in our legislative agenda,  We ask that, quote, the General Assembly provide school divisions with additional funding needed to implement proven methods of preventing and addressing misbehaviors that lead to suspensions and expulsions, end quote. Our STEP, which stands for short-term education program, our STEP program is such a method.  The short description of this is that students who are suspended have the option to still attend school every day in a set-aside room away from their friends and receive specialized guidance and instruction to catch them up if needed and to keep them up to date with their classes so they don't fall behind their peers during their suspension. These numbers I think you'll find interesting.  Recidivism for suspended students who have gone through the STEP program has dropped from the pre-STEP level of 70% recidivism to 14% in the program's first year and 18% in the second year.  Our original budget for this present or current school year had included expanding STEP to all of our high schools and middle schools. Then COVID happened. There's a lot more to tell you about STEP and a lot of student stories that'll make your heart smile. But I must end here and ask for your funding of STEP. And I thank you for your time, for your attention, and for your consideration.  Mr. Page.",

I know that in particular, in this year, with so many students learning from home, that has meant that ensuring basic economic sustainability at home has also been, as always, a critical part of their education, but in a special way this year. My top two priorities are about evictions and unemployment checks from the VEC.  because we have had so many families disrupted and they don't have a home to study from. We also have a lot of folks who have lost their jobs and don't have the basic needs that they need to put food on those kitchen tables along with all those laptops and iPads. I really think that it's important now as ever to ensure the basic economic security of all of our families before they're sending their kids off to school.",

    "text": " Thanks very much, Chair Page. And as with all of these, they're very intertwined, as you all know, especially as legislators. And Delegate Hudson, I really wanted to appreciate what you said about ensuring that families have stable economics at home. Because I think that's so many things are tied that we don't think about. So I appreciate that.  I just want to introduce myself as my first meeting of this type. I'm Judy Lee. I joined the school board in January of this year. I also have a son who is a fifth grader in a county elementary school, so I've been able to see all of the virtual learning up close down the hall. And I appreciate the work that the division has done on that because I feel like he's gotten the best that has been possible at this time.  I also wanted to thank all of the legislators on this call for your efforts in restoring funds for education and focusing on mental health and broadband. We need these things now and we will need them going into the future.  In terms of the state budget, our biggest issue is retaining an ADM hold harmless for the biennium. And we do appreciate the hold harmless throughout this year and your support for it, very much so. But we, like so many other divisions, have lost students to homeschooling and private schools because of the pandemic. And because we fully expect those students to come back to us when this is over,  and for us to continue the growth that we had enjoyed prior to the pandemic, we need to be able to plan our funding numbers to reflect that and to reflect what we'll need to do when we welcome all those students back into our halls, as well as to reflect all the work that we've been trying to do prior to the pandemic.  As I said before, all of these issues that we're dealing with are intertwined with equity. You know, as Chair Page mentioned, as Mr. Alcaro mentioned, you know, we've been working hard here to close opportunity gaps in reading, in math, in gifted identification, in discipline and other areas. But we also know that the pandemic appears to have worsened these instructional gaps.  So after this very challenging year, we anticipate trying to catch up. And many of the ideas floated nationally to do that involve significant increases in teachers and teacher time. So I just, I wanted to ask the legislators here if you wouldn't mind telling me, has there been any discussion at the state level on how to fund that type of educational recovery? And in that recovery, what are your educational priorities?",

    "text": " Well, I guess I get to go first. I want to say that, particularly with school funding, it seems strange to be in an Albemarle school board meeting and not have Steve Colazar here. He was always the squeaky wheel that needed to be greased, particularly when it came up to funding.  We've got a huge number of catch-up jobs to do. I've really been worried. I've got a sister-in-law that's an elementary school principal in Bath County, and I've got a niece and nephew in schools over here. There are a lot of kids that are gonna be all right in this pandemic. They're all right with virtual learning, but the kids that I worry about are those that are learning to read, K through three kids.  and special education kids. Those are the children that need hands-on learning. They need to be in a classroom with someone who can keep their focus. And we've got a huge amount of catching up to do. Judy, I've not been involved in any of those conversations. I've never served on an education committee in the legislature.  I do serve on the Finance Committee, and one of our priorities is going to be to make sure that our schools, not only is there a whole armless part of the final budget that's passed, but that we take a good, long, hard look, a deep dive into what we need to allow schools to catch up and make sure that our kids  can regain the ground that I'm afraid they've lost. Unfortunately, I think some kids, that the losses are gonna be irretrievable. There's gonna be so much catch up. I'm not sure that we're gonna be able to do it all, but we have an obligation, it seems to me, to figure out how to make sure that we lose as few children as possible. And we've got to work extra hard over the next several years once we get past this pandemic.",

    "text": " Well, I'll speak next, I guess. I mean, I think that there were predictions that the virtual learning would exacerbate some of the equity issues you're describing. And they were pretty compelling predictions. But now the data is coming in, and they are reflecting just what you would think. I think most of you know my wife is a teacher's assistant up at Baker Butler. And the stories she brings home at night are consistent with what was seen in the  Virginia newspaper reports and the national newspaper reports which would be that the kids with a lot of support at home are able to somehow get through this and the kids who were most at risk at the beginning are the ones who are falling by the wayside and I'll just give an anecdote. It was the other day and she said that there was a she's she's with first graders and  they can't read. I mean, some can, but the ones that we're talking about can't. And so, for example, when she's trying to direct them to the page so that she can help with a lesson, the child has real trouble identifying the page from which she is then going to work, from which she is going to make the catch-up. And so you can see at the atomistic level the breakdown in equity we're describing, which would be with the parent that has a, excuse me, the kid that has a college-educated parent nearby who can say, no, honey, 120 means the one, the two, and the zero, and that's how you find the page.  and it's after page 119 and before page 121, that kid's just a little slower to get to the information that the student who spends the entire period unable to even find the page from which to work. And I'm hopeful, I assume that you guys have had meeting after meeting where the parents, teachers, assistants, staff are describing this. But in terms of a priority, I would hope that we would, I guess,  First, realistically, accurately, completely identify how much we lost here. I think we can be aspirational. We should say everybody's working as hard as they can. But again, all the data says there's a significant problem. And then that would be where I hope that the budget would direct its resources. I'm not part of the budget. Cree mentioned not being on the Education Committee. I've been on the Education Committee, and that's not where the money is. So that's much less important for the topics you're describing than  Senate Finance or the House Appropriations Committee. I'm on either, obviously, but thank you.",

    "text": "That might be a good spot for me to pick up as one of the most junior members who is not have a seat on either Senate Finance or Appropriations, but does have a seat on House Finance, which is where we talk about raising revenue to fund critical priorities. So from that lens, maybe I'll start by trying to say a few things that I hope are simple and non-controversial in this group.  That school funding is critical that Virginia lags behind other states in how much our state puts into our system, and that we've been asking too much of our localities for a long time, and I think the state has not been picking up its fair share.  We took big steps on the finance side last year to start to do better by that with the equal taxing authority legislation, which will make it easier for counties to raise revenue and I know that was a top priority for Albemarle County, but I think the reality is that that was just a first step, and that there are a number of things that we need to do  to fix the structural hole in our school funding in Virginia. I know we're going to see with everybody running for statewide office in the coming year, a lot of big conversations about big education plans and whether that's a billion dollars or $2 billion, it's going to be a big number and it should be because that's I think how far behind we are.  And I think that we're going to hear some comments about potential sources of revenue that could fill say a $2 billion hole. And we'll hear people talk about small options. People will talk about more gambling revenue from gray machines, and we'll hear people talk about  legalizing marijuana and cannabis taxes potentially. Those are potential sources of revenue and they're things that we should take seriously, but they're also too small relative to the size of the whole. We cannot raise enough money from the gambling and substance streams that people are discussing to put $2 billion behind our schools. If we want to be serious about that, and we should,  then we have a longer conversation to have about bigger picture structural tax reform in Virginia. I think that comes from three key sources, sales taxes, corporate taxes, and the personal income tax. And as a member of the Finance Committee, I am working hard to start those conversations. I know that I'm not the first to have them, but I am perhaps one of the more energetic folks who really sees that as a critical part of our work.  You know, we rely really heavily on sales taxes, also to fund state services, but sales taxes only apply to goods.  And right now we need to talk about potentially extending the sales tax base to cover personal services as well, so that if you buy a shampoo, you pay sales tax but if you go to the hairdresser you don't. Those are the kind of things that would have a more equitable consumption tax across Virginia, that would make it possible to raise the kind of money that it would take to fill the fund the kind of investments in our schools that people are talking about.  So that's just by way of saying, I'm glad that people are talking about major investments in our schools and that that will be front and center in a lot of our campaign conversations this year. I hope that we can also ensure that when we talk about those big numbers, we talk seriously about what it takes to put real money behind them. Because I think there are some items on the campaign trail that are good to talk about that are just too small in practice to really deliver on those promises.",

    "text": "Well, I'm not I'm not going to read my section. We greatly appreciate the work that you've done in the General Assembly to  increase support for mental health and mental health school counselors. But as you know, you have not fully funded your portion of that, and that would be very welcome. Mental health is an issue for one in five kids nationally, and I don't imagine we're any different. And that was before COVID. We have, you know, and as we all know,  Children's social and emotional health is critical to learning anything. And this has been extraordinarily stressful for a lot of our kids and their parents. We hear from a lot of them on a daily basis.  You might ask what in a virtual universe do our school counselors do? And I know at one of our elementaries, well, I did not tally all 25 of our schools. But at some of our schools, the guidance, the school counselors will pop on a regular course.  or classroom and say hello, making certain that the kids know who they are. And some of them, they do directed activities, such as learning how to categorize problems. This is a problem. Is it a problem with your classmate? Is it a small problem that you can do on your own? Here are some tools that you can handle that. When should you go and talk with an adult?  But some of the issues are related to what Miss Hudson was talking about in terms of poverty. One of the schools that I represent is for elementary, which has.  Two-thirds of its students are Black and Brown. 76% are eligible for free and reduced-cost lunches. It also has the highest percentage of English language learners. And in terms of teaching second graders how to hold a pencil or to find the lesson on a virtual screen, it's extraordinarily challenging.  The guidance counselors at Greer do everything from being the coordinators with the toy lift that we just happened, and explaining to some of our Muslim families that their kids can get toys for a Christian holiday, and if so, you know, where they can pick up the toys, and sometimes they make deliveries. They have worked, of course, in terms of  Child Protective Services, which everything that I have read and that is reported to me, it's much harder to detect when they're virtual and when they don't have privacy at home in terms of talking into their computer. But I would urge, A, that you continue to reduce the ratio of counselors to students toward what the American Academy of School,  the American School Counselors Association recommended ratio, and then fund, fairly fund your portion of that. I like with kids falling behind and needing a Marshall Plan for post-COVID education, I think mental health needs to be a critical part of that. Whatever we are looking at with our kids right now, it may be exacerbated by this  year of craziness. I don't know how to say it. I mean, in addition to our younger kids, we have some anguished letters and public comments from our high school athletes who are distraught that, you know, they can't continue their  sports during this period of time. Many of them, you know, are applying to schools and, you know, trying to get scholarships. But many of them, we had a very upset letter from a parent, I think it was this week, saying that we've ruined their kids. They're going to be a definitely going to be a high school dropout. I wonder about all the longer term consequences. And we need to have the mental health professionals in place  to deal with that. And I know, Cree, you and I went to a presentation at Monticello several years ago of students about mental health. And we at Albemarle are very proud that we have already, even before the changes to SOQs, been expanding our core of mental health professionals, but it's still not enough.",

    "text": " Yeah, and I think Rob had the same presentation, maybe at a different time. Those kids, though, have contributed to state law in a number of ways already. You know, what we've been trying to do the last few years is, you know, school counselors historically have been what's known as guidance counselors.  We need counselors that are prepared to meet the mental health needs of students, help students grow up, help students get ready for life, not necessarily find a job or the right college place, but we can do that other ways. Part of the good news yesterday with the governor's budget announcement was that he was going to restore the funding to reduce the ratio for school counselors.  Not enough, but it's the first step and it's an important step. I agree with you. We have to continue to focus on schools. One thing those kids from, the presentation was at Monticello, but the kids, there was actually a student from Western Albemarle and a student from Albemarle High School too. Part of what they did, and Rob and I carried the bills, was to introduce  mental health education into the health curriculum for eighth and ninth grade students. That's critically important in terms of reducing the stigma associated with mental health and also give kids the tools they need to recognize issues that might be first appearing among some of their peers along the way. This is a very important issue and I think we've begun  the roadway that's gonna allow us to break through and make kids' lives better. And you should be proud that a lot of that work started in Albemarle County and in particular in your schools. So congratulations on the good work, but we still have a long way to go.",

It's the Mental Health Ongoing Study Commission. And there's an issue that arose from Albemarle called the Therapeutic Day Treatment. It goes by TDT. And what happens is a counselor identifies a program which needs more intensive care than he or she can provide.  And they are then sent to the TTT program and there was a change in the way the program was run and there's that you might recall a big article in the Daily Progress. And this was the first service happening statewide but as sometimes happens somebody has to identify it first.  The administration swore that they now had eliminated that, that it's all fine, that other programs are taking the place. I am always skeptical. We just had that meeting. Can anybody tell me if it is, I mean, have the TDT rates gone back up or has an alternative equivalent program be put in place?  These are the when I've got one in my head that I'm visualizing from Baker Butler, but these are the kids that need more than an occasional check in with the counselor. This is literally where they do some triaging and identify.  Can anyone share? Maybe I don't want to put you on the spot if you'd like. Maybe someone else can.",

And we said, huh, that's not at all what we are hearing from region 10 or from the local schools or the local counselors. And it's not just Albemarle, this was, Flavan and Green had similar issues. And I was skeptical and said I would check with our local people and see if what you're describing that it's been taken care of is actually coming out in the wash all the way down to the tip of the spear.  If I hear you that it's not then what my ask would be would be if someone could just do a by whatever metric is fair don't I'm not asking for something that makes it look more or less than it is, but how many kids were being serviced. I was easiest by quarter by month by year but  If there is an appreciable fall off and no equivalent program that is now catching those kids, I don't, they haven't been magically cured.

I feel like I have used to see so many of you guys in passing at events like Delegate Bell at graduation and Sally Hudson dancing in a reindeer costume on the side of the street, but maybe next year.  I the last topic which it sounds like I know I came late to this meeting, but it sounds like we were already doing some discussion around the budget is just about the generalized teacher shortage delegate Hudson I heard you speak about teacher pay and how we we tend to lag behind other states, I think we're 3033 out of the nation in terms of what we pay our teachers and we would just like to.  to push you guys how important it is to pay our teachers well and pay them competitively, so that we can continue to recruit teachers, I used to be a teacher myself. delegate bells wife is a teacher they they honestly are making doing all the hard work you know when we talk about things it's really the relationship you build with your teacher and having good teachers is important.  So also, I'll put in my personal little thing, which is that we've made a really big push recently to have more diversity in our teacher hires. It's something that's been proven effective in terms of narrowing the achievement gap, and it's really hard to do. It's hard to recruit teachers at the current pay scale. Does anyone else have anything they would like to add? I mean, it's a pretty short list. Just give us more money.",

And his big idea that that helped get him elected was let's raise our teacher pay to the national average.  Well, none of us want our children to be average that always always always bothers me that we our goal is to be average, you know, we ought to be the best school system in the country we ought to aspire to produce the best the most qualified graduates.  And here's the thing, it is about money. Sally Hudson and I were involved in a conversation last night with another group. And at the end of the day, it's about money. It's about coming up with a new way to generate the revenue because the old ways just don't work. Here's the thing.  Arlington, Fairfax County, you know, the average teacher pay is $90,000 and that sounds like that sounds great, but you go across the river to the next county over Montgomery County average teacher pay is $100,000. How in the world can even the best paying jurisdictions in Virginia compete when their neighbors pay so much more?  We've got to figure this out. We've got to figure it out and it's going to take real hard work and people are going to have to make decisions about things that they don't really want to have to face. But the reality is if we are going to be the best we can be, if we're going to provide the best environment for our children to grow up, we're going to have to make those decisions. And I think we might have some choices as early as this year if we're going to move forward.",

And so I just hope that, you know, I know all of us here are deeply committed to that work and that I hope we will support our communities in really trying to pin people down and make sure that they sketch out how they're going to do it and then make them deliver once they're in office.",

I confess if I'm going dollar for dollar and I have to choose between raising pay and doing loan forgiveness, I would rather just raise pay because it just maximizes flexibility of the person being paid. They can use it to pay down debt if they want. And if they have other priorities like paying for a mortgage or buying that first car, they can do it. And I just think it takes the burden off the state of administering that loan forgiveness program.  I think, especially at the federal level, we have seen loan forgiveness programs offered, you know, for years and remarkably low take up rates or people who can successfully navigate all of the hurdles of getting those loans delivered. And so, from my perspective, I'm not sure that it's worth the headache of administering the program that pays you back for one and only one thing if we could put those dollars, dollar for dollar into just raising wages, but that's sort of my take.",

For example, years ago, we identified real needs in every area of mental health provider, from counselor, to licensed clinical social worker, to psychologist, to psychiatrist. And we found plans that worked in other states built around loan forgiveness.  We've tried to get those things funded and we just haven't had success doing that. The shortages of workforce are very real in that area. And that's just one instance where we've tried this before and we haven't been able to convince people to fund it. So it's worth exploring.

We do a really good job, but I know that we pull teachers from rural areas where they don't pay as well. I know my mom used to work in Stafford. She now draws all the way up to Alexandria from Fredericksburg to work there. And she's an experienced veteran teacher.

Counties like Bath, where I live, we get our teachers from West Virginia, because we pay more than West Virginia. But nearly everybody else in the state pays more than we do. So our teachers, unless they have some connection to Bath County, they stay here a few years.  and then move on. And they move up to the Augustas, and then they move to the Albemorals, and then they move to the Prince Williams, and Henricos, and Loudons, and Fairfaxes eventually, I guess. It's a feeder system.

    "text": " Yes, good afternoon board members, Pat McLaughlin chief of strategic planning, and I'm here with my Akuma Zawa to to lead you through our work session today. And we've really got three parts of this work session that we're going to work through. The first is going to spend a little bit of time thinking back to Dr Haas's presentation from last month to unpack the state of the division report.  Then around five o'clock, we're going to hear a little bit about our budget assumptions and expenditure considerations. And then finally, we're going to have some board discussion and breakout groups around budget priorities for the coming fiscal year.  So just to frame up a little bit, why do we talk about the state of the division and the budget at the same time and really it's because we've got a cyclical process that we've that we've started over the past couple of years. So it all kind of begins with the budget, and each year the board puts together a budget and within their list the priorities and the goals that they have for the division.  And recently we've started using that budget document to directly help inform our school improvement and our department improvement plans. So when you take a look at those. You should see, for example, every department in the budget has outlined some kind of some things that they're looking ahead to in the future in that budget, and you should see how they're going to put those into practice in their department improvement plans.  At the end of that school year, the departments report back to us and that report becomes the state of the division. And the state of the division looks at what's working well for us, but it also highlights some areas where we could continue to use some improvement. And that should then start the next cycle where we go back to the budget and start to think about what are the programs that we want to continue and what programs might need some additional support or be abandoned or, you know, what makes the most sense  in terms of our fiscal priorities for the year. And so today, we're gonna spend a bit of time unpacking the State of the Division. You heard a pretty comprehensive report on the State of the Division last month from Dr. Haas, and we're gonna just use that to kind of prime the pump a little bit and refresh our memories to really go into the heart of our work today, which is around the budget priorities.  And so if you recall the state of the division report is pretty comprehensive it's it's about 70 plus pages long. And so we clearly won't have won't have time to read through the whole thing. But I would, what I would encourage you to do when we do our first activity is take a look at the table of contents what stands out to you is it the equity report is it human resources is it reports from our individual departments that you want to take a look at.  And we are going to open up a jam board for you all if you remember that those are those boards where you can move.  some post-it notes back and forth. And the first thing that we want you to do is just individually take a look at the state of the division and start identifying areas in the state of the division that you think are strengths for the division, what we're doing well, weaknesses, areas where we could improve, opportunities, what are some trends that are out there right now that we could take advantage of, and what are some threats to the division meeting our goals.  While you're reading through that, and you and you identify those strengths and weaknesses and opportunities and threats, write a post it note and post it on the jam board and put it into the correct quadrant.  up on the board, you'll see that you've got the link to the state of the division report, and this is what your jam boards going to look like, just to remember you're all going to be working off of the same one. And there's going to be multiple pages to this board that you can get to up here, the rest of the pages pages two through five are going to be a second activity that we do with Miss kumizawa when she comes on  for her part, but just to remember to add a sticky note, you click over here on the sticky note icon, you type your message that you want in there, and then you click Save, it'll appear on the board, and you can move it all around. You can change colors. I know we've got some board members who really like to personalize and put their own colors on there.  For this activity, I'm going to ask you to keep them all yellow, because in the second part, we're going to do a group activity where the colors are going to become more important. So for 10 minutes, take a look at the State of the Division. And I will drop our presentation for today into the chat in just a second. And you can access the State of the Division through that presentation. There's a link there. And you can access the Jamboard through that link.  Stop sharing my screen for a second so I can get this into the chat. I'll put a direct link into the jam boards to that first link is the state of the division. The second link will take you to the jam board. And I'll go ahead and put the state of the division link in there too, just to make things easy. And then the third link.  is the state of the division. And so I'm going to step back. It's 436. We'll go until about 446. I'll put the jam board up so that everyone who's tuned into the meeting can see what you're putting on there. But your charge over the next 10 minutes is to identify a few strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.",

    "text": " So one more minute to add any strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats you'd like.  All right, so I'm going to bring you back together for a few minutes. Thank you for for jumping in there looks like we've got a lot of ideas to work with. We've got one very threatening bunny that that made its way on to the to the board as well that will will deal with.  in short order. So clearly that's not a comprehensive list that we created in 10 minutes, but it's a good start. And it's very interesting. We did a similar exercise with our strategic planning design group the other night. And I see a lot of similarities too with what you're identifying with what they identified there as well. And so for the next step, we really want the board to work together.  on this and start thinking about what are the, of the threats and weaknesses that were identified and of the strengths and opportunities that were identified, what are the most important for you all to be considering as you start to have a conversation around the budget? In other words, if we could identify some threats and weaknesses, that if we got rid of those, if we took out those barriers, which ones would have the most impact on improving the student experience?  Same thing for the threats, the strengths and the opportunities. What is it that's working well right now, where if we expanded on it, or, or use those ideas in a, in a more expansive way. What would improve the learning experience for our students, the most.  And so this is where we get to play with the colors a little bit. What we're going to ask you to do is, as a board, start talking through those. And as you come to consensus around which are most important for the board to be focusing on in the future, open up that sticky note and turn it blue. And we'll keep the notes that turn blue. We'll just give us an indication that that's what  Rose up to the top of that conversation and that's something you can keep in mind as Maya takes us through some of the budget work that we're doing. So we're going to give about 15 to 20 minutes to to do this work. And again, I'm going to step back, but I think, feel free on board members should feel free to open up their mics.  I'll have the Jamboard up for everyone who's viewing to see, and you all can have some conversation with each other around that. And I'll be listening in the background. I'm happy to jump into the notes, and if you find one that you want to turn a different color, I can go in and take care of that. Also, if during the course of your conversation, you say, hey, we really should have put this up, feel free to continue to add to the board. So we'll take, it's 448 right now, we'll take until,  a little after five o'clock, maybe 505 to go through this. So I'm going to step into the background and let you all have some conversation around that.",

But it's a start, you know, we've talked about doing this for a while. And so this was  really year one for for collecting that we hope that builds into a bigger source of feedback for us in the future. One of the things that's interesting to note about that one of the questions we asked our seniors who just graduated are, are you interested in working for Albemarle County Public Schools, and we had about six or seven say yeah please contact me so we're working on some  some reach out to them to build some relationships and, and they kind of run the gamut of the different departments, they want to work in so.

I'm hopeful that that will be reflected soon in narrowing some of those reading gaps and the PALS assessments, picking up more students.

    "text": " Great. Thanks, Pat. And good evening, everyone. For the budget portion for this evening, we've outlined some three high-level goals. They are to review and provide feedback on budget strategies in order to give us direction for a proposed funding request in February, and also to address school board concerns and questions. Many of these goals align with those of the Budget Advisory Committee. So we have invited some members here tonight who  I will introduce to you a little bit later. Also, just a reminder that this meeting is just the first budget input meeting out of future ones. And as you know, we've built in a little bit of extra time this year. The proposed funding requests will be presented in February. So there will be time, especially in January, to continue providing your feedback.  I thought I would start off with an enrollment projection for next year. As you know, this has an impact on both the revenue and the expenditure side. The last few months, we've worked closely with a lot of stakeholders, including principals, the Weldon Cooper Center, the Long Range Planning Advisory Committee, and the leadership to develop an enrollment projection in an unprecedented year where we really  have a lot of uncertainty, but we have landed on something that there's pretty much consensus on, and that is an enrollment of 14,000 students for next year. That's the blue line that you see. The yellow dots over the years you can see is our actual enrollment, and the current year we are using a September 30th enrollment of 13,200 students. I've also added an orange dot kind of at the top  to show that was our projection. So last year at this time, we were projecting growth to 14,200 students. And that growth was only going to continue from there. Our projection in the blue of 14,000 is in line with what Walden Cooper has projected for us as well. And it is a sort of a middle ground. And yes, we will expect to see students returning, but not all. And that's what that represents.  Next, I'll move over to our preliminary revenue forecast. Currently, we're anticipating no revenue increase in the local transfer. And so far this year, the projected local revenues have been on track with what's been budgeted. And right now, there's been really not a lot of new information to really look at any increases for next year.  In January, though, after the real estate assessments, we will have a local revenue forecast that will turn into a local transfer for us. So this number may change in mid to late January. On the state side, we have just recently received the governor's proposed budget for the current biennium. And it is a very positive proposed budget  that we are excited about. We do anticipate based on that proposed budget, I mean, there's still a lot of time between now and by the time it's adopted, but based on that budget, we anticipate seeing about a $5 million increase from the adopted 21 budget to next year's budget. The proposed budget by the governor does include a revision for the current year, as well as projections for the next year. So this increase is not  is not an increase from what we're projecting for this year, but rather what was adopted back in the spring. So that's mostly what this large increase is made up of. As back in the spring, we made some pretty conservative projections about the economy. So about over a little over $2 million of the increase will come from SOQ funding, which includes sales tax revenues.  A little bit under 1 million will come from lottery revenues. And then a little over a million dollars we're expected to see from a hold harmless or a no loss funding. If we base our other revenue streams from the enrollment projection that I just shared with you. There are a few other revenues that we'll see in the school fund, federal revenues and local school earned revenues.  We will probably be projecting lower local school revenues as there are a lot of programs that have been put on hold due to the pandemic. And we are still working through those, but those will not be lowered in any significant way. Switching over to the expenditure side, we've categorized how we're looking  So far, preliminarily, how we're looking at expenditures into these categories. They aren't too different from what you've seen in the past. They're slightly different. As you can see, there's a lot of restoration instead of future growth. I'll go from left to right and briefly describe each of these expenditure considerations so that you have a better understanding of them. First, in the non-discretionary column, every year we have a baseline adjustment.  This is an adjustment, it's typically a savings to account for who's on board now. So the employees who were on our payroll last year have changed between last year at this time to this year. And typically this is a savings because we have new employees on board and typically they're paid at slightly lower rates than those last year because those highest paid employees are retiring. We do anticipate the savings to be  a little bit more than usual, just because we have seen more retirements than we have in past years. We also anticipate seeing a health care rate increase of a significant amount. This is because we did not budget for an increase in plan year 2021, which is the same as calendar year 2021. But we did see an increase in the health care rate in plan year 2021.  Coupled with a potential rate increase in plan year 2022, this will impact our fiscal year 22 budget, and we will have to budget an increase. And then finally, voluntary early retirement incentive program rates, those may increase as well. As I mentioned, we have seen higher rates of retirement during this year. Our next category is operational restoration.  During our revised budget process for FY21, we had to make a lot of reductions. These are all in detail in your FY21 adopted budget. And I still have copies of those if anyone still wants to receive them for reference. We reduced our annual transfer to the Learning Resources Fund. We cut 15 operational positions, both department and instructional.",

    "text": "These could be considered to be restored for the next budget. We also have a category called instructional restoration. As you may recall, we changed our class size ratios in order to accommodate our reduced revenues for the current adopted budget. So this restoration would restore  our ratios of how we allocate FTEs to students. And then we would also restore the special education teacher growth that we were originally planning last year and the ESOL teacher growth that we were originally planning that had to be cut. The next category is compensation, and we have three general categories under that.  One option under compensation is to continue moving forward on the minimum pay rate. Um, this was in order to move last year, we were talking about moving, um, the division to a $15 minimum pay rate, and, um, it came with a pretty large, uh, price tag. But before the pandemic, we were, um, we had enough projected revenues to cover that. Unfortunately, that, um, proposal was taken off the table. Um, so it could be a  possibility to phase into that as much as we could. This next bullet is a small, tiny sliver, less than $100,000, really, to make an administrative change and also to benefit some of our part-time employees. This is to provide health insurance benefits for part-time employees who are 0.5s to 0.69s to a benefit level of 0.7, to sort of band them together to provide them a little bit of a better  health insurance benefit. And we already do this for part-time employees who are 0.7s to 0.99s. They receive health insurance benefits at a rate of a full-time employee. And then finally, of course, we have salary increase for both teachers and classifieds. That would be up for consideration in next year's budget. The last column is new proposals. And this is really just a section of proposals that don't  fit into the other categories. So these are new items that may be considered during the budgeting process. We have a couple here listed already, but again, this is very preliminary and this evening might be a chance to continue adding or asking questions about any proposals we might have. And we'll have plenty of time to talk through these in your breakout groups.  But before we jump into the breakout groups, I wanted to introduce our Budget Advisory Committee. This is a group that was pulled together a couple of years ago by Dr. Haas in order to analyze, evaluate, and advise the superintendent and division staff regarding budgeting practices and priorities from a business perspective. The committee is comprised of business professionals with significant budgeting experience.  Since, as I mentioned, a lot of the goals of this committee align with the goals of this session, Dr. Haas has invited some of them to join you tonight. So if Julian, Gerard, and Paul could turn on your cameras and say a quick hello and introduce yourselves, that would be great.",

It seems to me like the driving premise of this has got to be to, and I see under proposals, learning recovery. There's been a gap that's been widened this year. Not everyone has been able to learn remotely. And I just think the disparities are just going to be amplified. And so to me, it's like, which of these operational instruction or compensation is going  or is it a special program that's gonna address the gap that happened? Then secondarily, with COVID, it has just been highlighted to the country, the disparities, and as a healthcare provider, it's been really highlighted on that, but I've also read a lot about the disparities in education that have been highlighted by COVID.  So moving forward, especially if there's a brief amount of windfall, how are we gonna use that money to address the ongoing gaps?

So they're not off in another solar system from where you are. The conversation we had with the budget advisory team this afternoon, whose members attended tonight, and I really appreciate you all  hanging around and joining those conversations. And it was very valuable. But the conversation we had with that team was aligned with what we're talking about. We had a project management oversight committee meeting today to look at one project for the coming year. And that is COVID recovery with equity.  and the conversation we have at the staff level with the cabinet and the project management oversight team was the same conversation that we're having. Everyone in all three of the groups that I joined, you talked about different ways of going about tackling the key themes, but the themes are really coalescing and are the same.  From my position, watching that happen and then knowing that we were gaining a great deal of input from the school board prior to.  of bringing a spending plan at the end of January and early February, it really helps me have a great deal of confidence in knowing what your priorities are and what you would like us to do. And it becomes much less, we used to talk about, oh, this is, first it's the superintendent's budget, then it's the board's budget, then it's the super, no, it's not. From the beginning, it's our spending plan working on it together. And I really appreciate your input.  These conversations were in depth. You know your school system. You're really starting to get that foundation of knowledge that a great board has to make really solid decisions for Albemarle County Schools. So thank you very much for the work you did tonight.
