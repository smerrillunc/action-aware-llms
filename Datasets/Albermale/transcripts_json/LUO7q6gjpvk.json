And then that will be formally presented to the board of supervisors during the March 14th  Board of Supervisors work session. Here's our agenda for this evening. It focuses on our remaining proposals and also requested updates from you all. We again have a great group of staff who will present and answer any questions you have in their areas. We've also scheduled in a break if you choose to do so. And then at the end, we've set aside some time for a school board discussion to discuss all three of the work sessions.  Also, as a recap, each of our new proposals is guided by a logic model in the budget document. You can follow along the page numbers in the top right corner of each slide. And we have four primary components in these logic models. Inputs, activities, outputs, and outcomes. Inputs and activities ensure we follow through and fully implement the proposals, and outputs and outcomes represent success measures.",

And tonight I will be giving some more information with regard to the proposed budget for health services, which is really an implementation of staffing standards for our school nurses and our health services program.  So I do think it's worth noting, as you have in the past and have recognized the incredible efforts that our school nurses have provided to keep our schools, children, families, and staff safe, on the left here, I've outlined some of their traditional responsibilities.  And then on the right. I want to make it clear that because of the pandemic. These are not new responsibilities that took the place of the old there in addition to which really highlights the just tremendous.  responsibility and tasks that our school nurses have provided for our schools during this pandemic. But it's done a number of things. One is really highlighted, we're at a point where I think this is a very timely proposal for staffing standards for our school nurses and the need for some really directed leadership in this area. So what we're  proposing is to first recognize and thank you, the school board, for establishing our current state, which is a full-time school nurse at each school building. That was huge. And I think in our evolution, we're at a place now in this proposal where we're looking at staffing standards because the current state is also a small elementary school is staffed at the same level as a comprehensive high school with regard to a school nurse.  And this proposal is a phased-in project that begins with a full-time coordinator of nursing and health services. We have learned through the pandemic, which currently we have a COVID coordinator, Eileen Gomez, that is paid through or by federal funding associated with the pandemic.  But we recognize that our previous model where we had a full-time nurse at the school and who had additional responsibilities for leadership and some administrative duties really needed to be addressed. We believe that having a coordinator for nursing and health services will address many of the areas that we're looking to improve and provide equity across our schools and to our children at all levels.  And then specifically with regard to school nurses, we're looking to roll out these staffing standards, beginning with an additional school nurse at Albemarle High School for this upcoming fiscal year. And then as you can see, I broke out a long-term plan where fiscal year 24 would have additional three FTEs of school nurses to round out the staffing standards at the high school level.  fiscal year 25 to round out the middle and elementary schools according to the staffing standard, which I wanna point out is based on the National Association of School Nurses that propose 750 well students per school nurse. So we use that and I also used the enrollment projections that we have access to that are online.  And then, so fiscal year 26, there's no change. We'd have our staffing standards fully implemented. And then just a heads up, fiscal year 27, if enrollment continues as is, there may be an adjustment needed to our middle schools with an additional FTE. That's how the staffing standard would roll out. But I did want to review for you what would be the outputs and outcomes.  So on the next slide, our outputs would be, we would establish data points.  to collect with regard to Albemarle High School in particular, beginning in September of 22. We would then have collected those data points and analyze them using the other high schools as a control group just to see the impact that the additional services and supports have made on Albemarle High School. That would be collected and analyzed by December of 22.  And then the third output would be the compilation of best practices. We're going to start to look at procedures, practices, and recommendations as we scale up at the high schools, because this is new. Our school nurses worked solo in our schools. And to work as a team, we really want to delineate responsibilities and the most effective and efficient methodology in delivery of our health services.  The outcomes would be an alignment and accomplishment of expectations with regard to documentation and health screenings across  our schools, but in particular for this project at Albemarle High School. And then at Albemarle High School in particular, again, we'd be taking some job satisfaction data from our school nurses. Our belief is that, yeah, by providing additional supports based on the number of students in the building, we should see higher rates of job satisfaction. We want to retain our school nurses and have a very positive place for them to work.  That is a summary of the staffing standard initiative as part of the proposed budget. I don't know if you wanted to entertain any questions now, but I'm open to that.",

I do believe that, yeah, there are some schools that aren't a full,  to 1,500, that we would have some utility for additional coverage, teaming, especially in geographical areas.

It was approved in the budget for the 2021 school year, but was removed due to the uncertainties around COVID. In the past several years, the school board has focused on removing student fees. There's one fee that continues for many of our students, and it's the cost surrounding field trips. Next slide, please.  For the purposes of this proposal, we have included both field trips and experiences brought into the school. So we're calling them field experiences. To date, field experiences have been left to individual grade levels in schools. With this proposal, field experiences will be developed for each grade level, two per year, and designed to touch multiple content areas over the course of a student's K-12 experience.  In addition to providing all the associated costs for the experiences, this proposal seeks to provide lesson plans. These experiences will strengthen observational skills, increase knowledge and understanding by using hands-on experiences, make cross-curricular connections, and expand awareness of our communities and future career opportunities. We believe by adding these opportunities to our curriculum frameworks and our pacing guides, we will guarantee these types of learning for all our students and all of our schools.  Next slide. This slide shares some of the identified outcomes and outputs for this proposal. After each experience, we will check for key understandings from students and seek feedback from all involved to enhance and make the experiences better in the future. Any questions?",

We have not added a new school to our division in 20 years and more growth is planned in the county.  As an update, last week, the County Executive released the recommended FY23 budget, which includes the recommended five-year CIP. These are the projects that are proposed to be funded over the next five years. High school capacity, the construction of one elementary school, and the design of a second elementary school.

    "text": "Good evening school board. My name is Jamie Foreman, Deputy Chief Technology Officer for the Department of Technology. Thank you for the opportunity to share information about our technology replacement program tonight.  The ACPS Department of Technology operates a replacement cycle for specified technology systems and devices. Our replacement cycle has effectively been in place for a number of years and has developed such that it best supports our department's mission statement to empower all members of our learning community by providing exceptional technology solutions and support that results from collaborative decision-making and effective timely support. Next slide, please. Our division strategic plan reinforces the need to have an effective and robust  replacement program. Strategic plan objective three, provide resources in an equitable manner that transforms learning experiences and opportunities for all students. Strategy 3.3.6, ACPS will ensure each K-12 learning space, teacher and student has established baseline digital resources for effective instruction and learning. Our digital learning environment is based on the optimal functioning of complex machines and programs that require up-to-date equipment and timely support. Digital security also requires up-to-date equipment  and the data network maintained in a secure manner as possible. Given the fact that ransomware attacks on school divisions are on the rise, the continued funding of our replacement cycle is now more critical than ever. Next slide, please. To maintain our replacement program moving forward, our department's operating budget will need to cover annual replacement costs for student devices, desk phones, and security cameras to align with local government's redefinition for the spending of operating versus capital funds.  For next fiscal year, this will require an increase of 1.8 million to our operating budget. While this requires a shift to our budgetary approach, we see this as an opportunity for the school division to better support the replacement program fiscally. To date, we've struggled to maintain our replacement program as the CIP funds we've been provided have remained constant over the past decade. The continued systematic replacement of student devices  test phones and security cameras in combination with our talented, hardworking staff and accompanying support structures will continue to allow us to make sure students, teachers, and staff have the devices and resources they need to meet the instructional and operational needs of the school division. Next slide, please. In grades pre-K through second, we have an iPad to student ratio of one to one. In grades three through 12, we have a laptop to student ratio of one to one. In addition to the replacement program, guaranteeing that we have a safe,  secure and reliable technology, it also provides us an approach to achieving digital equity in our school division. To us, digital equity means we partner with our school communities to provide each student access to safe, appropriate learning experiences and resources supported by technology and essential to their success. We believe each staff member's teacher and student should have access to the technology they need to be successful regardless of where they attend school or work. And thank you again for this opportunity, and I welcome any questions you have at this time.",

Another one we really work on is hotspots in areas where a family may have cellular kind of service working with that family if they don't have internet at home to gain access to hotspot that we provide and pay for that they can use to have connectivity at home.

We'll focus on illustrating the impact of new and renovated spaces and also show some traditional spaces to compare them to. We'll start at Albemarle High School. Here you'll see a locker removal project that gives you more space in the hallway and also gives an interesting space for students to gather.  We're looking here at a traditional classroom at Albemarle High School. You'll see traditional furniture, you'll see some more traditional spaces. And here we're looking at a renovated space at Albemarle High School. You'll see flexible furniture, some additional daylighting, and you'll see a lot of different ways a teacher can configure the room.  Here's a traditional space that was a science classroom. We have storage issues in the space. We can bring in some additional daylighting to give them some more light in the classroom and some spaces that aren't used as they originally were intended. Here we're looking at a renovated science room. At Albemarle High School you'll see a lot of different abilities for teachers to configure the room in different spaces and for students to have more choice in their seating.  You'll see lots of light and lots of space. You'll see easy access to utilities such as gas and outlets. We're at Jewett Middle School now to look at a few examples of renovated versus traditional spaces. We'll start in a traditional classroom. You'll see a traditional layout for desks, which is partially COVID inspired. And in the new space, this is the tech lab that combined different classrooms into one common space. Students are able to spread out in different configurations. We have flexible furniture that can be moved into different places.  Here we're at Jewett's modernized tech lab. You'll see lots of flexible configurations for the students to work with. You'll see a lot of light. There's a space where students can work in the shop area versus more of a clean space. And we have lots of technology in the space such as 3D printers and laser cutters that students can experiment and learn with.  Now we'll focus on some of our larger modernization projects and give you some additional details. At Red Hill, we designed to modernize and newly furnish 13 classrooms and the media center. Work in the classrooms included updated finishes, casework, and lighting as needed from room to room.  improved transparency and connection to adjacent spaces and the outdoors was very important in this project. The furniture was updated to create a flexible and comfortable learning environment, including ergonomic seating choice, work surfaces that vary in height and size, but are all mobile and provide adequate storage. At Woodbrook Elementary, we added about 40,000 square feet.  With that 40,000 square feet, we added 300 seats, bringing the school's capacity to 600 students. The addition included 16 classrooms, two dedicated special ed classrooms, four smaller resource classrooms, a maker space, professional development training space, a conference room, two faculty work rooms, and toilets, offices, storage, and various support spaces. Smaller additions expanded the cafeteria and a new gym were constructed.  This learning space modernization budget touched on many different school spaces. It added needed improvements to instructional spaces that included existing classrooms, libraries, and other elective and support areas that are consistent with the school board's goals and priorities. Modifications included furniture and renewal work, including updated finishes, casework, lighting, and connections to adjacent spaces.  Typical modifications included classroom furniture upgrades, classroom modernization, media center modernization, cafeteria modernization, specialty classroom modernization, and additional day lighting.  Western Albemarle High School's Environmental Studies Academy consisted of two phases. The first phase included the Environmental Studies Academy's standalone building, which includes the greenhouse, and phase two was an academy addition and science lab modernization. The addition is about 10,000 square feet and focused on expanded science facilities to accommodate the Environmental Science Academy programs.  This included three labs, offices, a shared prep room with storage, and project spaces for independent and collaborative teaming. Spaces also accommodated hydro and aquatic activities and hydroponics. Seven of the existing classrooms in the building were also modernized, which included replacing casework, updating finishes and lighting, improving daylighting, and adding additional power and replacing furniture.  The most recent work at Red Hill Elementary was phase two of the project. It included an addition, renovations, and site improvements. The project added about 6,500 square feet to the building with a new gymnasium and support spaces such as physical education offices and storage.  Renovations to the existing building included repurposing the previous gym into the new media center. The new media center is a creative learning space with new shelving, finishes, and collaboration spaces. Renovations to the cafeteria, toilets, hallways, and support spaces, and kitchen and serving line were also part of this project. Exterior renovations included painting and soffit repair. Site work included additional parking, site improvements, and outdoor learning areas.  Scottsville Elementary's addition and improvements added approximately 17,500 square feet to the building and added improvements to the existing building and site. The additions included four additional classrooms, two smaller resource rooms, two offices, bathrooms, and a full-size gym. Improvements to the existing building included repurposing the current gym into instructional space, as well as other modernizations and renovations throughout the building to improve space for both staff and students.  Site improvements included outdoor learning areas and septic system enhancements. At the completion of the project, all trailers and modular classrooms will also be removed. The project adhered to LEED principles and practices. As we've seen with the examples at Woodbrook, Western Albemarle, Red Hill, and Scottsville, significant renovations have occurred concurrently with building expansions and additions.  However, this naturally leads to somewhat unequal school facilities, and we recommend that dedicated renovation funding is needed at all levels. The last time a significant renovation and modernization budget was approved was in fiscal year 18. Since 2017, the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee's highest priority recommendations have included school renovations at all levels.  In a community survey administered during the summer of 2021, respondents recommended that the following are important criteria to use in project prioritization. Upgrading athletic facilities and outdoor play spaces to foster good physical health, making sites accessible for local and community-based events, adding natural light in classrooms and making it easier to access outdoor spaces, renovating spaces to foster good mental health habits, well-being, and collaboration, and improving access for students with disabilities.  The requested renovation projects represent substantive investments in our school buildings, including the implementation of recommendations of the High School Master Plan Study. A phased multi-year approach will bring the school division's aging schools to modern standards to include improvements such as electrical infrastructure updates to accommodate technology, ensuring classrooms have natural light, improvements to adhere to the Americans with Disabilities Act, outdoor learning space updates, and reconfiguration of spaces to improve function and efficiency.",

    "text": " So I want to thank Patrick Huddleston, Lindsay Snoddy, and Sheila Hoopman for putting together that video. Again, I hope that provides a good visual for you and for our community around the impact that new and improved space has on the learning environment. I think sometimes visuals are stronger than our words.  So while we are proud of the work we have completed, there is a lot of work to still be done. And so the renovation portions of the projects would be in the capital budget, but tonight we would like to also discuss a furniture replacement program, which will be funded by the operating budget.  So this draft funding request includes the establishment of a furniture replacement program. This program provides for the replacement of classroom furniture, including tables, desks, storage, seating, and specialty items. The new furniture replaces aged and out-of-date pieces, and when combined with professional development, produces furniture that supports the classroom environment and functionality.  So here are just some highlights about the program, looking backward and then looking forward. So next slide, please. So previously, wide-scale furniture replacement efforts were funded by the Learning Space Modernization Capital Project. But as Ms. Kumazawa mentioned, the criteria for capital projects has recently changed, and so this work no longer meets the definition for capital funding, which is why it's now built into our operating request.  But similar to Mr. Foreman's comment around the technology replacement program, I think this is a positive. It gives us more control and advocacy for this work. Pre-pandemic, furniture was replaced division-wide in all kindergarten and first grade classrooms. This systematic grade level approach provides parity amongst our facilities. And it has also been an opportunity to provide division-wide professional development to support the work.  It's a plan do study act cycle so we involve teachers in the planning and the decision making as they choose from different packages. We install the furniture and then we gather their feedback through use of surveys and observation and we use that information to inform the next grade level.  Unfortunately, this work was stalled when the pandemic began and funding was not available. So we are excited to restart this work. And if the funding is afforded in this operational budget, we will replace all second grade classroom furniture for the 23-24 school year. And then each subsequent year, the next grade level will be replaced. We feel that furniture is a functional necessity, and this is a systematic approach to ensure we have a planned and fair replacement cycle amongst all schools.  Are there any questions about the furniture replacement program?",

Many went to the additional classrooms we added with the mobile units at the high schools and Henley, but others went into existing classrooms to promote social distancing. We intentionally selected a style of desk that supports the goals of all these modernization efforts. So they reconfigure into different groups. And so our plan is once we start bringing all the furniture back that's from storage, right,  and we will integrate those desks into some of these plans or upper grades. We have very intentionally purchased adjustable heights so they can be used in both elementary and secondary. It's because these classroom packages include desks, right, but they also include storage and seating, and so we feel like it would be all complementary of it.",

And the first piece will focus on differentiated staffing as requested by you to understand that a little bit better and the value it provides to our school division.  With, I wanted to bring back our strategic plan learning for all because with differentiated staffing, we can facilitate thriving students to ensure academic and social emotional development for our students while eliminating opportunity access and achievement gaps. It also supports respecting and championing the diversity of life experiences of our students. And then finally getting the right resources and staffing to our schools is key for the success of our teachers and students.  Here's an overview of our staffing standard of how we allocate classrooms, teachers, and differentiated staffing to our schools. So the base teacher allocation, which you'll see on the top right, is based on the staffing, the classroom staffing ratios that we discussed during work session one. So for an elementary school, for example, at the K-3 levels,  These are staffed at a ratio of 19.55 students, and grades four through five are staffed at 21.75 students. These are the proposed ratios for FY23. In addition to the classroom teacher staffing, the 22.1, for example, the school will, in addition, get differentiated teacher staffing. And that's based on the enrollment of the number of economically disadvantaged students projected at their school.",

    "text": "Good evening. I am proud to be the principal at Greer Elementary School. And our purpose at Greer, which is shared here on this screen, is to change lives in our community and to provide equity and to eliminate achievement gaps. And those are certainly bold goals.  And one of the many ways that we work towards achieving those is to use differentiated staffing. I'm grateful to have an opportunity tonight to speak with you, share some information about how we use differentiated staffing at Career. We educate around 500 students from preschool to fifth grade. Our students come from all over the world and they create a unique and diverse community for us. And one of the many ways that we support these students is through the hard work of our amazing staff, some of whom are provided for  for us by differentiated staffing formula. This coming school year, we will be using around eight and a half FTEs of differentiated staffing to support our students. So the staffing standards that Ms. Kumazawa was describing are based on enrollment numbers  And they don't account for specific school demographics and so some of careers demographics that may not be accounted for on enrollment projections and enrollment formulas. include our poverty level, as well as our students who are transient coming into our school after the school starts and leaving before the end of the year in the past for context.  outside of the pandemic or has typically had a poverty level of around 75% as a school. This is important, not only because there's also a causal relationship between poverty and student achievement, but also because our division, as Ms. Kamizawa just pointed out, uses poverty levels as the indicator and the way that they staff for differentiated staffing.  In addition, because we welcome students throughout the year, our population changing in that way means that we are regularly adding and sometimes withdrawing students throughout the year. And our differentiated staffing model allows us to prepare for that and to be proactive. Next slide, please. On this slide, you can see the projected breakdown.  of our classrooms from kindergarten to fifth grade for next year. At the elementary level, it's important to remember that students largely spend most of their day within their homeroom class or with that cohort of students. As principals, we generally develop  both the building logistics as well as the overall staffing plan based on the number of homeroom sections that we will have. Therefore, we start first by creating staffing plans by looking at the overall number of classroom sections or homeroom sections that we'll need at each grade with the goal of creating the smallest class sizes possible. As you can see on the far left section, we're scheduled to have roughly 450 students next year in kindergarten to fifth grade.  Through our regular staffing, we're provided roughly 22 classroom teachers. The numbers in sections and the class size averages are noted in the blue column. By using differentiated staffing for positions in this case, we're able to decrease the average class size by increasing the number of homeroom sections. And you can see that in the orange column on the right.  In general, principals develop staffing plans, and we meet with our central office staff for their consultation review and approval. This allows each principal to develop plans for the unique needs of that principal's school, and also provides a consistent process across the division about how we utilize our staffing allocations, including differentiated staffing. Next slide, please. This slide provides a general breakdown of how we're  planning to use the eight and a half FTE of differentiated staffing for next year. First, as noted on the previous slide, we reduced class sizes by adding in four additional classroom teachers.  Next, we used additional staffing to increase physical education, art and PE, and music for teachers. This staffing is necessary because as you add additional classroom sections, you need additional sections of art, PE and music. In addition,  We know that students will benefit from PE classes that are smaller, art classes that are smaller, music classes that are smaller. And finally, our students benefit from about 60 minutes of those activities each day. And we know that that impact is large because, as I said, the smaller class sizes.  We then added in a second full-time counselor. Our counselors support the social emotional SEL needs of all of our students, even outside of a pandemic. And they're critically important, not only to the well-being of our students, but also the entire school. The staffing standards career receives only one school counselor.  The addition of another school counselor through differentiated staffing and the SEL coach position allows us to have three highly trained adults who are able to provide both proactive and in the moment support to our students. We then use another staffing position to hire teaching assistants. We use our TAs in a variety of ways, sometimes to support in the homeroom, sometimes to provide academic support, and then also to help with our transient student population.  So, for example, we know in a given year career may enroll hundred new students since the beginning of the year. This year we've we've positioned some of our ta's to help us with new new students when they arrived during the year, so we knew. That we were going to be receiving students who are refugees from Afghanistan and we knew that they may be coming into grades.  in which we already had a little bit larger class sizes. And so we could put a teaching assistant in that class to allow either the homeroom teacher some time on the students' first day to interact with the student while the TA would cover some of the class. The TA could also help take the student on a tour of the building. The TA could be associated with the student during the day to help provide immediate support. There are many ways we could do that. And the differentiated staffing that we use with teaching assistants allow us that flexibility.  And finally, we also use one staffing position to provide math intervention for our students. As a reminder, as I'm sure you know, our students participate in Title I reading program, receive reading support that way, but we don't receive any math support. And so we use differentiated staffing to provide math support for our students.  I recognize as a principal that it's difficult to show quantitatively that this differentiated staffing model may work, but I am confident as a principal that it works for our students. I see it every day. I see it in the stronger relationships that our students and our teachers have because of the smaller class sizes. I see it in the increased opportunities for students to experience art, PE, and music in smaller classes. I see the increased collaboration and professionalism that exists in our school because of the strengthened PLC model.  I see it in ways that our two school counselors and our SEL coach meet with our students every day. I see it in the academic gains that our students are making, particularly as we're coming out of our annual mid-year review process and our ability to provide additional math support to students. And I see it in the significant decrease in discipline referrals over time for our students, which tells me that they're more engaged in class and learning.  As I shared at the beginning, I know that we have admittedly bold goals for our school to change lives and to be a place that eliminates gaps and provides equity. But I also know that the best way to do that is not by focusing on large numbers, but by focusing on individual students one day at a time. And I know that differentiated staffing allows me and other principals in the county  take that vision and to make it a reality at our school every day for every student. So I appreciate the opportunity to share on our behalf of what differentiated staffing looks like at a school and to share this case study and I welcome any questions you may have at this time.",

    "text": "Thank you, Steve. Thank you for the presentation, Steve. I really appreciate it. And thank you, Miss Lee.  What I think is that we can demonstrate using the staffing at the schools. We may not see from year to year perhaps great gains in achievement, whereas achievement is measured one time per year with one test, with an SOL test. However, all of our schools demonstrate growth for their students, particularly students that are  behind, even with the SOLs. Ever since Virginia introduced growth as a measure for SOL testing, many of our schools have maintained the very rigorous standards for accreditation by showing growth with their students. I know that when Dr. Saunders was principal at Baker Butler, the way he really began to develop  the success of the school was first through growth. And then that led to eventually the Blue Ribbon Award for the school around closing achievement gaps. Much of that accomplished with differentiated staffing at the school. I believe the same thing will happen at Greer. And I believe that as we focus more on growth, which is really a measure of a student moving from where they are at the beginning of the year to the middle of the year to the end of the year, that's where we're going to see the gains that we have.  Ultimately, a student coming into school who is behind, who's had interrupted education, or perhaps comes from another nation where they have not been to school at all, they have to make more rapid growth than a typical student. And so I think it's incumbent upon the division, as you said, to develop a way to see that growth and make it more transparent to our community.  I fully support what you said, what you suggested. The growth is there. Our students are more successful. They learn a great deal during the year. And we owe it to our teachers and our community to celebrate those successes. Right now, we are holding ourselves accountable to a static one-time-per-year measure. We really need to focus on growth.",

And also, in the past, while I don't disagree with using differentiated staffing, I think there needs to be more  guidance about what it's used for. The presentation that we just heard sounded like a great use, but if we have determined that it's beneficial to students in this position to have an extra counselor, then that should just be what the standard is. And I'll tell you the specific incident that comes to mind. I'm pretty sure I don't want to throw a school under a bus, but I went to a school that had differentiated staffing. They were using it for a music teacher or an art teacher, which is fine, but I didn't know. We give a lot of flexibility.  And I don't want to say that I don't like people having autonomy over their schools, but at some point, if the point of this staff or this money is to help with the achievement gap and with student performance, I don't know. I just would want, I'd want almost, I hesitate to say, but almost more uniformity. If not uniformity, then at least cause it like a direct correlation between whatever decision you're making and why you're doing it and how it ties in and that to be more apparent and obvious.  Because now I know a lot about what career is doing, but I don't necessarily know about all the other schools.",

Right after mid year review is where we begin to do the staffing process for the coming year schools are assigned staffing as well as differentiated staffing they develop.  staffing plan that's in alignment with their school improvement goals for the coming year. They come to the central office with that plan. They meet with a team, including members of our equity staff, our deputy superintendent for instruction, personnel staff, and finance staff.  to ensure that the staffing plan that they've developed will align with their school improvement goals to meet the growth goals as well as the achievement goals that they have for the school. It is a shame that after the, as we made our way through the 18-19 school year and really firmed up these procedures and became more consistent than ever, that we came into a pandemic. And many principals have,  really been struck by the fact that they were making great progress during the 18-19 school year and 19-20 school year. We could see the growth. And so we have really been thrown off by the past two years of the pandemic. I am looking for next year to be a year of great growth for our students as they return. And I hope the board understands that  We do not just sprinkle staffing around the school system, leave it up to the principals to do what they want with it, and then hope for the best of success. It is far more organized, it is far more resource-oriented, and it's targeted toward meeting students' needs. Thank you.",

    "text": " Thanks, Maya. Thank you all for giving me the opportunity to get to talk about our foreign language elementary school program. I do want to go ahead and just distinguish that we have two world language programs that exist at our elementary schools. We have a dual language immersion program that's at Mountain View and then we have our foreign language elementary school program.  that's expanding across our division. And that's what we're going to talk about. But I'm also happy to answer questions on our immersion program. And so our foreign language elementary school program is really just a chance for us to approach language learning with our youngest students and allow them to develop basic communicative skills in the target language while also just being exposed to and getting an enriching cultural experience at  that age. And so if you look at the chart here and also in your budget book on page G-19, you can see our current schools. We've included Broadus Wood because they started their research stage of implementation pre-pandemic, and then our foreign language elementary school programs, or FLES, were put on hold briefly, and so they'll be moving into implementation next year.  Crozet, Meriwether, Lewis, Mountain View, Murray, and Woodbrook are already in implementation, and you can see here which languages they use and which stage of implementation they are in. And then if you go ahead and go to the next slide.  So this is our plan for growth so that all of our elementary schools are able to implement FLES really starting by school year 2025-26 and fully grown out by 2027-2028.  The next four schools who are implementing will be going into their planning year next year, and their focus is on selecting which language they want to explore in consultation and collaboration with their entire school community, including the families, and in selecting the appropriate materials that they're going to use to best foster and encourage student learning.  And I know that this board likes to look at how we measure success of our FLES program. And so in general, our students to measure world language success, we use the STAMP test. And Mountain View, which is our longest running FLES program, has had students take that in the past. Unfortunately, for the past two years, we have not had widespread STAMP  implementation because the test must be taken in person. And so due to virtual learning, that was challenging, but we're excited to get our data back next year. However, our FLESS programs also focus specifically on interpersonal communication, and we leave interpretive and presentational communication into our middle school and high school. That's the same way in general we scaffold our world language. We focus on interpersonal first in level one,  and then built up to interpretive and presentational. And in FLETS, we also focus, really, when we think of world language learning standards, we look at ACTFL, the American Council on Teaching of Foreign Languages, and their five Cs. And so we focus also on the four Cs that don't relate to communication. And so we focus on also how we can integrate cultures, connections, comparisons, and communities.  And I am happy to answer any questions.",

So I'm here tonight to highlight how the SEL counselors help enhance the school counseling program through a combined focus on mental health and social emotional learning. Next slide please.  This graphic shows the overlap of some of our school-based mental health professionals. First, I'd like to talk about our school counselors. They are state-licensed school counselors who focus on three core domains, academics, career, and social-emotional learning. Then we have, due to the school board support, we have added our SEL counselors who come from a variety of backgrounds. So they have licensed professional school counselors, social workers, et cetera.  So these positions were implemented to be in conjunction with our school counselors to help each school support our students social emotional learning based on feedback from teachers, parents, community members, and administrators from the pandemic. So I hope this helps clarify the distinction between our SEL counselors and our school counselors.",

So you have academics, career, and social emotional. So school counselors are well equipped to handle students' social emotional needs in schools, but they also have other duties. So at the high schools, they also help with course registration. They talk students through career counseling also. So helping them process and work through all the different steps of  courses that they're going through with high school in collaboration with families. And so there's a lot of different responsibilities that school counselors oversee. And so the social emotional counselor is an extra support built in to help meet the needs of all the social emotional needs that we've seen built up over the last two years. So the social emotional counselor doesn't have that three domains, they really focus in on the one domain.  And so they are in conjunction support of the school counselors. And so it's a big teaming effort at all three levels. Does that make it a little bit more clear? Yep, thanks.",

What immediate action items do you have for staff? And also what is one takeaway for the request to the Board of Supervisors on March 14th? So what is one thing that you would like to stress in that presentation that would be presented by the chair and the vice chair?
