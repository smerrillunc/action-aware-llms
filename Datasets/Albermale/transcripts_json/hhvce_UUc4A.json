So the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members.  As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment, despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all the school board members for review. And as long as the school board continues to hold its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m.  Speakers will have three minutes to speak. They will be notified when they reach a two minute mark. I'll fold up a finger indicating you have one minute left. And then I will let you know when the three minutes are up. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial districts and speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governments or the operations of the school division.  Last, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. We have one speaker and that is Ray Ovalle. I don't know if I see him or her on here.",

I'm here tonight to request that you consider giving all the classified staff a 5% wage increase. As mentioned in the budget request, we did not get a raise last year. We're appreciative of the 2% increase that you're recommending. However, we needed to factor in cost of living increase and the importance of what we do for Albemarle County Schools. I'd like to highlight some of the classified staff who support education of children and worked in the buildings throughout the year.  I'm going to begin with building services, which is composed of HVAC, plumbing, electrical, carpentry, energy management, security, fire alarms, grounds, air quality, and custodians. We're typically the first department called for building needs. We're considered essential personnel who maintain the air quality for students, provide snow removal services, monitor alarm systems, and clean and sanitize buildings.  All these services allow students to be safe, healthy, and in school regularly, so learning can be maximized. Next, I'll address administrative assistants who are at a greater risk for various reasons. Each day, they ensure visitors follow the COVID-19 check-in so students can stay healthy and attend school. They monitor who enters the buildings and act as a first line of defense against an intruder.  They also make sure students leave with the appropriate person when early dismissal comes. They play an integral part in keeping our children safe. School nurses have been crucial this year. Their responsibilities have increased significantly. They check temperatures as students enter the building, oversee sanitation stations, and keep in close communication with various health officials. They've also been supporting vaccine clinics,  and they're required to have an LPN license as well as CPR certification. Food services and bus drivers have also worked collaboratively together getting meals to our families. We all know that safety and nutrition are basic needs that need to be met and enhance the wellbeing of our students. Food services personnel and bus drivers have made that possible. One minute left, thanks.  We can't forget the IT department who has been critical to the infrastructure of schools. They have provided a seamless connection for teachers to work with students virtually. They have a group of help desk personnel eager to solve computer issues. This has certainly been an unprecedented year where technology has been a crucial part of learning.  Teachers aides like food services personnel have been working since the beginning of COVID-19. Students are considered part of a vulnerable population, have received in-person instruction. Teachers aides have been here daily to support their education, regardless of the risk.  As stated previously, we recommend a 2% increase is nice and may help with the retention of staff currently. However, an equal raise of 5% would not only help with the cost of living increase, but more importantly, help with moral pride and unity of all classified staff.",

This is the third of a series of three work sessions focused on special topics in our funding request. We're happy to continue receiving written questions after tonight and throughout the continuing budget process in April and May.  Our agenda for this evening is as follows. Mr. Kevin Kirst will present the student safety coaches proposal, followed by Dr. Bernard Hairston's presentation on the equity expansion. You'll see in both of their presentations an adherence to a logic model that we've established in order to ensure timely implementation of the proposals, monitor our activities, and provide a means to ensure, to measure results and impacts of these new programs.  These metrics aren't set in stone, but rather serve as guidelines for moving the proposals forward. As you'll see, the metrics are continually being refined in the same way that our proposals are continuously being improved. After the proposal presentations, I'll review some of our one-time expenditures for fiscal year 22. And then finally, I will provide a summary of our revisions since the draft funding request was presented, including an adjustment to the KTEC transfer.  And with that, I will turn things over to Mr. Kirst.",

    "text": "Good evening. I am Kevin Kirst, your Executive Director of Special Education and Student Services. The first thing I want to point out is a discrepancy in the title for you. Because what you may have expected to see was school safety specialist.  And really, it was admittedly an 11th hour change. But with all the work that we've been doing on this proposal, I think you'll find the division's decision to change the title to Student Safety Coach  really reflects the direction of this proposal much more, I think, accurately than the previous title. So if you bear with me and allow me to share some of the goals and other information, I think you'll bear my point out. So the goals of the student safety coach proposal is to improve school climate and reform school discipline.  while continuing to build upon and improve our safe and secure educational environments across the division. We're going to do this through a really concentrated focus on mental health, de-escalation, and restorative justice through this proposal, while maintaining the safety and security of students, school staff, and our property.  This proposal, I think, fits quite well with the objectives of our strategic plan and helps advance that plan by addressing the objectives of engaging every student, improving opportunity and achievement, and optimizing our resources. The strategic priority of these eight full-time equivalent positions as part of this proposal  directly addresses the identification and removal of practices that perpetuate the achievement gap. I'd like to review the essential responsibilities of the student safety coaches. And the first is paramount. It is there and the biggest because I do believe it feeds into all the others. So I just wanna take a few extra seconds on that. And that is the student safety coaches  are going to provide a safe and secure environment for students, staff, and guests through the building of relationships with the stakeholders that they serve. They're going to establish themselves as part of our school culture by being an active and front-facing change agent through caring and problem-solving with the staff and the kids that they serve.  They will be active in ensuring that the perspective of mental health equity and restorative justice is infused into their interactions with those around them.  Additional responsibilities, again, that will just be infused in all of the other areas, will include them serving on intervention teams. Two of note are school-based intervention teams and threat assessment teams, but there are others. They will support our school division efforts, not just in a prevention capacity, but also when it does occur with regard to school truancy.  They'll conduct, assist administration in conducting investigations, but we did want to point out specifically, they will assist the division as well in implementing Title IX investigations, which really does look at sexual and gender discrimination and harassment. The fifth responsibility will be facilitating inspections of our campus to ensure compliance with safety and security codes.  participating in monthly school safety meetings and assisting staff, police and emergency personnel, not just in handling crisis situations, but in planning for them, right? So doing that prevention work as well. Our next slide, I'm going to review  the inputs that specifically we are looking to address before our next school year. Before next school year begins, our goal is to finalize a job description, publish an organizational chart that clearly delineates how the student safety coaches fit within our system, determine physical placement, a plan,  for the allocation of the staffing and resources across the division. Publish an operational handbook, not just for the student safety coaches, but for administration and our community, so that it's very transparent as to exactly what the role of our student safety coaches in our buildings is about. All the positions would be screened for, interviewed, and candidates hired.  before the beginning of the school year, and to note that required professional development that we're going to make required by Albemarle County Public Schools would be completed before the first day of school. Those are the inputs we want to highlight. On the activity side of things,  And really to drill down a little bit more on the preparation of the individuals that would become student safety coaches would be certification by the Department of Criminal Justice Services as school security officers really to enhance that perspective on the security side of security and safety. They would also be required to complete  a number of topics in training here in Amara County Public Schools, which includes, but is not limited to, trauma-informed and culturally responsive student interactions, mental health first aid, in addition to basic traditional first aid, and then training in school safety measures, crisis intervention, and de-escalation techniques and skills.  We also are going to support training in conducting Title IX investigations and for the individuals that are student safety coaches for them to be active participants in our threat assessment process. Our outputs.  What we expect to happen is 100% of our state and locally required school safety and security reviews, audits, and inspections will not only be done on time, but will be done successfully through their support. That the student safety coaches will participate in monthly safety meetings with each administrative team at the schools.  They would continue their professional learning on an ongoing basis by participating and working collaboratively with the coordinator of mental health and wellness. And then they will also be participating at a larger level in the division with our school safety liaisons at each of the schools. And I do want to highlight that this, we would be,  expecting community participation as well by the Albemarle County Police Department in the focus of planning for, executing, and receiving feedback on our drills and procedures to ensure that security and safety of our staff and students.  On the outcome side of things, we're looking to develop a specific internal survey of our school administrators, faculty, and students specifically about this proposal to get their perceptions of safety and security on our campuses. We would then also assess the accomplishment of tasks that were delineated by the director of student services and the principals.  And then lastly, our SMART goals will be determined by the success of a three-year trend on data on school climate by both staff and students, particularly looking at their feelings of safety and security while at school. In summary, this proposal is looking at eight full-time equivalent positions  of these student safety coaches with operational budget, as you can see, of $15,000, a total budget of a little over $550,000 that would include new funding required to make this work of over $286,000. If there are, I would be more than happy to entertain any questions, comments, or concerns.  I had a question, who are the school safety liaisons? Yes. Each school building, we ask the principal to designate who they would like to be the point of contact for school safety. I will say that the majority are either the principals themselves or a designated assistant principal.",

But that's the idea. They'd be anchored to a secondary school, right, with eight or three middles, five middles, three high schools. And then from there, sort of taken geographically, the elementary, including the charter schools, right, under their wing for full coverage.

So in the past for other coverages, we have looked at geographical locations like with Burleigh, for example, right across the street. So that might be one of the things that are put on the table of how could we pull in the support of the charter school, the charter campus.  Again, not having the specifics just yet, I could see that being very reasonable to consider.",

    "text": "Second,  to provide oversight and implementation of the anti-racism policy and other equity regulations involving ongoing reviews and updates. This requires curriculum development and training from an equity and an anti-racism lens. Third,  We are very happy to announce that all contracts of new hires effective 2021 will require culturally responsive teaching training, and they must meet the micro-credential or certification requirements within three years to maintain continuous contract status. This will certainly have an impact on the culture of Albemarle County Public Schools. And fourth,  The inclusion of an equity and anti-racism framework will help address a systemic transformation of racial and equity achievement disparities. This will allow for a concentrated focus on identifying as well changing division philosophies, division policies, programs, and practices recognized as barriers.  Next slide. We believe this equity proposal as a part of requesting the three FTEs to expand the equity specialist team from three to six staff members  will address four of the five division objectives and the three strategic priorities while advancing the division's strategic plan. We believe this request is specific to training all staff to engage every student by placing value on their social and cultural experiences as relevant to how and what they teach.  This approach centers on strengthening the student, the family, and community partnerships.  We believe the results produce a best practice to identify and develop students' interests in understanding the value of teaching to the whole child. We also believe this will naturally reduce opportunity and achievement gaps, which will optimize resources while maximizing the tier one teaching and learning process. You might call that avoiding an achievement gap.  Next slide, please. Now, this slide will help us understand the focus, our focus over the past 12 years. I will speak to these reference points from the bottom left of the slide to the top when you see the anti-racism orientation. In 1999,  Albemarle County Public Schools was one of the first school divisions in the state to staff a diversity coordinator and allotted stipends to diversity resource teachers in each school to lead courageous conversations about equity and inclusion. In 2008, a resource utilization study recommended a downsizing of central office staff positions. The, unfortunately,  the diversity, or fortunately, the diversity coordinator position was eliminated. Rather than discontinuing this critical work, the focus shifted from courageous conversations, and that's the fortunate part, to culturally responsive teaching to address one of the three goals of eliminating achievement gaps. Now, from a historical perspective,  the culturally responsive teaching model evolved from the research of Geneva Gay's book, Culturally Responsive Teaching, Theory, Research, and Practice, Bonnie Davis's work of How to Teach Students Who Don't Look Like You, and the research of Zoretta Hammond, Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain. Now, in 2009, the work was field tested  with MQ, which stands for Math Men Mission. And this program was offered through a summer academy, a community partnership initiative with the 100 Black men of Central Virginia to prepare African American male middle school students to enroll and complete Algebra I by grade eight. There were only two  African American males enrolled in the seventh grade and eighth grade algebra classes offered in the five middle schools in that year. MQ teachers were hired and retrained to teach to and through the culture of the students enrolled. Parents participation was a required partnership.  Learning occurred naturally through a culturally relevant and collectivist approach centered on the student, not on the teacher.  High expectations were modeled by framing the student as scholars of brilliance and taught at Bloom's Taxonomy's highest levels. Subsequently, the National School Boards Association recognized Albemarle County Public Schools in 2011 and 2013 with the Magna Award for Innovative Best Practices for Closing Achievement Gaps. In 2015,  The culturally responsive teaching model introduced an assessment tool to validate the relationship of CRT curriculum design, professional development training, and personalized follow-up coaching. This assessment involves  the submission of a maximum of a 10-page portfolio that documents the evidence of teacher and student growth over the course of a school year. Each candidate presents their evidence to a team, generally four or five staff members, who are assessors to validate the impact on student achievement.  This process requires intensive staff time personalized to each candidate simply because every student is different. Now, between 2015 and 2018, the organizational structure expanded to include an equity leadership team, school-based equity teams in each school,  and you, the school board, approved two equity specialist positions and the CRT micro-credential was introduced. Between 2016 and 2018, about 500 staff were trained in the three culturally responsive teaching modules, of which 17 educators received certification and 13 completed the micro-credential.  Now, in 2019, you approved staffing for a third equity specialist honoring our growth. At the same time,  The anti-racism policy was adopted and the anti-racism steering committee was created to implement the 22 regulations of the policy. That same year, the equity team facilitated multiple community conversations as directed by you, the school board. This work has expanded this year to rolling out an unprecedented challenge of deinstitutionalized racism.  All staff are engaged in the courageous conversation about race book study and the orientation training on the anti-racism policy. This slide truly represents a progressive school division, and I thank you as visionary leaders. Next slide, please.  Now, this graph represents a snapshot of services offered since 2015-16 school year and projections through 2024 to understand the increasing demand for services. The light blue dotted line illustrates the professional development training growth  from 2015 to 2024. For example, in 2016, there were 12 educators to receive the required training on the three characteristics or the modulus of culturally responsive teaching. Now, this peaked to about 170 in 2019 and will exceed a modest projection of 300  by 2023. Now, the orange line tracks the number of educators who completed the CRT micro-credential since its introduction in 2017. We are projecting growth from the original 13 in 2017 to close to 288 candidates by 2023.  The purple line tracks the number of educators who completed the CRT certification since its introduction in 2015-2016. For example, there were 12 educators to experience the modular training throughout the year. Four of the 12 completed the process and received the certification.  Now we are projecting growth from the original four in 2015 to close to 160 candidates, 61 candidates by 2023. Keep in mind, the equity team must be prepared to coach and assess about 449 candidates engaged in the micro-credential and certification by 2023.  Now we want you to focus your attention on the far right-hand side of the slide. These items represent three of the many impactful unplanned, unplanned spinoff initiatives that occur because of things such as a new policy or policy revision or directives from the school board or our superintendent or a strategic plan initiative.  These initiatives, these new initiatives, always require planning, follow up action steps, and accountability oversight to receive those long term outcomes. So in August, for example, as per a directive,  I think from the school board. The equity team led 1,249 staff members through multiple community conversations to assist with understanding the division's goal around equity, access,  and the equity mission statement. Staff were introduced to achievement gap data and a historical perspective of race relations in Albemarle County Public Schools. The comments received were overwhelmingly positive. In the 2020-21 school year, 1,366 staff members  have participated in one or more courageous conversations about book study discussions. Equity specialists have planned and facilitated monthly leadership team meetings, school-based faculty meetings have occurred, and monthly theater pattern courageous conversation forums have also occurred.  And also to date, 837 staff members this year have completed the anti-racism orientation training and completed the verification form. Here's a good example of the work that's taking place and how impressed we are with how staff members have embraced this work. Last Friday, from 7 a.m.  to 8.30 a.m., Mr. Jim Foley, the Director of Transportation, and his leadership team facilitated a virtual training session for 188 participants. Mr. Foley's team worked with the equity team over several months to prepare, and they are now working on smaller group follow-up training sessions. Next slide, please.  Now, here are examples of inputs and activities that will require immediate attention. By June 2021, the following deliverables will be completed for establishing the planning foundation. We will formulate an operational plan to address the expansion  of staff responsibilities with a focus on building a team of culturally and racially equity leaders. We will review the current equity specialist job description, advertise the position, if approved, interview and hire as soon as possible, and begin training the newly hired equity specialist. Also,  By August 2021, the following deliverables will be completed to demonstrate the proposal in progress.  We will examine the current state utilization of resources targeted to daily operational demands. This process actually began in November 2020 by considering requests for services and the resources we manage well. One thing we determined is that our biggest resource is our social capital or the staff members in the school division who support this work because they believe in the work.  We will collaborate with the Human Resources Department to establish structures that require all new hires to receive professional development training and a micro-credential or certification within three years. We will also coordinate with the committee tasked to review the teacher and administrative performance appraisal plans to ensure culturally responsive teaching practices are embedded.  Next slide please. Let's look at the outputs and the outcomes. And the following short-term goals will demonstrate successful implementation of the proposal. Participation in micro-credentialing and certification will increase by 70% in 2021-22.  Successful participants will be recognized and celebrated at the annual diversity conference and receive stipends of $500 for the micro credential and $1,000 for the certification. Principals will establish equity dashboards specific to their school data to be aligned with their school improvement plans and performance goals.  Principals will have acquired skills for goal-setting strategies and tracking achievement data based on gradual increases of staff completing the culturally responsive teaching requirements. Now, I encourage each of you to click on this link to review the number of educators who have completed the micro-credential or certification criteria by schools.  And as you look at this spreadsheet, this reporting of data, you'll notice that only 8.7% of our teachers have completed the process.  And so this is a good indicator that we're not going to see significant changes in individual schools or the school division until we reach that, let's say, approximately 40% threshold or higher with people being certified or receiving a certification. So if you look at that tracking, you'll see school by school, and you see that we have a lot of work to do, but it is doable.  Now, if we look at the outcomes, by the end of 21-22 school year, structures will be in place to institutionalize culturally responsive teaching as an expectation for all staff to participate. That means all new teachers as well experienced teachers.  By the end of 2023-2024 academic school year, schools will begin to see a gradual impact on student achievement growth data. At least 35% of the staff in the school division should have completed a validation or to be validated by either a microcredential or certification by that timeframe.  Next slide, please. In summary, the three equity specialists are currently involved in policy reviews, program evaluation oversight, equity audits, talent development, demographic surveys, community outreach initiatives, grading practices, LGBT policy development, portrait of a learner,  Design Team, COVID Recovery Steering Committee, the Human Resources Departmental Assessment Team, the Equity Advisory Committee, the Anti-Racism Steering Committee, school-based equity teams, liaisons to departmental departments, and each serves as liaisons to eight or more schools. Currently,  They're offering 7.30 a.m., 4.45, and 6 p.m. training sessions and offering personalized coaching to the 141 staff members who are exploring the certification or micro-credential assessment this year. So I thank you for considering this request for these three new positions. And as you can see, we are requesting 353,000  $675. I'm here to welcome any comments and or questions.",

And I want to say that one of the things Dr. Harrison and I talked about, there's a pivotal thing that takes place every year with the schools in the fall. When they first come back, they do something called the State of the School Address to the community. And our goal is to have their school dashboards ready for that public presentation.  Not only is it a static, I guess, figure or table that would reside publicly from their school webpage, but also they would have that opportunity to share it with their community and, you know, explain what the plans are to keep improving that data. Thank you.",

Yeah, and so the light dotted blue, you may have answered this, but I just wanted to confirm that that got up into the 400 plus range by 2024. And so let's just round it to 500 because I'm not sure how much further it was over the 400. Is that the cumulative number of people who would have  participated in CRT or is that line made up of the cumulative numbers going up for each year so that you're anticipating in some later years, 200 participating? Let's see.  I think you may have said that you were expecting to be at 400 and some odd teachers who would have participated. But I just wanted to confirm that.

So, for example, we are looking at training whole schools, starting with our small schools. And so let's say, for example, you have a school with 13 teachers.  we can coordinate with the principal and run all of those teachers through a year-long training. And that's what we're going to start seeing when we get high percentages of teachers in a school certified, that's when we're going to see the impact on student achievement. A student will go to a teacher in the first grade who's been culturally responsive, trained, second grade, third grade, and we're going to get the impact. So we're considering a  focusing training on those small schools or and or focusing training on those schools where administrators have gone through the process and they understand and embrace the work and we get the results from those schools everybody else is going to be lining up like they're trying to get a covid shot last question thank you very much for that that's a great explanation is um for your equity specialists the three uh",

    "text": "Next, I'll just spend a few minutes reviewing our proposed one-time expenditures plan for FY22. You may remember this slide from previous presentations about our revenues.  And I want to focus your attention to our FY21, our current year state revenues. At this time last year, you approved a state revenue projection of $57.8 million. But by the time we adopted our budget a few months later, that projection dropped to $52.8 million in response to the economic uncertainty we were experiencing at that time. That was the amount we adopted. At the same time, we reduced our expenditures to match this potential revenue loss.  Now we know that we'll be receiving a full $57.9 million from the state in the current year. It's approximately level to what we were originally anticipating. The expenditure savings that we're realizing in the current year will add to our fund balance. A different way to look at this is the table shown here. We're projecting a $5.1 million in state revenues higher than what we adopted and planned for.  This will fall to our fund balance, and we propose using $4.1 million of our fund balance during fiscal year 22. Here's a list of our proposed one-time expenditures. They're listed here with their budget amounts, as well as the page numbers in the funding request document for your reference. In addition, you can see how many of these align with our strategic plan objectives.  This evening, I'll provide a quick overview of the top three as they represent programmatic shifts in the next year. This is a program that was proposed last year to provide a $1,000 one-time incentive for first-year new hire teachers. The local hiring process has become extremely competitive and research indicates the need for offering  additional financial assistance and incentives to support teachers to transition them into their new careers. This also supports our initiative to increase the number of minority teachers across the division. So we'd like to propose this program again as a pilot in fiscal year 22. Some of the one-time funding will be used for capital expenditures since those are one-time in nature.  The lease of a mobile unit at Albemarle High School is expiring and we have the option for purchasing the unit rather than continuing with the annual lease payments. And third, we're dedicating a majority of the one-time funds to learning recovery. As a reminder, this piece will supplement the Federal CARES Act funding that we're also projected on receiving.  In total, we've earmarked over $8 million in funding dedicated to learning recovery. We also wanted to note that we plan on funding an expanded after-school program with these funds. So next, I will provide you with a quick review of where we are with regards to the original draft funding requests.  I have one more revision to share with you this evening, and it's related to the KTEC transfer. And Ms. Stephanie Carter is here if there are any questions. We're projecting an increase in the transfer that we made to KTEC in FY22. There are three primary factors involved with this. One is salary increases for staff to match our division's salary increase proposal. The addition of one FTE math instructor  And then finally, an increased proportion of ACPS student enrollment to overall enrollment at KTEC. So this has been added to the list of expenditure revisions from the FY22 draft funding request. The ones at the top were discussed last week at work session number two. We have added the additional costs for the transfer to KTEC. We're also proposing  to maintain a reserve for the remaining expenditures as we gain more information about our state revenues and that's incoming over the next several weeks. As they have proposed a different pay strategy, we want to reserve funds to make sure that we are funding our SOQ funded positions with salary increases that will allow us to pull down the full state funding. And you may also remember there remains a significant portion of operational restoration  that we did not fund. We'll be discussing this in the coming months aligned with the timing of when we receive more information about any additional state revenues. With that, I will stop for questions or comments.",

    "text": "Chairman Page, I do have another motion if you entertain it. It also is  got my attention in this budget season, but it is not critical for this budget season. It would be something to be done prior to the next budget season. And I'll just read what I have so I don't get screwed up. As you know, Albemarle County Public Schools provides additional funding based on  to individual schools based on the percentage of low income students enrolled. That is those students who are eligible for free and reduced cost school lunches. This differentiated funding model was introduced about, I know three superintendents ago, but about 20 years ago.  And I'm not sure it's ever been evaluated as a program. The overarching mission, I think, is to address the achievement gap. But any of us that have looked at the past decade of achievement gaps have seen that we still are not where we need to be. So I would like  I mean, because it's also it's focused only on income and not on the percentage of black and brown students, a number of English language learners and other demographic variables. And given the sizable investment that we make for differentiated funding. It's a huge investment. I would  I'd like to make a motion that we look at this, do a program evaluation of our differentiated funding model. Given our high priority is to reduce the achievement gap of race and income and other demographic groups, is this the best model that we can develop? Is it the best tool to address those achievement gaps? What is the rate of return on our investment?  And if some differentiated funding is warranted, and we do have great variability across our schools.  is the income-only model the most robust metric to use? So I would move that the division conduct a program evaluation of our differentiated funding model, including examining other ways the funds might be used, and as needed, engage external resources such as EAP to identify the best practices to address our persistent achievement gap.",

All right well before Dr. Haas comes forth I do have one. As you will recall we have had probably for the last  three or four weeks, each week a board meeting. And so I would like us to consider canceling the work session for March 25th. We have a closed meeting that's scheduled for the 25th. So we would still have that closed session. But I would like for the board to accept canceling the March 25th work session. Second.  That wasn't a motion, I can't make a motion, so we need a motion. I move that we cancel the March 25th work session. Is there a second? Second. Okay, moved by Mr. Alcaro. Well, any discussion on that motion?

    "text": "And this will really allow our staff, the central office staff. One of the things I'm  requiring all of our staff to do over the next couple of weeks is to be out in the schools more so than ever and be visible and supportive of staff as the schools are really working hard to make changes and get ready for the increased student and staff coming in. So that will be really, really helpful. Plus, just realizing that we do have the Board of Supervisors  presentation coming up that will help us to really facilitate your presentation along with Ms. Colson. So I really appreciate you all looking at that and the central staff can really use our energy to be supportive of the school. So thank you very much to the whole board. The other thing I had was kind of something that  really made my eyes pop. You know, annually we participate in the Golden Apple Awards for Teachers, which is a program that's sponsored by Better Living to recognize excellence in teaching in all of the schools in the Charlottesville-Albemarle area, that's public and private. And in the past, last year for example,  We, as a total for the whole school system over the whole process, we had 100 nominations for our teachers in our schools. And as of the fourth day, now that was over a seven week period. As of the fourth day, right now we've had over 1,000 nominations.  The process has changed so that the Nunley's and Better Living, they are doing it through Facebook, which allows obviously for greater participation also much more equity of participation by our students and families and community members to recognize teachers.  This election committee now is going to have a whole lot more work to do for the Golden Apples. But I really think this is a testament to the value that our community places on our teachers and how special they are to supporting our community. So I just wanted to announce that. I think that was just an amazing, amazing story. And I'm sure it'll be a headline for some time to come. So thank you very much.",
