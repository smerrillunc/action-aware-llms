I'm delighted to introduce tonight's spotlight on education because I'm the daughter of a public school science teacher who reached out to broaden his experiences in science  and creatively engaged students. So spotlighting one of Albemarle County's own is a real treat. In 1994, the US Congress signed into law the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowship Act, which provided a unique opportunity for highly accomplished K-12 teachers  to serve in a national setting, one of which is a Smithsonian Institute. Teachers are given access to and will leave with a national network of leaders and programs to consult. Not only will this invigorate their professional development around STEM, but it will enhance their contributions to their school division when they return home. Yes.  This highly prestigious national competition reached into Albemarle County this year for its newest recruit. She's Kate Cogey, who teaches science at our Charter Middle School. Kate will be working with the Smithsonian's famed Air and Space Museum, one of the most iconic, engaging, and heavily visited museums in our nation's capital. The timing is ideal for Kate,  in addition to not having COVID to deal with, the museum is in the process of reimagining all 23 of its galleries and presentation spaces to, as the museum says, to inspire a new generation of pioneers and explorers. The work, Kate says, will fit perfectly into her next year's lessons in physics. It's a dream come true for a teacher who is passionate about break the mold learning.  As exciting as the Einstein Fellowship is, it is not the first national selection process that tapped Kate's talents. A few years ago, she joined a cohort of influencers, which included a best-selling author, a movie star, I want to know who, an astronaut, and leading business executives and scientists in the NASA outreach program.  As the only educator chosen, Kate visited Vanderbilt Air Force Base for the launch of an environmental satellite. She participated in briefings on the mission, pre-launch activities, news conferences, and was a VIP for the satellite launch itself.  To capture her experiences for her students, Kate set up a YouTube channel. She returned to ACPS with an impressive lesson plan that ignited her students' interest to build their own launch pad and rockets. She also strengthened their engagement to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where her students met, talked with, and learned about space flight from the laboratory's principal scientists.  as Kate prepares to begin her Einstein fellowship. She's with us this evening to share her plans for what her goals will be and how the opening of these new frontiers of learning have and will continue to impact Kate and her students. So Kate, welcome tonight. And if you'd like to say a few words, I'm sure after that, all of my colleagues will have questions for you. But you have the floor.",

It has been just a dream come true to work with community lab school these past three years. It has been such an engaging and inspiring environment. And I am so excited to share  everything with the Smithsonian and bring back everything I learned in this next year to Agremont County. So thank you for everything, for creating this program for us. These past few years have been awesome. I'll be working, as you said, with the Air and Space Museum for the next year, working specifically on their Teacher Innovator Institute and  What that program is, is it brings each year 30 STEM educators from across the country for free to the Air and Space Museum. They get to stay there for two weeks and work with each other and build these amazing projects that they get to take back home to their schools. And I would love to have a cohort of Admiral County educators out there too. It's an incredible program.  I also would love to build projects with Averill County students, certainly with our school, but any school within the division. There are so many great resources there and I'm still learning quite a bit about them. This fellowship is quite, I'm learning something new every day, but yeah, thank you so much for this opportunity and for, yeah, for inviting me here today. And I'm happy to answer any questions or,  Anything.",

And so we'd love to share that. As well, Ed, there's a cohort of, so we're 18 fellows within the fellowship program.

Um, it's a really awesome program. Um, and so after the launch, well, prior to the launch, I reached out to the principal scientist, Thorsten Markus, who, uh, helped build that whole pro or put that whole project together. And, um,  So we reached out and we actually brought all of the students to meet all of the scientists and engineers on that mission. We got to check out the clean rooms where they put together parts of the satellite. We also got to connect with folks from the GLOBE program, which is NASA's educational outreach program specifically for citizen scientists.  And we learned about ways in which students in our school and students in other schools can actually track. We can actually like measure from the ground, the height of certain things, and it can compare to the ICESat-2 satellite to see if those measurements are accurate. So we did a lot of work along the lines of citizen science and how kids can participate in that too.",

I'm actually going to be kind of taking on a volunteer role with the Smithsonian and I'm taking part in this year's Teacher Innovator Institute.

The Office of Community Engagement will host the division's sixth annual equity conference on Friday, June 17th from 8.30 a.m. through 12.30 p.m. The conference theme is Purpose, Passion, and Progress. Keep rising to the top.  The purpose is to celebrate the continuation of a transformative journey of 69 educators who met the criteria for credentialing in culturally responsive teaching by earning a micro-credential or certification.  The conference is about acknowledging passion by showcasing the unwavering commitment to Albemarle County Public Schools evidence-based culturally responsive teaching homegrown best practice model for addressing achievement gaps. The P of practice is about highlighting the impact culturally responsive teaching is having on teacher and student learning.  The featured educators will share how they have begun to shift their teaching practice to teaching to and through their students' strengths from a cultural lens. These 69 educators are examples of our desire as a school division to keep rising to the top.  This featured group of educators represent our largest to date. We have grown from a cohort of four candidates in 2016, to 36 in 2018, to a total of 139 in 2020, and to a total of 2008 educators completing the culturally responsive teaching process over our six year history.  I believe you have received a link to register for this conference. We currently have over 220 participants registered, and we hope that you will be able to join us. Thank you for allowing me to make this announcement.",

    "text": " I'm going to start by reading the public comment guidelines. The school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic.  the school board is still committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments can be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the meeting and will be given to all the school board members for review. And second, so long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting.  We have a lot of speakers tonight I think last time I checked it was 41 and for that reason each speakers time instead of the regular three minutes, it will be two minutes and you should have all received that notification via email.  Before electronic public comment commences, a few things I think we should go over based on last time when we had a lot of things. One, I'm gonna just try to do an on-deck thing. So I'll say the speaker and I'll tell the next speaker to kind of get lined up that they're gonna be next. Two, please make sure you're muted until it is your time to speak. And then three, and this is a really big one, please follow the Zoom meeting to determine when you need to speak. Don't look at the live stream because there is a delay and it can create confusion.  So I think there's someone that already, yep, great. So speakers during the meeting should state their name and address, our magisterial district, our school that they attend. Further speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. And my last bit is although the school board will not respond directly to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. So with that,  Oh, and one last little piece of advice. We don't have a timer. I time things on my phone. It's a little hard for you to see when there's one minute left. I really strongly encourage you to time yourself so you have a kind of an understanding of when your time is coming up. So the first speaker is going to be Fontina Bumms, followed by Nikki Athe. So Fontina, I'm not sure if you're on.",

I also feel that it is critically important that the school fosters a respectful, inclusive learning environment. Hopefully, these are common goals amongst everyone in this meeting, and as such, I would encourage parents to, one, examine the Courageous Conversations curriculum and slides, and two, to read Gerald Singleton's book, Courageous Conversations About Race.  that is the basis for this curriculum. After reviewing the resources, I have found that they are directly opposed to creating an environment where every child is respected. Instead of teaching our kids to judge people based on their actions and character, this curriculum strips them of their individual identity and lumps them into categories based on the color of their skin, gender, sexual orientation, et cetera. As an example, the eighth grade curriculum slide specifically states that it is wrong to say things like,  We all belong to the human race, and there are two sides to every story. This curriculum actually says that these logical and uniting statements are racist and building blocks towards genocide. As a society, we have to work to achieve unity and mutual respect. A curriculum that divides children into groups and places primary importance on attributes that they cannot control will not achieve this goal. Thank you so much for your attention.",

    "text": "Good evening. I'm Nikki Athey from Samuel Miller. I will submit a letter detailing why I oppose the foundation principles behind the anti-racist policy, the overhaul of the strategic plan, the continuation of the Courageous Conversations program,  the ill-conceived use of funds supplied to equity trainers and outside policymakers, and my strong objections to the changes to the sex offender notification policy. I will also detail concerns about the subjective standards for introducing and reviewing new curriculum, the equity review cycle for updates to policy, and evaluation criteria of success in the new paradigm set forth by the draft strategic plan. I ask tonight  for board members to commit to listening, hearing, and responding in earnest to the concerns of the community. Some of the feedback that concerned parents are receiving from the school board or ACPS staff has ranged from disinterested to patronizing to flatly arrogant.  What is being presented to you is genuine concern, well thought through and well researched positions and hopefulness for achieving a solution agreeable to all, and all with the best interest of children at heart. What citizens who disagree with ACPS positions and its agenda have received in response is mockery closed doors and desires to strip them of the ability to choose what is best for their children.  Citizens have entrusted this board with a grave responsibility to provide a foundational education for Albemarle children commensurate with the $193 million budget. This trust has been either misdirected at best or abused at worst. ACPS is not a place for activism or social experimentation.  It is a place for sober deliberation of how to deliver the very best we have to offer children. And it is a place to set an example of how to balance priorities and work together when we have wildly different opinions without encouraging and stoking us versus them mentalities. I ask you to respectfully consider the recommendations of those who are seeing the fruits of these policies for the first time. Thank you.",

I attended a Catholic school with nuns as teachers. But despite that, when I was young, much younger than middle school, I heard some ignorant things, some racist things, hurtful things.  and repeated some of them, not really understanding the deeper meaning. And at that point, I don't really remember anyone saying, whoa, hold on. So I'm happy to have my kids get an open, honest, educational forum to learn about these issues and help my kids understand and know better. I know there are people who don't support this program, but please remember the 700 people who signed a letter supporting Courageous Conversations. Don't give up.  We're all with you. Thank you.",

First of all, I want to speak in support of the Henley Middle School student journalists who have been quoted in national conservative publications recently. I congratulate these students for their fine writing on the 1619 Project and LGBTQ identity. And I thank their teacher who has led outstanding real-world lessons on both facts and free speech. Along with over 700 other people, I urge the school board  to continue to support the approved ACPS anti-racism policy with professional development and instructional materials. I am so personally grateful to the Henley diversity resource teachers for creating lessons that are so age appropriate and engaging, and also to their classroom teachers who are leading the courageous conversation lessons so thoughtfully.  These lessons have sparked great conversation in my home. My sixth grader, mama, I have a bias towards cheeseburgers. And my eighth grader is so ready for the uncomfortable questions about skin color and economic and social disparities that he sees around him in the world. I'm also glad that teachers are affirming and fully including the transgender and gender expansive students who are at peddling.  that's in ACPS policy and state law. Plus it's consistent with my family values and my church values. I especially want to thank Dr. Costa for her bold leadership. All of the Henley educators are helping us raise a generation of humans who will try to make the U.S. and especially our local community more just and equitable. Thank you.",

    "text": " Hi, everyone. My name is Madeline Benedict. I'm an eighth grader at Headland Middle School, and I live in the Samuel Miller District. I'm going to be talking about the anti-racism policy and courageous conversations and why I support them. As a young white girl going to an almost all-white school, I've seen subtle and blatant racist views displayed by my fellow classmates on multiple occasions. And I'm not proud of it, but in most of those situations, I didn't say anything because I didn't know what to do because I wasn't educated on the topics of racism and anti-racism. There are two specific lessons I want to touch on when it comes to courageous conversations.  One was a video we watched about police brutality for people of color, and one talked about white privilege. The video showed issues that are very serious in our community and are the kinds of productive conversations and topics that we really need to delve into. People with white privilege, myself included, should be held to the standard of acknowledging white privilege, racism, and trying to dismantle both. Acknowledging white privilege is not enforcing the idea that white people are better than black people. White privilege is prevalent in our society because of the discriminatory laws and oppression that black people face and are still facing.  Ignoring white privilege or claiming that it isn't real is ignoring systemic racism and oppression to make you feel more comfortable. I want to make it very clear that the school is in no way teaching us that white people are bad. The only purpose is to bring awareness to these kinds of issues. Those of you who think that the county is pushing a political agenda or narrative.  The idea that being anti-racist is somehow an attack on your political or religious views because it promotes being against bigotry is disgusting. If being racist is considered a political view to you and you agree with that political view, then you're just racist. Using politics or religion to excuse and offend bigotry is hindering our efforts as a community to make Black and LGBTQ people feel safe and accepted.  The responsibility of advocating for Black lives should fall onto everyone, including White people, and we should use our privilege to speak up about such issues. The one-sided viewpoint some of you have referred to is the viewpoint that empathy and acceptance are important, and I personally think that that is a pretty good view to be teaching the students. Having these kinds of conversations in our school is so important because it shows our students how to combat and recognize racism within and out of our school environment.  Black people do not get to opt out of being Black or being discriminated against because of their skin color. So white people should not be allowed to opt out of acknowledging it. Thank you.",

My name is Sarah Harris, and I'm here again tonight to voice my strong support for courageous conversations in particular, and anti-racism and LGBTQ inclusion in ACPS in general. Several of us drafted an open letter in support of the board's commitment to equity and inclusion in ACPS, which you've already heard about. More than 700 members of our community, including parents, educators, and administrators have signed it in just the last week. The letter's in your inbox.  We're grateful for the work that educators, students, county leadership, and the school board have already done, such as creating a strategic plan that centers on equity, implementing the anti-racism policy through lessons and classroom practices and materials, and providing professional development for teachers and staff in CRT, which we all know means culturally responsive teaching.  And we're proud of where the county is heading. With the forthcoming approval and implementation of the policy on the treatment of transgender and gender expansive students in schools, which is required prior to the start of the next school year, ACPS is sending a clear message of acceptance and celebration of our LGBTQ students.  As for the opinion that it should be the parents, not the students having these conversations, we have been for years. We've been listening and learning and making important progress. It's why these policies are in place and it's how these laws have been passed. The list of signatures includes over 125 students, indicating their eagerness to have these conversations.  But they too have been doing this work for years. Students were instrumental in the development of the anti-racism policy. So don't underestimate them or what they can handle. None of this is new. None of this should be controversial. Albemarle County Public Schools is firmly and categorically on the right side of history with this adoption of these policies and the implementation of this curriculum. And the vast majority of the community supports this critical work. So stay strong, stay focused, and thank you.",

Tonight I want to present a letter or petition to the school board. I want to be clear that I did not personally author this petition, but I am a signatory. I was asked by a collection of parents to present it to the board and I do so tonight with great respect for the diverse viewpoints of many caring parents.  On Monday, June 7, this petition was created to request transparency, discussion, and community engagement regarding the Courageous Conversations pilot at Henley. It also asks that this pilot be paused until there is an opportunity for transparency and discussion. In just three days, the petition is now nearing 300 signatures.  The signatories are over 18 years of age. They do not include children. The petition was translated into Spanish to advance the important goal of being as inclusive as possible for our Albemarle County residents. I ask us all to keep in mind and respect that the signatories no doubt have their own reasons for signing the petition. We come from different political and religious views and from a variety of life experiences.  Though our differences may be many, there is in fact one strong voice with respect to this pilot. I would like to read a portion of our petition. As diverse members of the Albemarle County community, we join our neighbors in supporting a learning environment for our children that is free from discrimination, hate, exclusion, and bullying of any kind.  We are concerned about the new Courageous Conversations program being piloted at Henley, and whether it is the right way to achieve the above goals we are all united in supporting. We, the undersigned members of the Albemarle County Public School community, are writing to request a pause in any future and broader implementation of the program to allow adequate time for one, a comprehensive fact-driven and balanced analysis, and review of program content by key stakeholders.  including parents. And number two, open public conversations and forums to discuss the materials. As a first step, we ask the board to hold a town hall where the components of the pilot can be presented to the public in questions asked. We also request that quantitative feedback from the pilot be shared, including the performance metrics for the program, its original goals, and how success is being measured. Mr. Clady,",

Based on what I've heard from other parents, I have some major concerns, however, like most parents, I need a lot more information from you. You failed to communicate your intentions and process to us. Now I hope it's not the case.  but it seems like you're attempting to implement a controversial unproven program as quickly and quietly as possible without the required due diligence and without including the parents and taxpayers. Where is the transparency, the communication? Where is the inclusive community discussion? Where are the town halls, the surveys and comment periods? How could you possibly think it might be acceptable to roll out something like this without a minimum of one town hall per district?  Why are you excluding the very community you're supposed to serve? And where's the data from the pilot program, which conveniently was implemented at the 11th hour during a pandemic while parents were distracted and juggling more balls than ever?  What were the target outcomes? Were they achieved? How were they measured? As a parent, I want what's best for my children, but your lack of due diligence has excluded me from a top secret process. Was that your intent? I'm requesting that you take a timeout on the rushed rollout of this program to communicate with us transparently. Give us a chance to review the data, to ask questions and provide feedback. Give us a chance to weigh in on what's best for our children. I'm also requesting that you invite us parents  to have some courageous conversations during town halls before introducing content from your controversial pilot program to any additional classrooms.

    "text": "Good evening. I'm a mother of two ACPS elementary students.  When I first heard rumblings of the Courageous Conversation pilot program at Henley, the information was hearsay. I began to ask parents who had students at Henley, and they knew very little, which was even more concerning. As I began to dig in and ultimately saw the slides of the curriculum, I was shocked to say the least. My concern is the apparent deceit or at a minimum lack of transparency between the school and parents. It made me question what high schoolers and elementary students are being taught behind our backs.  Regardless of the content of the curriculum, the big red flag here is the process and the lack of transparency. Why is this being hidden? Why does a slide presented to our eighth graders say, and quote, what is said in our classroom must stay in our class community? Surely we all agree that these are minors and parents have legal and moral rights to the care and control of their underage children. I implore all parents to consider this. What happens when the day comes, and it will, that you're on the other side of agreeing with the curriculum in schools?  Won't you want to know that the precedent has been set for a methodical process where materials are shared, feedback is received, and a respectful conversation and decision is reached? Don't you want to know that your children's safety comes first to our school leaders? What's the rush on this program? What's the big secret? Nothing is gained by rushing. Slow down, press pause, and be transparent with parents. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you.  Hello, I'm Christine Koenig, a Brownsville parent. I'm confused and frustrated. I watched the last school board meeting I was confused by all the parent comments about a pilot program at a school my child will attend in a few years. I am familiar with the culturally responsive teaching at ECPS and from what I have personally seen and heard I believe it is a good and valuable program.  Critical race theory is a new term for me, and I had to Google it. Honestly, I'm still not sure I understand it. Courageous Conversations is apparently a new pilot program at Henley, but I couldn't find anything about it on the ACPS website, so I Googled it. And links to local news articles and websites I've never visited before came up. There I found what were referred to as leaked materials. Were they truly leaked? If so, why were they not meant to be shared with parents? I reviewed the quote leaked PowerPoints, and it seemed to have some good slides about bias and others that may stimulate really powerful conversations.  There are also slides that I'm not quite sure what they're trying to get at. So I want to know more so I can understand. So my questions are, will all materials in this new curriculum be shared with parents? Were there and will there be opportunities for parent feedback across all of ACPS? And has ACPS engaged in accumulating feedback from diverse parent populations across the county and not just Henley parents? How is this pilot program being evaluated? And what are the measurable success criteria, both for the pilot and the program moving forward? When and how will the decision be made to roll it out to other schools?  I'm frustrated that I don't have direct and detailed information from ACPS on anything related to this program and all I have is Google. I'm sure other parents like me are waiting for this communication from ACPS, especially since this new curriculum has made national news and is creating controversy.  Finally, what kind of training were teachers given to implement courageous conversations? Is it true that teachers were given the materials just 10 days before they were being required to teach it? Were teachers given any training in how to guide the discussion so it doesn't go in a harmful direction? Are teachers being given the support they need to make this a positive learning experience for all? We are supposed to be creating safe spaces for our children and to have these important and sensitive conversations. And without the proper tools and training to support our teachers, you could end up traumatizing and re-traumatizing some of our most vulnerable and at-risk students.  These conversations are so important, so let's take the time to do it right. Slow down, involve parents in the community, set metrics for success, and actually give teachers the support and training they need to make it successful. We can't afford to get this wrong and destroy any progress that has already been made. Thank you for listening.",

    "text": " Thanks Katrina. My name is Nathan Moore from Rio District and my kids had some very good years at Woodbrook Elementary. A year ago, I would have said my two girls instead of my two kids because my two kids were both born biologically female. My older child, who's now 12 years old, came out to me as a trans boy in December. That was an adjustment for sure, but I am so proud to have Charlie as my son and so proud of his courage.  Because what really matters in all this is that all of our kids in Alamaro County feel loved and that they feel supported, not just by their dads and their moms, but by their community.  What matters is for all of our kids to be able to lead free and flourishing lives. As they grow into adolescence and then young adulthood, they need to be physically safe. They need to be economically secure. They need to feel heard and understood and feel a sense of belonging. And it's our job to tear down the structural walls that exclude some people from living those free and flourishing lives. That's why I support initiatives like Courageous Conversations, that curriculum, as well as Albemarle County's overall efforts to engage in culturally responsive teaching.  And I just want to comment for a minute. There are people on the right who don't like this model, and they're egged on by media outlets that are literally fascist. These people think it's perfectly fine for some kids to feel unsafe, just not theirs. For some kids to experience discrimination, just not theirs. For some kids to be pushed out of the resources that our society offers, just not theirs. But they know they can't say those things here in polite society. So instead, they go on and on and on about process, right? They're wrong.  As a school system, please continue to support culturally responsive teaching, and please keep making that Courageous Conversations pilot program better and better. Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "Hello, my name is Sam Parks from the Whitehall District, and I bring the perspective tonight of a homeschooling parent. Through the past year, a number of families have confided in us  that they're pulling their children out of Albemarle County schools, often after witnessing what their children were taught virtually. For example, one family witnessed their second grader being taught that people are sometimes not the gender they were assigned at birth, and that if they have a funny feeling in their belly right now, maybe they are one of those people. Finding these and other lessons to be manipulative, psychologically destabilizing, and certainly usurping of their parental role, these parents remove their children from their schools quietly, lest they be labeled bigots.  Board, I've reviewed the Courageous Conversations curriculum, and rather than make pronouncements, I want to ask you to consider a few questions. One, will students formed by this curriculum be more likely to treat others as unique individuals or instead see others as stand-ins for an identity group? Two, are students likely to emerge more emotionally resilient, more graceful with others, or will they be less so, more likely to find trauma or grievance in everyday conflicts and disappointments? Three,  Will students emerge with more of a sense of belonging, a shared common identity? Or will they feel further fractured into identity groups, groups almost designed to be antagonistic? Four, will our minority students emerge more ennobled and enabled to participate in American civic life? Or will they have had the expectation reinforced that the odds are stacked against them? Five, will teaching our white students that their skin corresponds with privilege and oppression  make them less or more vulnerable to the seductions of white nationalism. Members of the board, search your hearts and be honest with yourselves. You have been entrusted with the molding of young minds. Do not be cowed by a cultural zeitgeist, but know that history will not look kindly on this. It is not too late for you to do the right thing. Open this curriculum up to transparent community review and know that to fear doing so is the surest sign that something is very amiss. Thank you.",

    "text": "All right, I would like to start off by telling you all a story. I have two lesbian mothers. I first experienced homophobia when I was in kindergarten. We were talking about our families and I mentioned that I have two mothers. I was told by another child that I couldn't have two mothers and that I must have a mother and father.  all throughout my elementary school years, I was ostracized, always asked who my quote unquote real dad was, or who was like the dad in my parents' relationship. It got worse in middle school and all the way up to high school where I have been called slurs. So here's what I have to say.  If your child is old enough to say hurtful and hateful things, they are old enough to learn that what they're saying is not okay. And people trying to prevent that from being taught are enabling and supporting bullying and hate. I was going to speak my mind. I was going to speak on my support.  of the anti-racism policies, but I believe Madeline Benedict has said what I wanted to say, so I'm just going to second that. I would, however, like to say that if a person has a problem with their child learning how to not be racist, they might be racist themselves. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hello, Sean Johnson Whitehall district. I want to talk about the critical race theory instruction that's being proposed.  We have three kids with one currently at Henley. Our kids are not racist, never have been. They've never told us that they feel racism or lack of inclusion or issues in their schools. They're not confused about racism, religion, or their gender. They are well aware that racism does exist in many shapes and forms. I've reviewed the materials that you intend on sharing with the students at Henley and do not approve.  This material contains many false assumptions and that's many important facts and will lead kids to many wrong conclusions. Your student presentation material for eighth graders, for example, was designed to create reactions from students that fit your social engineering goals on slide 53 of the eighth grade material.  You point out that black men are more likely to be in prison than white men. Also that black men are more likely to be killed by police. What is missing are important facts that put these stats in a real context. According to the FBI in 2019 black men accounted for 56% of all homicides, while the whole black population was only 14% of the US.  The FBI also reported that an overall per capita offending rates for black men was six times higher than white men. There's much more data available that really shows the whole picture, yet in developing your program you have cherry picked convenient statistics to perpetuate a radical false narrative.  On slide 38, a biracial couple answers questions about white privilege. One of the questions asks if you've ever had to teach your children how to not get killed by police. Any common sense parent knows that children need to be caught to obey laws and respect law enforcement. I have forwarded that material to both police chief Ron Lance and Sheriff Jan Bailey just recently this week, so waiting for comment from them.  Finally, I do want to thank the Citizens Advocating Responsible Education of Alamaro County. In only a few days, this group has grown dramatically and has become very well organized. Mr. Johnson, your time is over. Okay, thank you.",

In my opinion, I think it's great for teachers to talk about anti-racism in school because learning our history is important. It's not as hard as one might think. One way it would be helpful is being taught the history of how people came up with the vocabulary for racial slurs and how not to and and why not to use them.  There are many people who are educated about slurs and their history. So allowing the teachers teach the history of slur words is important. The teacher can show a documentary about how people came up with the slurs and why they are used. I know slur words are offensive, but why do people use them so much to hurt other people? Why can't this be acknowledged? Thank you.  Thank you for this time, for your time.",

    "text": "Thanks. My name is Scott Guggenheimer, a parent of two students at Henley Middle School.  Both my students are white. I don't think they have a ton of firsthand experience with feeling excluded because of their identity. They show up at Henley Middle School and they are loved and valued and affirmed and challenged. And they're having a wonderful academic experience. I cherish it. I'm grateful for it. I think they'll build on that academic experience, whatever sort of life they want to live. And when I reflect on that, three things occur to me.  First, not all kids in our schools are having that same type of experience. Secondly, we can't really have a fair democracy if not all of our young people are having an academic experience in which they can build whatever sort of life they want to live. We can't have a just society without an inclusive school system.  And third, the aspirations that the school board has articulated in the anti-racism policy, the work that educators have been doing for years to become more culturally responsive in their teaching, and the work being done at Henley Middle School to start having conversations about race and identity. These efforts don't take anything away from my kids. Being more inclusive, having more affirmation and more love for some young people does not mean less of anything for other young people.  In fact, it's more of everything for all young people more opportunities to relate to other people, more skill building for navigating complex problems from a diverse perspective, a deeper appreciation of our skills and  both individually and collectively. So I continue to support the school board's anti-racism policy. It's so exciting to hear that over 700 people feel the same way. And I'm so glad that Henley Middle School has started to have courageous conversations in their classrooms. Thanks.",

Growing up in the Western feeder pattern, most of my friends and most of my fellow students and many of my teachers were white, unlike me. I learned that sometimes even a really friendly and caring school doesn't feel friendly and welcoming when your race sets you apart. For example, it's hard to feel like a recognizable individual when teachers regularly get you mixed up with the only other Asian kid in your grade.  I go to Albemarle now, and one big change that I liked was that there are so many different types of people with different types of names and backgrounds. I don't think Western and Henley are responsible for changing the population of the schools, and I don't think they should. But I support the Albemarle County Public Schools anti-racism policies and LGBTQIA inclusion work.  because these policies might help make schools really welcoming for people who don't match the majority of people at that school, the way I didn't. One last thing. Tonight, I am listening to a lot of adults who are scared of having students and teachers talk about race and identity. But as an Asian American, I can't escape these topics.  And I need my teachers and peers to know how to have those conversations with me and when I'm around and feel safe having them. I want to thank ACPS for continuing to recognize and support curriculum like Courageous Conversations. Thank you.",

First, I applaud the creation of the community working group that began meeting last night to work on the Mountain View overcrowding issue. I want to bring forward data to help you as you work to decide where our children will spend their first full school year since the middle of third grade. It's not easy to find studies on fifth graders in middle school. However, the 2008 paper, the negative impacts of starting middle school in sixth grade is telling.  The authors found that students who attend middle school in sixth grade are twice as likely to be disciplined and perform worse on standardized test scores than their counterparts in elementary school. According to the study, the results suggest that exposing sixth graders to older peers has persistent negative consequences on their academic outcomes. This is important because no matter how the day would be structured for fifth graders at Walton, many of the children would spend nearly two hours a day on a bus with eighth graders.  This study was based on sixth graders. It's not a stretch to extrapolate the effect on fifth graders would be at least as negative. According to the VDE Offense Frequency Report, over the past five years, Walton had nearly two times as many offenders per capita as any other middle school in the county, primarily substance and behavioral offenses. Over one student in 10 is disciplined each year. Meanwhile, Mountain View Elementary School has reported no offenders over the same five-year period.  If we combine the existing disciplinary situation at Walton with the findings of the cited study, we must conclude that sending our rising fifth graders who have spent nearly a year and a half outside of school to Walton is setting them up for failure and trauma that will likely follow them for the rest of their academic careers. Overcrowding in the building at Mountain View cannot be the only factor, nor should it be the primary driver in determining where our children spend their final year of elementary school.  Based on this data, the school system should consider every other possibility, including learning cottages in the bus loop and or using the Boys and Girls Club offered space to reduce overcrowding before putting nine and 10 year olds on a bus unsupervised for up to two hours a day with 13 and 14 year olds.

    "text": "Yes, Matthew Marzyewski, great job. Whitehall District. ACPS policies state that, quote, children and youth function best when there's clear and cooperative communication between the home and the school.  And I'm here tonight to say this has not occurred with the Henley Courageous Conversations pilot. Indeed, just yesterday, a survey was emailed to the Henley students to gather feedback on the eighth grade program. Not only were parents not surveyed, they were not even made aware that the survey was being sent.  And for the majority of this year's pilot, the website has read that the eighth grade units are forthcoming for the CCAR program. As of today, those slides have been uploaded, so thank you for that. But these are not the same slides that my child was actually presented in units one and two in the classroom. So my question is, where is the cooperation, trust, and transparency? The pattern seems to be to err on the side of secrecy instead of transparency. You've heard that theme a bit.  If I'm wrong, please prove it to the community that holding multiple town halls will expose and dispel that statement and hold them over the next few months, please. Second, quantitative evidence of success and failures must be presented in this forum, I request. The pilot was rushed to implement in secret, but worse, without key performance indicators. Why do I say that? A parent recently asked the Henley administration in a public forum  How does the teacher know that they've met daily weekly and big vision goals to which the administration responded I quote.  we don't have a very good measure for advisory. We give the kids surveys. They give us feedback. And so that's really going to be some of it. And it will almost be all qualitative in what the kids say. And they've been saying all along, it's not like a unit test or something that we plan to give. So the majority of our measure of success is going to be qualitative feedback in the form of writing for kids that check in. But one of the things we could have done better we didn't do is a pretest that we could have something that we  That might have been a stronger element, end quote. So I urge the pause of these rollouts. Host multiple town halls, please, over the next few months. Parents in other districts, you've heard from some of them, are severely unaware of the program and transparency should reach them too. And personally, I have a lot of positive ideas, productive ideas that I think can help these kids and meet all the goals that you're hearing from both sides, honestly, on this topic.  it can't fit into two minutes. We should come together and share those ideas, brainstorm, build on them as a community. So that's my urge to you. Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Hi, good evening. My name is Laurie Tamburino.  and I'm the parent of a rising fifth grader at Mountain View Elementary School. I'm here tonight to once again ring the alarm regarding the proposed move of fifth graders to Walton for the 2021-2022 school year. When I spoke at the meeting on May 27, I begged the administration to put together a working group to address the urgent issue so an alternate plan could be put in place. A work group was in fact organized  and I hopefully watched the live stream last night. As the meeting progressed, however, it became painfully obvious that the administration's goal with this work group is not to solve the problem, but instead to run out the clock on making a different plan for the fifth graders at Mountain View for the upcoming school year. Then they could say that they tried, but it's too late to implement a different plan for the 2021-2022 school year.  and ship the fifth graders off to Walton as originally planned. And the people that would bear the brunt of that decision would be the rising fifth graders, one of which is my child. But I'm not here to advocate for my child tonight. The painful fact is that my white middle class child will be fine regardless of what decision is made for the 21-22 school year. She's not battling things that some of her classmates are having to.  such as food insecurity and housing insecurity. The families that will be most negatively affected by this proposed change are not being heard by the county's administration, the school members and the community at large. So I'd like to read some of the comments that came out of last night's work group regarding what is important to them about being at Mountain View for the 21-22 school year. One parent said,  Many families in my community are unable to be with kids in the morning to get the bus. We need the schedule to work for families with single parents or for families that have issues with transportation. Another parent said, we need our kids to have good experiences with the teachers. The teachers in Mountain View are supportive. They understand our community. They are great at communicating with me in Spanish when I need them to.  And finally, one of the most heartbreaking comments, my family needs to not fight this hard to keep our kids from suffering more than they already have. I once again implore the Albemarle County Public School Administration to treat this with the urgency that it deserves and develop a strong working plan to keep the rising fifth graders in their school home at Mountain View for the 21-22 school year.",

I want to be honest, I support better protection for LGBTQ students from discrimination. We must always work to protect the dignity and worth of every human person, especially our youth. However, ACPS outright endorsing gender fluidity as the one correct view is not the same thing as protecting one against discrimination. If this curriculum continues, it has two possibilities for my children.  One, stay quiet, keep their head down, or two, change their beliefs. The message sent from their very own tax-funded school and staff is clear. There is only one set of correct beliefs, and what your Christian religion teaches is wrong.  For everyone speaking out like I am today, there's another 50 who are too afraid that they will be fired from their jobs, ostracized from their community, all this from the very curriculum that is geared towards fighting discrimination. As published research has shown, anti-racism training often causes divisiveness and does not authentically meet the goal set before it. Rather, studies show missions unite. I'd like to give you a concrete example.  My child had the delight of presenting a multi-week group project at school. The students, when placed together, worked hard in trying to present a cohesive argument. It was mock trial. In this small group of students, I couldn't be more proud of how well they worked together on a common goal. What is noteworthy about this is that these students have incredibly different held values, identities, and beliefs.  They all completely respected one another and were kind to one another. This is what we need. Not more conversations led by the school with a magnifying glass on their differences. Courageous conversations is not a common mission. It is a forced mission from a particular set of beliefs. Our kids are not to be experimented on. I hope the school board will correct course and learn from these courageous conflicts. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi, I'm Matt Anderson. I have two daughters at Henley Middle School.  At the last board meeting, I asked whether ACPS was introducing curricula that is based in whole or in part on critical race theory. I would like to be clear, I was not talking about culturally responsive teaching. I'm asking about critical race theory as the basis or underpinnings of your anti-racism initiatives. I've been performing further analysis of ACPS materials. I believe I've probably answered my own question, but I'm still interested in a publicly available statement from ACPS.  To me, it seems clear that ACPS is introducing curricula that is based at least in part on critical race theory. It is also clear to me that you're working at foundational levels with materials that include some unhealthy indoctrination. This may not be as apparent to you, but it is to me as an ex-CULT member. When you combine bad forms of us versus them social identity teachings with some additional unhealthy indoctrination, you have a recipe that can produce bad outcomes in the lives of children.  You can also lay the foundation for new kinds of racism between American social groups under initiatives labeled anti-racism, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Labels like these do not mean a lot to ex-cult members like me. We know how to look past the labels towards the substance and to consider the side effects of people's good intentions. In the end, it is not just about good intention. It is the overall effect, which can nullify good intentions. I believe fair and open discourse will help demonstrate that my concerns have merit.  Please do not misconstrue my concerns. I'm not invalidating the problems you're trying to solve or the goals you're setting to create a fair inclusive environment without racism. I also know your desire to improve the educational performance for key groups that have consistently underperformed for years. I'm with you for these goals. However, I'm calling attention to problems in your methodology and approach. In other words, I see and understand your intentions. I do believe your intentions are good, but today I'm cautioning you as someone with knowledge and experience from cult environments, that your best intentions are not enough.  Thank you for your time, and I appreciate the opportunity to share.",

    "text": " And I'm Jody Harrison, I have a child at Henley and I'm reading on behalf of Dr. Carlos who cannot be here tonight. And there's his letter, dear members of the Admiral accounting school board. My name is Dr. Carlos, or Ben is and I'm writing you out of concern, the addition of the courageous conversations to the school curriculum.  My wife Tatiana and I legally immigrated to this country, many years ago, in hopes of providing our children a brighter future and freedoms we were not allowed, having grown up in a socialist military dictatorship in Central America.  We have experienced firsthand what government indoctrination is like and the helplessness of not being allowed to disagree or have an individual opinion other than the official version. Our children have been enrolled in ACPS since we moved here 13 years ago. Our oldest son is a product of ACPS, was in all AP classes and has successfully completed his first year at Johns Hopkins University. Our second son is a freshman at Western, is taking multiple AP classes and is a straight A student.  Our daughter is currently a student at Henley Middle School, will be in eighth grade next year and is also doing well in class. None of us have ever had any incident or issue with discrimination or racial bias of any kind in the time that we have been here. So the courageous conversations wanting to label my children as victims or subservient to a more privileged or dominant race is not accurate in our experience. Asking my children to label themselves as such would be in our case, racist in nature.  The entire concept of placing fault or blame or the need to feel guilty simply because of race, the color of skin, sex, or gender identity would violate the premises of individual rights, equal opportunity, and individual merit that my wife and I so highly coveted when we came to this country and have instilled in our children at home.  Tatiana and I have seen the modules that will be presented during eighth grade, and we strongly disagree with several points that are mentioned. Forcing those on our child without allowing us to opt out is an overreach by the school system, would amount to indoctrination as we know it, and at least an open and transparent discussion on the matter is warranted.",

    "text": " Thank you. Father of three students in the system in two districts and two more coming. The modern pace of social change, how it's changed in my lifetime alone is almost dizzying. I think it's fair and honest, and in fact, necessary to acknowledge that this can be challenging, messy, scary even. But we're faced here with a moral decision, a civil decision, one where we either address our complicated feelings about race, gender, sexuality, and religion for the good of our whole community,  or accept the status quo at the expense of those who are just gaining a voice, or those who have always struggled to be heard, to have a true cultural representation. So I see as a moral imperative, a civil rights imperative, the need to re-examine our country's complicated past with regards to race, to acknowledge the scientific community's modern understanding of gender and sexuality, to celebrate diversity as a source for greater strength in our community,  This conversation, of course, begins in our homes with our families, but that's not enough. It must continue in our schools. Indeed, it will in some form or another, whether we want it to or not. So it's our responsibility to frame this conversation in a way that doesn't perpetuate discrimination, neglect, marginalization. The conversation must continue with our educators and how they're empowered as advocates for all members of the community.  It seems now that social justice and religious freedom are sometimes strangely at odds. But I ask, how are the issues we're discussing today morally distinct from those faced by my parents' generation when debating school desegregation? For all this, which for me simply amounts to matters of justice and equality,  I support, along with the other 700 signatures, planned initiatives to make our schools more inclusive and equitable for all.

Nothing should be woven into the curriculum without parental consent.  Our children are our children. They do not belong to the school board. They do not belong to the schools they attend. They do not belong to their principals. They do not belong to their teachers, and they do not belong to other parents in our community.

    "text": "Great, thank you. The fact that parents are rising up against equity and anti-racism is a direct result of ACPS's inability to effectively engage the community with a clear operationalized anti-racism strategy. For over two years,  This administration and some of the current board members continually pushed back on anti racist efforts to ban Confederate imagery and struggled to clearly declare a CPS as an anti racist school system you reap what you sow.  Because of ineffective community engagement and dysfunctional communication strategies, ACPS and anti-racist educators and community members are now being doxed and targeted by a global right-wing audience that was invited into this community through many of the speakers that spoke earlier this evening against the Courageous Conversations program. You reap what you sow.  Because ACPS is not fully and authentically grounded in intersectional anti-racist work, the rights of Black, Indigenous, and people of color, as well as LGBTQ plus students and educators is at risk. It's time to reckon with the ongoing coddling of racist white families in this school system.  Why is it easier to coordinate brutal police attacks on anti-racist parents than to shut down the destructive racist attitudes of bigoted white parents? If you replace the words courageous conversation or anti-racism with desegregation, when you listen to each of those speakers speak, you will hear exactly the same messages that have been around since the dawn of time, as well as specifically 60 years ago during the civil rights and desegregation movement.  I don't know how long you expect us to beg to keep our children safe. In the words of Lerone Bennett, Jr., an educator in a system of oppression is either a revolutionary or an oppressor.

And I'm thrilled to have been able to sign on to the letter submitted tonight in support of CCAR. It was especially meaningful to me that those who have signed onto the letter include not just parents, but teachers, administrators, doctors, mental health providers, counselors, adults who run programs for kids in our community, and most importantly, students.  There are more of us out there, and we are 100% committed to supporting the school division and the board in this work. I also wanted to speak to a misconception floating around on social media recently culturally relevant teaching is not critical race theory, and I feel I can speak to this because I sat in.  on culturally relevant teacher training modules and a book study put on by ACPS this spring. I learned a ton and I would strongly encourage anyone who has concerns or questions to reach out to ACPS to find out how to get involved. At its essence, culturally responsive teaching is about investing in learning and understanding who students are and what they bring to the table and how best to support them in becoming independent learners.  I think that if parents who are concerned take time to really understand what ACPS is doing, they'll see that it's not what national media outlets or people outside our county say it is. I think what they'll see is that our teachers are doing an amazing work. I also want to address the idea that Henley is acting as a renegade with this CCAR curriculum. It's just false. This curriculum was developed with input from around the county.  And this curriculum was discussed at every monthly meeting that Dr. Costa had for us since January. I also just want to take a moment to shout out to the Student Equity Advisory Team. These students have hosted two amazing panels that show how much agency, empowerment, empathy, and passion they are bringing to the work that they are doing. I was so grateful to be a part of those.  And finally, to the parents who are asking why we can't just wait and slow things down, I would just refer them back to James Baldwin, who in the 1980s asked, how much time must we wait for your progress?

Last month, I had the opportunity to attend a two-day training with Dr. Kenneth Hardy that was organized by the Counseling Alliance of Virginia called Race Matters. He facilitated what you might call a courageous conversation with a range of local professionals working with children and families. I would like to share one concept that he highlighted in relation to the recent backlash that we're hearing tonight to the county's efforts to serve all students, in particular those at the margins, with dignity and respect.  It's the distinction between safety and comfort. Dr. Hardy stated, everyone is entitled to safety. No one is entitled to comfort. The courageous conversations about identity and understanding and celebrating differences might have some people feeling uncomfortable. Does that mean we shouldn't be having those conversations? When our child is struggling to understand a concept or complete an assignment, do we prioritize their comfort  over what we know they need to learn. For too long, the safety of marginalized students in ACPS has been compromised because of the priority of comfort for white, cisgendered, able-bodied, straight students and community members. ACPS is on the right track with the anti-racism policies, professional development, curriculum, and hiring decisions. We must prioritize the safety of the most marginalized, not the comfort of the privileged. Thank you.",

I'm commenting this evening in support of the Courageous Conversation Program, ACPS's anti-racism policy, full intersectional support of LGBTQ youth, and culturally responsive teaching within the ACPS district.  The concerned group of citizens and parents from Albemarle County who are organizing as citizens advocating for responsible education or care do not represent me or hundreds of others who had signed on to the petition mentioned before. And that group of citizens should not be allowed to act as the arbiters of what constitutes responsible or education. Discomfort, as mentioned just in the comment before mine, is different than harm.  Your family's opinions do not negate the existence or the lived reality of students and families in Albemarle County and the harm that racism and bigotry has caused them within this school system. Pausing the implementation of anti-racist goals in order to placate a portion of the community who benefit from the status quo is not a neutral action. A lack of anti-racist action is not neutral.  There's a reason this is a contentious issue, because whether benevolent or overt, our culture is deeply rooted in white supremacy. We need to pull it out by the roots.

Both of our adult children are upset at how little they learned in school, with a couple of exceptions, about the history of Black, Latinx, Native, and Asian Americans, and about the omissions and outright falsehoods they learned about how white Americans interacted with these groups of people.  Most white citizens of Albemarle County do not routinely interact with people of color, except possibly in the workplace and rarely in situations of equality. And yet they do not even realize how much richer their lives would be if they did. Even though our schools are not segregated, many classes pretty much are.  We need to give all our kids the knowledge and skills they need to interact with all of their peers, valuing the inherent worth and dignity of each other. We need the Courageous Conversations program for all students. And this is from my husband, Frank Dukes. He works with leaders from all around the state.

First, to those responsible for the recently circulated letter that calls for the barring of an opt-out option for the LGBTQIA plus curricula, your letter serves to highlight an important truth, that there are some issues so foundational to the health and well-being of our children, that the appropriate course of action is not compromise, but to fight for what we know to be true, not only for our own children, but for all of the children in our community.  And on this point, I agree wholeheartedly with the signers of this petition and their allies.  However, it is here that my agreement ends. I firmly believe, as many other parents and teachers in this county, that a true and therefore healthy understanding of human gender and sexuality is founded on the laws of nature and nature's God, that we are created male and female, that as such our biological sex and gender are inextricably bound, and therefore any attempt to divide them does not bring health and well-being to our children, but rather deep psychological and physical harm, and harm that is often irreparable.  So I say to those parents of like mind, it's not enough to come to the table begging for scraps. It's not enough to merely ask for the preservation of your opt out. It's time to fight for our children with the same clarity and determination as those who brought forward this petition. It's time to demand that our schools promote in their curriculum policies, the understanding that we are all born male and female and that gender cannot be separated from this binary reality without causing lasting harm.  If you care about the children of this county and Commonwealth do not stay on the sidelines, it is time to understand what you believe why you believe it and then fight for it. If Albemarle County Public Schools choose to inculcate your children with theories of sexuality and gender that threaten their health and well being.  Then it's time to wake up and pull your children out of the public school system. For this, for many, this will require deep personal sacrifice. But what treasure lays greater claim on our honor and sacred duty than the very hearts, minds, and souls of our children? Thank you.",

However, I am asking, along with my other colleagues, that Albemarle County consider halting the rollout of courageous conversations about race in order to allow us to have the chance, us as parents and community members, to work together to develop a more academic and inclusive education and program for our children.  Looking at the definitions within this system, within this program, bias is defined as unfairly showing favoritism towards something or someone. That's a very reductionist definition of bias. When you see on the University of Minnesota's  psychological school, they list 12 different cognitive biases to include anchoring bias, which is the overwhelming reliance on the first piece of information obtained and using it as a baseline for comparison, all the way to recency effect or recency bias in which recent events are easier to remember and therefore placed more heavily weighted than others.

    "text": "Hi, good evening.  I wanted to speak tonight about the courageous conversations. I actually have four children in the Whitehall District, two at Henley and two at Brownsville. I personally welcome conversations about race and identity. Within the Henley community, as well as the school itself, however, my experiences and perspective are usually unwelcome, labeled as ignorant and unjustified, and most often are met with hostility and aggressive rhetoric.  The third principle of the county's anti-racism policy states explicitly that the board commits to respecting and championing the diversity and life experiences of all community members. The Henley community is failing at this, and the pervasive school of thought is robbing those of us with differing opinions and perspectives of feeling unwelcome in our own town, robbing us of our freedom of speech, and is attempting to rob us of the power to educate our children on the very sensitive topics of identity and race.  complex constructs that even adults have difficulty dissecting and analyzing. Despite this, Henley announced the courageous conversations on race curriculum on a Thursday with expected implementation the following week. Omission of documentation left parents with no choice but to make a gut decision as to whether to opt in or opt out. There was no time for educated decision making. Parents were simply expected to accept the decision that had been made on their behalf.  If the county feels so strongly that this curriculum is instrumental in quote eliminating racism in the division. Why not be completely transparent, why not provide parents with all material prior to implementation, so that we can more effectively help our children become citizens to quote practice identifying challenging and changing the value structures and behaviors that perpetuate systemic racism.  Wouldn't such transparency help parents educate their children on how to as laid out in the county's anti racist policy.  become a lifelong learner who actively seeks new information and opportunities to grow in one's understanding about race and racism? How can we help our children to be upstanders, challenging and disrupting practices that perpetuate racism and maintain power if we don't have access to the curriculum prior to implementation? Was there ever any intention to promote conversations about identity and race, or was it simply an edict being imposed upon the parents of this community? Thank you.",

Our children are growing up in a community where we have Confederate statues coming down, thankfully.  and where we debate the role of police. They're growing up in a community that is still recovering from the horrors of the Unite the Right rally and where they see Black Lives Matter signs in their neighbor's yards. I think it's critical that the schools provide a safe place for students to learn about and discuss these issues. In our home, we talk about systemic racism, but in school, my kids will be able to hear from other students and teachers who have different experiences than our white family.  So I applaud Albemarle County Public Schools for exploring this issue, and I wanna urge the school board to support an anti-racist curriculum for all students. Thank you.",

As of today, Albemarle County, seven day floating or moving average number of new cases for one hundred thousand people is one point four.  The seven-day moving average of cases has been increasing for the past 13 days, which does not exceed the threshold of 14 days. So this is considered a fluctuating trend. However, I believe these are some of the lowest numbers we've reported. The seven-day moving average for the percent of COVID cases that were positive  is 1.8%. This indicator has been decreasing for eight days, which does not exceed that threshold. So this is also considered a fluctuating trend. For the city of Charlottesville, the seven day floating average as of today is, or as of yesterday is 1.2. And this  indicator has been increasing, although very slightly, for the past 19 days. So this is considered an increasing trend. The seven-day moving average of the percent of COVID tests that were positive in the city of Charlottesville was 1.1%. This number has been increasing for the past 25 days, so it's also considered an increasing trend. But these are also very low numbers compared to what we had throughout the pandemic.  In Albemarle County, public schools have had very good numbers. We've only had reported two cases in the last month. So the cases have fallen a lot in Albemarle County. And then at UVA, they've had very few cases. They've had two since the end of the spring semester. Our youth vaccination rates are continuing to climb. We have an estimated 44.8% of  all those in Albemarle County in the 10 to 19 age group who have had at least one dose. But if you take out the 10 and 11 year olds, that would be 57% of our students age 12 to 19 have had at least one dose. And 36, almost 37% of our students in that age group are fully vaccinated at this point.  Turn it back over to you, Dr. McLaughlin.",

So as you recall, we look at the numbers one more way from the CDC core indicators, which look at the total number of new cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days and the percent positivity over the past seven days.  And you can see that those indicators are at the moderate level for the case incidence rate and at the low level for the percent positivity that's here. And so that puts us into the moderate range. This number, what we're tending to see on a seven-day cumulative average  is numbers really fluctuating around that, just going over and just going under that 10 cumulative cases in Albemarle County each week when they measure it on Saturdays. And so as you recall, what the CDC and the Virginia Department of Health recommend is that we use two figures or two sets of facts, the level of impact on a school, which we are considering low at this point because of the  The very low number of cases that we are seeing that aren't affecting student absenteeism or staff capacity. And the moderate level of transmission puts us into the lowest level of school impact.  We are hoping that this is the second board meeting in a row that we've been able to come to you with the figures that show us in that lowest level of impact. We are keeping our fingers crossed and cautiously optimistic that we will be able to continue to report that our impact remains low throughout the division. And so that is our update for tonight.

    "text": "Thank you. My name is Jackson Zimmerman. I'm your school finance officer, and I'm here to present for your consideration the third quarter financial reports. One of the important things, a number of important things to consider with this report,  In this particular section of report, we do have March 31st ADM, which is the count of students across the fiscal year that we've enrolled in Albemarle County Schools. And it is 1,033 less than was originally budgeted. Another very important consideration during this financial report is that that has not affected state revenues as it would normally have affected state revenues.  there is a hold harmless provision in state funding, in addition to extremely strong state revenues that were not initially projected when our budget was adopted in the midst of the pandemic last year. So if we take a look at our financials in terms of revenues, our revenues are strong this year, primarily due to a conservative estimate in state revenues, and then also hold harmless funding that was passed by the General Assembly  Uh, just this past winter on terms of, of expenses, we do expect our expenses to be less than what was originally budgeted. Um, that's not, uh, unusual during this time period, uh, that there are slightly less than originally anticipated. So we will end up with, um, a fund balance at the end of this fiscal year.  And then I will move on to the final discussion regarding fund balance. At the start of this fiscal year, we had about a $9.5 million initial starting fund balance. We budgeted the use of just over a million dollars in that fund balance when we first started the year. We have some lapse savings. We have additional revenues coming in from the state.  We have some operational savings that are budgeted. We did use $2.6 million for a one-time payment made to staff in April that was approved by the board. And that has taken place. We did transfer during the month of April $4 million of our fund balance to CIP to cover projects that are associated with that.  And then we did use $5 million worth of fund balance in the adoption of the budget for FY 22. We do anticipate at the end of this year, we will finish the year with approximately $3 million, a little bit less than $3 million in available fund balance at the start of next fiscal year, end of the current fiscal year. So just wanted to report to the board that we are in a strong financial position.  We are following under the 2% requirement for fund balance by the Board of Supervisors. And I'd be happy to field any questions that you may have.",

I'm sure it was an oversight. I know for certain it was not some sort of conspiratorial secrecy attempt. But we need to own the fact that, yeah, if we're going to do that, if you're going to put up the sixth and seventh grade curriculum and say the eighth grade curriculum is going to be put up, it needs to get put up. Because it does have an appearance of,  impropriety, even though I don't believe for a minute that it is improper. I welcome the conversations. I quite frankly am very proud of what Henley did. I think there are things that can be improved, but that's why we have pilots. That's why we do this, so that we can learn.

And then, you know, it's really just a form of differentiation. So that's our policy for all programming.

    "text": " I will say that we, through the communications office, we really have scrutinized Dr. Costa's rollout of what she did with the pilot. And while I would say that I can only think of a handful of times over the time that I've worked in this school system where there's been absolutely flawless rollout of anything, that Dr. Costa and her team at the school really did  do what we ask our principals to do and what we ask our teachers to do in communicating to families around programming. So while we can always improve, we can always get better at what we do, I want to be sure and make sure that, again, I always take responsibility. If there's a flaw in how something's rolled out,  or if people felt left out of the process, then that's not Dr. Costa's responsibility. She used all the tools at hand. She followed the policies that we have. And so I want to be sure that I say that. Having said that, we can always do better. And there's always a way to try to reach families another way. And we're going to continue to try to do that.",

    "text": " And just, and we'll be happy to provide that what I would say is that as, as you know, as a school board, you went through several sessions of working with your way through Glenn Singleton's book courageous conversations about race and engaged in conversations on that topic and I'm, you know, I'm just going to say that I'm.  I'm proud to be part of a school board to work for you for a board that would engage in that kind of work and a lot of boards around the state and nation run away from this kind of work and so you've rolled up your sleeves and engaged in it. That is very similar to what our teachers and administrators have been doing in the schools throughout the school year.  some schools to a greater extent than others, but what you experienced in many cases is what has been experienced in terms of training with our educators. And I'm also proud to be part of a system that is enacting a policy that we approve. As some board members pointed out, students worked on that policy, they went around and  shared that policy at different groups, such as parent council, student council, all various advisory groups. We had a seat team meeting last week that was publicly advertised for quite some time that any member of our Albemarle County Schools community could attend that talked specifically about the topics that that were brought up tonight. And we had nine people in attendance at that meeting.  So there are many, many opportunities to engage our administration, to engage our teachers, to engage with our students around this work. So we're going to keep providing them, and I hope that attendance at these opportunities that are already on the table without creating new ones, the ones that are already planned to share our work, to get feedback on it, are there for people to partake.",

    "text": " Thank you, Dr. Haas. Do we have any other school board business? Any other school board members with additional business? If not, remember our retreat is tomorrow beginning at nine o'clock.  And also, I'd like to thank because this is the last night that Layla will be our student rep. She had to leave early, I think, but we do appreciate her serving on the board and also Maya tonight. Tonight would also be Maya's last time. So we'll end up with new student reps beginning in July. So if there is no other business,  Our meeting for tonight is adjourned and thanks. Good night, everybody. Bye, guys.",
