When a young lady from Albemarle High School realized what was happening in communities around her, she organized Students Working Against Hunger, also known as SWAG, to reduce food insecurity in those homes.  In the intervening months, this club has gone from about a dozen students to more than 50. So our community hero, Kat Ravichandran, established the wish program in which she and her peers convinced, established a wish program, I'm assuming that's supposed to be a swag program, in which she and her peers convinced local restaurants to donate leftover food for those in need. She led a food drive for the Haven and organized a fundraiser for the Monacan Indian Nation.  I also believe she is going to be one of our alternate student reps, which is amazing. The week after next, on April 12th, Cat will assume the responsibility for one of the food bank's most important community outreach programs, its annual school fund drive. The drive is the food bank's single largest community outreach program, usually generating enough supplies for 54,000 meals. I know that Agne Herd is participating, and after spring break, we're supposed to bring food to it. So hopefully other board members can bring food as well.  To give you an idea of the need, the food bank serves 23,000 people, so the school food drive, the largest community outreach program, provides a little over two meals per person. I'd like to ask Kat to tell us how she became involved in this essential community service, what she has learned about our community this past year, and how we can support our SWAG students during the month of April. And Kat, by the way, already has agreed to lead the school food drive in 2022.",

    "text": " Hi, thank you so much. So, um, in winter of 2020 we had a guest speaker come in to our school and they told us that one in six people in the Albemarle Charlottesville area struggle with hunger. And I think anybody who hears that number would want to help. And when I found out that there wasn't a specific club at Albemarle that was specializing in combating food insecurity.  I connected with some of my friends, and we founded the Students Working Against Hunger Swag Club. And it started with just a dozen members, but now it's grown into an official nonprofit with over 50 members. And some of the things that we've learned through that have been, well, first of all, the magnitude of the issue, which has only been exacerbated during the pandemic. And that one in six number is now burgeoning on one in five people in our community.  And, but I think the second thing that we've learned is that even though this pandemic is worsening the issue, it doesn't mean that we can't still find ways to help, even albeit not the orthodox methods. Just because we can't go and volunteer in a warehouse or go and volunteer at a food distribution site doesn't mean that we can't still put on socially distanced events, socially distanced fundraisers, still connect restaurants that produce excess food with local pantries. And I think we've learned that as long as you're passionate about a cause, we can still find ways in our community  to support them. And then I think another thing that we've learned that sort of goes hand in hand with that is that no matter how isolated this pandemic has made us that we've that we're still, we're still more connected in the sense of like a community passion for just improving the community with all these areas of improvement that we can see.  And that sort of leads me into why I'm here today which talk about the school food drive for the blue Jerry food bank. So, which is going to be taking place from April 12 to April 30. And so while the blue Jerry food bank sees heightened donations in the holiday season.  By the time the spring gets around, their donation yields severely decrease. But just because those donation yields are decreasing doesn't mean that they're not serving over 100,000 consumers, clients, every single month. And so the School Food Drive, which is the largest community outreach program that they put on all year, offers the chance to fill that donation yield gap.  whole, and I think it also offers an opportunity as a community to come together and support it. So I urge, we currently have around a dozen schools in the county signed up, and I urge all the schools participating, families, students, teachers, to really participate and show that we can have a positive impact on our community. And schools who aren't participating, to contact fooddrive at brafb.org,  and email them and so we can get as many schools in the county participating and we can really all come together and work to help our community. Thank you.",

    "text": " Thank you, Chair Page. We just observed National Women's History Month here in the United States. One of its purposes was to join in commemorating and encouraging the study, observance, and celebration of the vital role women play in American history. Earlier this week, we received an advanced look at just who we will be celebrating in future years, and four of these extraordinary young women, I'm proud to say, are our students.  The annual Emily Couric Leadership Forum Scholarship Awards were announced this week, and in the words of the forum, their awards are designed to encourage all women to adopt an active role in government, public issues, and policy debates affecting their communities, and to inspire young women to pursue activities that will empower them to become effective leaders.  For the second consecutive year, the top award, the Emily Couric Leadership Scholarship, was earned by an Albemarle High School student, and this year she's Aditi Prakash. Aditi plans a career in education policy, especially to help bring the love of science to disadvantaged students. She will receive $35,000 toward her college education at Stanford University.  The recipient of the forum's Joshua J. Scott Merit Award and a $15,000 scholarship is Rachel Field from Monticello High School. Of course, we all remember Rachel's medical research project from her appearance before us last month. Two other students received $7,000 scholarships from the forum, Mia Shiner from our charter school and Kimball Sheehan from Western Albemarle High School.  Aditi and Rachel were able to join us this evening and under normal circumstances, I would ask them to join us at the podium so that we could shake their hands. In this virtual world, however, I wonder if we could all applaud and give a thumbs up to these extraordinary young women and tell them that we all are looking forward to reading about their impressive accomplishments in future years.",

Whereas over the past year, the school division has transferred a transition from stage one with all students virtual to stage four with more than 8,000 students in schools, while maintaining a learning environment described by the health department as one of the safest locations in the greater community for students during the pandemic.  Whereas more than 180 building services professionals have been at the forefront of the program to keep schools and offices safe by improving heating and air conditioning systems, installing air purifiers in all classrooms and isolation rooms, obtaining adequate personal protective equipment for employees without undue delay.  retrofitting 900 classrooms to meet physical distancing guidelines, and whereas the building services team purchased and installed over 1,000 desks as part of this process while moving all previous furniture in these classrooms to newly leased storage space,  Without disruption to school operations or the safety of students and staff and whereas building services professionals created new learning environments in common areas.  and continued to faithfully implement the COVID-19 cleaning and disinfectant protocols that made it possible to safely more than triple the number of students able to resume in-person instruction. And whereas the team made possible the timely delivery of health and wellness equipment,  and procedures used by every school to screen students, staff, visitors. And whereas this year, the team took on a new assignment by undergoing training in the painting of schools, applying more than 775 gallons of paint without disturbing school operations.  And whereas since this work previously was completed by outside vendors and had been postponed by the pandemic last summer, the team saved the school division more than $200,000. And whereas a thankful school administrator  has requested an opportunity to have students and staff be able to formally express their appreciation for the dedication and excellence that the building services team has devoted to their health, well-being, and success throughout the pandemic.  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the school board wholeheartedly supports that request and calls upon all schools to express their appreciation to their building services partners. And furthermore, hereby proclaims the week of April 12th through 16th, Building Services Appreciation Week in the Albemarle County School Division.",

The school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governments and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment, despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. And for this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comments.  First, as always, written comments can be submitted to the school board clerk and will be given to all the school board members for review. And second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before electronic public comment commences, I'm going to announce the order in which the speakers will comment. We have 17 speakers today, so I'll announce them three at a time so you know when you're up.  And then when it's that speaker's turn to provide comment, you will have two minutes to speak. It's been lowered to two minutes. It's not the three minutes that it normally is. I will give you an indication when there's one minute left. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial districts and speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division.  Lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. So with that bread, I will go ahead and announce the first three speakers. We have Mason Rothenberger, Kaitlin Boyd, and Rashimi Guy. Mason, you are on. Sometimes that takes me a while to see. Yep, I see.",

I would like to speak to the school board tonight about the 4x4 schedule for next year. I, as a student, would like to let you know that the 4x4, while it was intended to reduce student stress, did not do that. I specifically, and I know that this does not apply to all students, I'm taking quite a few AP classes, and it is really difficult  to have classes that you have taken in the first semester that you need to review in the second semester and then also be learning additional content in the second semester. It puts a lot of pressure on students because it's not like you're taking three AP classes over the entire school year. It's like you took two in the first semester and then you're taking three in the second semester. I would really, really plead you to go to a seven period or eight period schedule  because that's going to help students learn a lot better. Interleaving classes every other day has been shown to drastically improve how students retain information from all of those classes. And students who return to classes, the same classes day after day after day, they're getting really tired of those classes. And it's really easy to get overwhelmed and get behind and stress yourself out over that. So I understand why the decision was made.  It has not worked out that way. Students are more stressed. And I can tell you from a Western perspective, students are not going to stop taking APs. So they're going to continue to have these stresses going forward. And that is really detrimental to our mental health. Thank you. I don't think I've used my two minutes, but thank you.",

I'll start off by saying that I am so thankful to be back in person two days a week and I cannot wait to be back in person five days a week hopefully soon. I'm speaking tonight to explain why I hope we get rid of the four by four schedule for next school year. The four by four is incredibly hard to manage and inconvenient for students. Teachers have only half the amount of time to get through the same amount of coursework.  Although we have class four times a week instead of two, this extra class time doesn't help with homework and longer assignments like projects. A four-by-four schedule means that all assignments have to be completed in half the time they would be in a normal year-long schedule. Because everything is virtual, assignments are often due at midnight the very same day they're assigned, which is very stressful for students participating in extracurriculars. It's easy for students to fall behind and hard for them to get back on track. Another problem with a four-by-four is that because classes are divided into semesters,  Student schedules can be very lopsided and end up with their easier classes in one semester and their hard classes in the other semester. Although the 4x4 isn't ideal for anyone, it is especially hard for students taking AP classes. Exams are still being given in May and early June, which means that students who choose to take exams for their first semester AP classes will be taking a test in May or even June for class that are in from September through January.  As well as many of my classmates, I am currently having to manage studying for AP exams for classes I haven't taken since January while still completing all the work for my current classes. I understand that a four-by-four schedule makes it easier to focus as students only have to keep track of four classes at a time instead of eight. However, it has done a lot more harm than good in the past year, particularly to students' stress levels. I'm concerned that ACPS is leaning towards keeping the four-by-four schedule for next year because it's the easiest option.  I'm sure that it is, especially if you're planning on offering optional virtual instruction next year. But the easiest way out is never what is best for students, and ACPS did not become a good school district by choosing the easy option. Thank you all for the opportunity to speak tonight, and I truly hope we'll be back in a year-long class schedule in August.",

    "text": " Hi, thank you for allowing me to speak this evening. I am in the Whitehall District and my daughter is a second grader at Crozet Elementary. I have concerns about the proposed school calendar for the 2021-22 school year. It appears that there are monthly half-day planning days included in the calendar. With this calendar, there will be very few weeks during the school year that students will be going to school  for an entire week uninterrupted. Our children have lost so much instructional time last year and this year, and I do not believe asynchronous learning is equivalent to instructional time. I view asynchronous assignments as homework with a caregiver who is often not a certified teacher having to manage and assist with these assignments, especially for the younger grades. Further, half days put a huge burden on working parents,  who have to find childcare for the second half of the day. Many programs, including E-DEP, operate only on full days for teacher workdays. I know teachers have expressed concern about the lack of planning time and agree they should have adequate time, perhaps using existing teacher workdays and moving all professional development to the summer before school starts, or adding a couple of full-day teacher workdays to the calendar dedicated to planning, with the lost instructional time made up.  I would also like to express support for schools to be in person Monday through Friday for the full day starting the first day of school for all students in K-12 who wish to return. Our children's mental health and loss of learning outweighs the risks at this time for many families.  With teachers prioritized to be vaccinated, there shouldn't be a reason for school not to be in person five days a week with safety precautions in place. The CDC and Dr. Fauci said that three feet of distancing with masking may be acceptable. Also, Moderna and Pfizer are now conducting vaccine clinical trials for children under the age of 12. With the uncertainty surrounding how ACPS will start,  I know several parents who are pulling their kids out of public school and securing spots in private school, which will ultimately affect our school funding. Please plan to fully reopen our schools in the fall of 2021. Thank you. Thank you for those comments, Ms.",

    "text": "Hi, thank you. My name is Adam Cohen. I live in the Samuel Miller district, and our family has three kids in the ACPS system. I'm here to respectfully ask the board to prioritize a move to stage five before the end of this year  and a commitment to return to five-day full-time in-person learning for all grade levels in the fall. The ACPS website states that, together, the school board and superintendent take primary responsibility for ensuring that ACPS is an effective school system. An effective school system, among other things, assures that its focus is on both quality and equity. Quality and equity speak to any student  Teacher or parent locally, and the majority will tell you, we've already heard tonight, without question that virtual learning is not of the same quality as in-person, despite the best efforts of teachers and staff, which are absolutely appreciated. Our kids are resilient, but online and asynchronous work deprives students of the personal connections with teachers and classmates that are so important and drive true learning gains. Our children and many of their peers are incredibly happy to be back in school even two days a week.  They show much more engagement and enthusiasm for their classwork, and they report that learning in person is far superior to learning virtually. They would do anything to be back in school full-time. It's also hard to see how hybrid schedules are equitable to all students. Some are able to manage with a parent who stays home, but for many working parents, a two-day on, three-day off schedule is not feasible.  Without a consistent in-person option, families are forced to make hard choices or accept educational, emotional, and economic losses. I urge you not to write off the remainder of this year as a lost cause and to commit to return to five full days for all students by next fall. With teachers vaccinated and updated guidance reducing recommended spacing below six feet, there's still plenty of time to get kids back in school and begin to close the gap before next year.  We're depending on you to stop the negative compounding effects of remote learning and get our kids back on track. Thank you.",

    "text": "Hi, Alexandra Redhorn, and I have a student at Burley and a student at Monticello High School.  First, I'd like to thank the school board members and the superintendent for offering this opportunity to speak. I would also like to extend my deepest appreciation to them and to all the administrators and teachers who made this school year possible. I was completely in favor of online learning for the school year, and I equally supported the hybrid when it became feasible. I am now adding my voice to those who are in favor of returning fully in person next year. My reason for addressing the board this evening is the four by four schedule that is rumored to be implemented in high schools in 21-22.  It is troubling to me that some guidance counselors in the county are already presenting this to parents as a done deal with no discussion by this body. Some are just asking for input, but others have openly announced it as decided. As the parent of a student who took AP classes this year and who is slated to take several more next year, I am totally disheartened by this plan. And I hope I can be reassured by this body that it will not be taken up without discussion, particularly since it was previously in place several years ago and was discarded because it did not successfully serve students.  As far as I can tell, the four-by-four was implemented this year because of the need to teach virtually. To that end, I am not objecting to it retroactively, but it is clear that this decision was driven by administrative and scheduling needs, not for pedagogical reasons. I have spent the last two weeks talking to parents, students, and teachers about what is to be gained by continuing a four-by-four in an in-person environment, and I have yet to hear a reason that supports better learning outcomes. I have heard it is easier to schedule, easier for online, and good for those who want to graduate early.  I profoundly reject all those arguments. I also am prepared to counter those who say it is similar to college, because it is not. College classes don't meet every day, and you don't take an evaluative exam like the AP six months later. There are more counter arguments to offer, but not in the limited time I have today, and your students already did it for me. Bottom line, we aren't here to do easy and quick. We are here to do well. Those of us engaged in education are charged with providing the best we can, regardless of expediency.  I urge the board to carefully consider the opinions of teachers and students who have already been pressed to the limit when they discuss continuing the four-by-four schedule. Thank you for your time.",

Here's a portion of an open letter petition composed by the ACPS Families for Safe Open Schools group. After just one week, the petition has 863 signatures from parents and community members across the county. Dear Dr. Haas and school board members, we are writing in support of a full-time, five-day, fully in-person instructional option for all ACPS students, no later than fall 2021, in addition to a high-quality virtual option.  with educators dedicated to a single model of instruction, either in person or virtual. We make this request in full recognition of all that has been done to date. We acknowledge and appreciate the incredible efforts of teachers, staff, the administration, and the school board to accommodate ever-changing circumstances this school year. However, it is now time to plan for the next school year, and the goal must evolve. With the availability of vaccines, more data on transmission,  and the importance of in-person learning for student mental health, the benefits of full-time in-person school now outweigh the risks. We support looking at best practices from nearby school systems, getting more detailed feedback from all stakeholders, taking advantage of increased funds for capital improvements and staffing needs, and working in collaboration to make this goal a reality. Speaking on my own behalf, as I understand the law that Governor Northam just signed yesterday,  Virginia State Law SB 1303. The law requires each school board to offer in-person instruction to each student enrolled in the local school division for at least the minimum number of required instructional time, which is 180 days or 990 hours each school year. This law does not mean a hybrid option of 8 to noon for some and 1 to 4 p.m. for others with virtual or async at home as the other half of learning.  It does mean a full-time, five-day, fully in-person instructional option. The law also requires a high-quality virtual option. We are asking for what the state wants for our students as well.

I think we need to be back in schools by, as many have said before me, five days a week in person, seven hours a day.  By fall, at the maximum in person learning is has been shown to be much better than online learning, and it's not just a great difference it's just the knowledge that we can retain.  going, you know, learning with a person, having personal connections with teachers. If we're online for another year, I think people like juniors and seniors are going to be struggling to figure out who they can ask to write college recommendations. So that's the biggest reason why I think we need to have in-person teachers again. I think I'll just send it there. Thanks.",

    "text": " Hi. I have two students at Western. I have a freshman and a junior. I'm going to reiterate a few points that some other people made about the four-by-four schedule. And I have a lot to get through, so I'm going to try to hit them like bullet points. But thank you for having me. The four-by-four schedule has the following negative impacts on the student experience. It interrupts the flow of coursework that builds on one another. Foreign language coursework and math coursework can be interrupted by a full calendar year.  depending on which semester the students assign the courses. It prevents integral cross-curricular courses from having their full impact, such as global studies where English and history curriculums have been designed to support and enrich one another. Many students are having these courses sequentially in the 4x4 schedule instead of concurrently.  It harms the development of the student-teacher relationship. It often takes a few months for teachers and students to fall into a rhythm and routine with one another where relationships can form. In the 4x4 schedule, the relationship is just starting to deepen when the course winds down and a new semester with new teachers begins. These important relationships are never fostered, which enriches students' experience in school.  There's no way to consistently schedule a balanced group of classes each semester for students. Students have the potential to be academically overloaded one semester and have a lighter load or primarily electives the other. For seniors, this will impact the coursework and grades they submit on their college applications in the first semester.  The entire AP testing experience is hamstrung. We've heard a little bit about that from the students. And if you think about it for rising seniors, this will be three years of inadequate opportunities for appropriate AP testing because last spring they were messed up. This year they're getting screwed up by AP classes in the fall trying to test in the spring.  et cetera, and that same thing could happen next year. The arts are taking a huge hit. Band, which should be a year-long class, was limited to one semester this year. It precluded many lifelong band members from participating and removed an integral part of the high school experience for band members. While high school sports continued, band was marginalized, thus marginalizing a huge group of students whom band is the highlight of their non-academic experience.  And by cutting band, they have to either choose marching band in the fall or orchestra in the spring. And one last thing, the kids at Center One, if you go to four by four schedule, they have to miss an entire semester at their home-based school. So you're basically taking a group of kids and isolating them from their high school for a whole semester. Thanks.",

    "text": " Hi, my name is Sarah Dressheim. I live in the Scottsville district and have two children in Elmirale schools, a fourth grader at Stone Robinson and a sixth grader at Burleigh. Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight. My daughter Claire has a wonderful fourth grade teacher and really a team of fourth grade teachers at Stone Robinson who are doing an amazing job. But the experience she's having with only two days a week of education is completely inadequate given what I know is usually taught in fourth grade.  Even though she's very bright, my husband and I are very involved parents, and we pay for a sitter to help oversee her asynchronous learning time, she is still well behind what she should be learning in full-time fourth grade education. Fourth and fifth graders are getting left behind in the current model. They are the only students in the county not getting four days of synchronous learning. They're being set up for incredibly difficult years of catching up in middle school.  All elementary school age kids need to be back in at least four days a week schedule as soon as possible. The evidence shows that outbreaks are not happening in schools. We are seeing news article after news article that children, especially K through 12 are suffering a mental health crisis. And a big part of this is the inability to be in school. The teachers have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated. They've been deemed essential workers and the vaccines have been proven to be effective.  Our children can wear masks and the CDC has dropped its guidance to three feet, allowing many more children to be in the buildings. I'm urging you as the school board to move forward now with first and foremost getting fourth and fifth graders the same opportunity that every other student in the school system is getting and allowing them to have access to their teachers four days a week with in-person instruction.  It's also time to commit to five days a week, full day in-person instruction in the fall. Parents and students deserve this commitment now so we can plan for what we'll choose to do for our children in the next school year. The teachers, our superintendent and the administration also deserve that commitment so they can determine the needs of the school system. Teachers should not be asked to provide both virtual and in-person instruction at the same time. The biggest counties in Virginia, including Alexandria and Fairfax have already stated they're committed to this. If they can commit now, so can we.  You owe it to us, to your constituents to commit and give us what we deserve in public school education. Thank you for the time. Thank you, Ms.",

As we all know, that is not going to happen. But we also need to talk about the relationships that everybody is losing out on. When we think about our former lives and our past lives and what we did when we were younger, it's those relationships that we forged when we were in school, our relationships with our teachers,  the role models that we got, what we learned from our peers, both younger, older, the same age group. So school is so much more than academics and you cannot get that in a Zoom environment. You're not gonna get that at all. And having the kids interactive, not only learning from one another, but dealing with the awkwardness of some of the social interactions, understanding because our whole lives we're gonna interact with people. So if we're only looking at the academics, we're not realizing how much more powerful  and wonderful school can be with our emotional well-being, our mental well-being. My daughter, who's an eighth grader, I asked her, are you happy to be at school? She's doing two days a week. And she was like, yes, mom, yes. And I'm like, what is making you so happy about it? She's like, I have friends, mom.  I mean, what a concept. She has friends. Like you can't have friends when you're in Zoom. And I said, anything else? She said, I'm learning, mom. She said, I just am not learning when I'm on Zoom all day. I space out. It's not the same. So yes, I advocate for what other people are saying. Five days a week, it's for all our age groups. It's not elementary, middle, high. It's everybody. All of our children deserve that. Other schools are doing it. I know we can too. Thank you.",

Augusta, Chesapeake, Chesterfield, Fauquier, if I'm saying that right, Green, Hanover, Henrico, Powhatan, Prince George, Roanoke,  These are 10 Virginia counties that are currently offering five, or in some cases four for secondary, in-person days a week to their students, several since the beginning of the year, and a few will be starting in the upcoming weeks. It is not an exhaustive list either. These are simply the counties I personally know about who have made it work. This tells me that it can be done, and there's no reason that we shouldn't be committing and planning for five days a week for all students, at least by next year, school year.  The data has overwhelmingly shown schools are safe for both teachers and students, even without vaccination. The data has shown there is very real damage being done right now to our children emotionally, socially, and academically, damage that unfortunately will have lasting and potentially lifelong effects. It is clear the lowest risk option is to bring children back into school full-time next school year. I'm amazed, and not in a good way, that after all the published school studies, medical and government guidance, academic testing data,  and parent student testimony this past year that parents like me are having to sign petitions to insist the ACPS administration and school board give their children education they deserve. Other counties in the state have already committed to a full-time five-day start next school year. Why hasn't ACPS made that same pledge to put the needs of their students first above all else? Why are we waiting to make that commitment when it is the right  The right thing, the best thing, and the safest thing to do. Thank you.",

I am here to advocate too that our children return to five days a week in-person school no later than this fall. As of Tuesday, it was announced that everyone aged 16 and older will be eligible for the vaccine by April 16th. By this fall, all teachers, staff, and persons should have either received the vaccine or personally chosen not to receive it. If they chose not to vaccinate, that's their own personal choice based on their own assessment of the risks and benefits of coronavirus disease versus side effects of the vaccine.  At that point, no further accommodation should be made as for the vaccine for our children, which may or may not be available this fall. However, our children are either asymptomatic or have mild illness. Per Yale, Boston Children's, and John Hopkins websites, the feared post-COVID illness of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, is rare, and of those, most recover quickly.  My friend and colleague, Dr. Peter Dean is a pediatric cardiologist at UVA and a parent of children in this district says kids don't get sick from COVID. There is no way that should be a reason to keep them out of school. Even kids with MISC universally have return of normal function.  Importantly, today UVA announced its plans to return to in-person instruction and normal operation as its default mode this fall. My family and I choose to live here in Albemarle County, and one of the driving factors is the public school system. However, if we do not return to five days in person in the fall, we will look at relocating outside of the county. Thanks for letting me speak.",

I'm speaking tonight in support  of plans that Superintendent Haas spoke of during the county budget meeting on March 15 to expand the extended day enrichment program to include pre-K students once again. This expansion, along with other plans to bring more equity to the program, will allow families to utilize it for their preschool students and to move forward in recovering from this pandemic year.  Impacts congregations heard many stories during our listening process this fall of families struggling to access affordable preschool and childcare. Preschool is an important step toward closing the achievement gap in our schools. For working parents having after school care available at the end of their preschoolers day is essential to be able to use the county's preschool program.  Ms. Mr. Page, Ms. Colson, and Dr. Acuff all publicly stated their support of this pilot expansion of EDEP to the over 1,200 community members present at our Nehemiah Action last week. And I want to thank them for that on behalf of IMPACT. I sincerely hope that the rest of the board will also support this. Thank you for your time.",

I'm speaking today about my plans to complete my Eagle project on my way to achieving the Eagle Scout rank. My project is to build a gaga pit for Stone Robinson as a part of their new fitness playground that they just had installed.  The game of gaga ball is simple, fun, and safe, and I've played it many times with my friends. Building the gaga ball pit will provide a fun new game for students at Stone Robinson, as well as the soccer kids who use the soccer fields for practice and games after school. I've met with a representative from Stone Robinson who is very excited about the project, and she has helped me to pick out a great location for me to build the pit.  I have a materials list and a donation sign up that I will use to gather materials for my project. And I have a troop full of scouts ready to help me build it. And I'm very excited to get started. Thank you.",

    "text": " Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to speak and also to your service to our community. My name is Hunter Stokes of the Samuel Miller District and my wife and I have three children attending Albemarle County Public Schools. I implore you on behalf of my family and many other like-minded families to take a cue from other school districts across the country and commit to full-time in-person learning in the fall. Meaningful relationships, academic progress, and a strong sense of community are not attainable in a virtual environment.  Yet, the core purpose of ACPS, as stated on its very own website, is to establish a community of learners and learning through relationships, relevance, and rigor, one student at a time. Your actions, or lack thereof, are growing increasingly difficult to reconcile with your mission statement.  I'm deeply concerned for our children's mental health and academic development, they are falling behind their peers in the local private schools and other public school districts where decision makers have the guts to deal with the fallout from a very small but vocal group that would be satisfied if our children stayed at home forever.  Despite the degree to which equity is cited in almost every decision made, isn't it obvious that the children in disadvantaged households, the ones without a parent at home to assist with virtual learning, the ones without the financial resources to augment the curriculum with private tutoring, the ones without even the most basic needs, such as reliable internet service, are the children that suffer the most? The longer status quo persists, the further the gap widens.  Our kids deserve better. Parents deserve better. ACPS should commit now to full-time in-person learning in the fall, supported by a thoughtful, considerate plan that provides a safe environment for all stakeholders. My family moved to Albemarle County for the schools. It would be a tragedy if we moved elsewhere because of them. Thank you in advance for your consideration.",

    "text": " Thanks, Eileen. And as you recall, also the CDC has given us a couple of other ways to look at this in terms of our core indicators. One is that they have a core indicator of the total cumulative cases in Albemarle County over the past seven days.  and that they update this data now once a week, and the data is from the previous Saturday each week. So as of March 27th, our cumulative caseload in the county was 91.98, which is in the substantial range, and our percent positivity for the past seven days was 1.4, which was in the lowest range. When these two numbers aren't in the same range, the CDC recommends following the guidance  for the higher of the two ranges. As you can see, we have come down for the past three weeks from the high range into the substantial range and appear to be holding pretty steady at that lower level.  If you remember also that we take the level of community transmission and couple that with the level of school impact, which we are rating at low, we have zero or sporadic cases. We have sporadic cases of COVID in our schools with no evidence of in-school transmission. Our student absenteeism is at a low level and staff capacity is normal. And they also ask us to take a look  at a chart that puts these two things together. So when we have our community transmission rate at the orange level, which is substantial, and a low impact to schools, that puts us in this top right quadrant in terms of where we should be with our schools. And in the main  take away from that is that we should be open for in-person instruction to the maximum extent possible, ensuring three to six feet of distance for our students and a minimum of six feet of distance for our middle and high school students. And so that we've been at that level for the past couple of times that we've talked with the board and Eileen and I would be happy to take any questions or comments from the board at this time.",

    "text": " Yes, thank you again Chairman Page, Pat McLaughlin, Chief of Strategic Planning for the School Division, and I'm here now to give you an update on the School Division calendar for the 2021-2022 school year. As you recall, at the meeting we had on March 11, staff brought forward a revised 21-22 school year calendar  that sought to create dedicated time for professional learning community meetings next year. One of the silver linings that's been identified during the pandemic was the enhanced ability for PLC meetings, both for our school-based PLC teams and for cross-divisional PLCs to meet remotely.  To ensure that dedicated time, we proposed adding five half days to the school calendar next year. When coupled with existing professional development days that were already in the school calendar, that guaranteed one day per month of dedicated time for this work. Board feedback that night centered around the impact the additional half days would have on instructional time next year.  And based on that feedback, we present the board with two calendar options for next year. Draft A, which is included in your board packet, is the same draft that you saw on March 11th with the additional half days. Draft B in your board packet adds two additional instructional days to the calendar to account for the instructional time lost on the half days. In draft B, the school year would be 182 instructional days as opposed to 180 and would begin on Monday, August 23rd instead of Wednesday, August 25th.  So we're hoping tonight that the board will take action on one of these calendars, and I'm happy to take any questions that you may have that will help you with your decision making.",

So, and again, I guess, Chair O'Connor or Mr. O'Connor, Alcaro, what I, if we go back to the original adopted calendar, when you compare it to that, it would have one half day more of professional development than the original developed calendar.",

    "text": " And I just wanted to say something really quick. We're using the word professional development and there's a big distinguisher here. At the beginning of the school year, it's true, it is professional development in the sense that it's in abstract often from the presence of current data about student performance.  So what we look at when we do professional learning community time is that it's what we would call job embedded professional development, that the teachers are meeting in teams to look at their pacing, to look at their curriculum, and how things are going currently for the students that they have with them. And then they make real-time adjustments  to their pacing curriculum and intervention for their current students during that cycle. So there's a big distinguisher between professional development at the beginning or the end of the school year when you're not currently looking at your assessment data for those current students and being able to offer it on a regular basis during the school year.  These will not be professional development times where you bring in a speaker or you provide what we call sometimes spray and pray teaching and learning for educators. This is time where teachers are going to roll up their sleeves, work together, just like they are every Friday this year. So it makes a difference for their students in the current year.",

    "text": "Absolutely. So, and I'm so glad you brought that up because that's that is a conversation we're having right now, pending the board approval. So one thing I would say is that  It's scheduling them on Wednesdays is really it's not about it's it's it's about we know that on Mondays and Fridays that's when we have the most heavy leave usage by our employees that's people just tend to do that because they can you know they can just kind of line their ducks up in a row and.  be at work for four days and then, you know, that's just what people do. So it's not that we don't think they'll be attentive or maybe won't get down to business. It's just Wednesday is a good day to do it. It's midweek and you can also make some quick adjustments and turn things around by Friday. So what we will do is on these days, because we have become really good at teleconferencing, is start out with a division-wide conversation among  me and the elementary schools where we will kind of lay out the plan for the afternoon. We will talk about the work products that we want at the end of the session around data analysis, where their students are and what their plans are moving forward so that we can be impactful. And then we'll do the same thing with the secondary schools. We'll start out tight.  at the division level, and then they'll roll out into school meetings and then into grade level and subject area meetings. But there will be a product focus. They will be required to develop plans for students who need extra time and support, and also to make adjustments in their pacing and curriculum so that they can stay on track. So that's typically how the successful schools  that do professional learning community well have a product focus requirement, not just taking minutes about what they talked about that day, but what did they produce that's going to move students forward.",

    "text": " So I think that the success for this year, probably for one thing, is having that time, and it is on Fridays this year, the asynchronous Fridays, has allowed for our teachers to all meet together to develop common pacing on the grade levels. That was something that we didn't necessarily have before across the school system. You might have it within one team at a school or maybe  grade level in a school, but to have that so that what that does is it starts to build a guaranteed viable curriculum at the base of your, we call it a pyramid of interventions. So everybody's starting at the same place and providing the same instruction, and then they also develop common assessments. That has also been a byproduct of the work that's gone on this year is teachers using similar assessments to assess what we call power standards. I've heard  stories anecdotally from schools where they really knew that they didn't have as much instructional time as what they've had in the past. So they weeded out some of the extras that are not necessarily a top priority and boiled it down to power standards so that they could  test what they thought would be the most important things for students to learn. And then the success for that is the intervention that goes on to help students. And what we see is students improving in their performance on their reading and their math. And at the secondary level in particular, the conversations I just had a high school principal PLC for want of a better term, we only met one time to talk about on-time grad  graduation last week and the way they've structured that is around a professional learning committee where.  the principals are meeting with school counselors and looking one at a time at their students on their caseload, looking at where they are with their grades, reaching out to teachers and getting extra time and support and bringing those students in if they can come in to make up those grades. So you see that halfway through the year, we had a much higher rate of students that had failed classes and those students recovered those classes. And you're seeing the same thing now only happening in a more timely fashion because  the schools have adapted to the schedule. So what you'll see is ultimately we should see better performance across all of our enrollment groups when we have full school. I mean, I don't think it's necessarily fair to hold all the teachers to the same standard as we would if we had everybody coming in in person like we normally do. But we really should see enhanced performance across our  enrollment groups, that equity tables should start moving and gaps should be closed for our students. That really is the ultimate goal. High quality teaching and learning for all the students. Students that exceed the standards, they get enriched and they keep moving. The students that need extra time and support get it faster and don't have to be pulled out for long periods of time after they haven't been successful. So that's what you're looking for. Not a post-mortem each year, but  As the patient needs help, they get the help they need and we provide that support.",

But I guess what I would love to see, because I think I hear about the PLC model as one, it seems like a big part of high quality education for everyone, right?  And so I just would love to see metrics around that, the ways that we can, as a board, hold that accountable, that system accountable. So that's what I would like to see in the future.",

One of the things that we typically do at the beginning of the school year for teachers is we have two division level days to bring the teachers in and talk about the kinds of  work that we need them to do in their PLCs as they move forward. So we would put all that into one day and spread that, as Dr. McLaughlin said, throughout the school year. Many of the days at the beginning of the school year are professional development. They're also work days for teachers, getting their rooms ready and some of those pieces. So the principals would begin to accommodate that other day in the beginning of the school year by shortening some  some activities that they've done and again spread them to their professional development data.

We are currently working on every school will have an equity dashboard specific for that school.  so that we're starting to push down that accountability because lots of times we talk about things at the central office level and they are strong coming out, they kind of get to the school level and as they make their way in, they start to lose momentum. So one of the ways we can approach that is to bring the accountability to the school and start to look closely at that. But also it should be not just about, in my mind, accountability is not just about  negatives. We're also developing and working on a recognition system for the schools that are really making strides and making a difference in their results that they're getting. So Dr. Hairston and Dr. McLaughlin are currently working with a team of across level principals that are doing this work. And  I would just say anecdotally from the principals who have already on their own developed school level dashboards that it's a game changer when you have that first meeting with your staff and you show them where your school stands relative to the predictive value of race, class, gender, and other special capacities on student achievement. It starts to make a difference. It starts to make an impact.  We, the schools that have been successful in closing those gaps use the professional learning community model with fidelity. And that's why we want to, it's a bright spot that we want it to grow. And we're going to, this is going to be that broken record. We're just going to stay after it until we have complete fidelity across the school system and not take our foot off the gas. We've made too many assumptions about it for too long. And so this will help us get much greater fidelity and greater impact.",

The SEAC wanted, again, to thank the members of the school board, teachers, aides, and staff for their dedication to our children's educational needs during this unprecedented academic year, as we're all learning. The SEAC is pleased to have the opportunity to present our recommendation for the 2021-2022 academic school year.  Our first priority, as mentioned in our letter, is to increase the mental health support for students and families. The SEAC strongly encourages the school board to acknowledge this deficit and act swiftly. We recommend increasing the number of mental health support personnel in every school by an appropriate factor. Currently, all schools have at least one school counselor, but current staffing is not adequate to meet the increased needs we anticipate as students recover from the trauma and isolation imposed by COVID-19.  Some schools do not have a full-time psychologist available, and even those that do will likely find their caseload much too heavy for one psychologist. Additionally, we do expect that the school psychologist will have a workload that is at least equal to, if not dramatically increased, as before the pandemic. We recognize that there have been many additional duties beyond mental health support, which will require their time and effort.  and increases in mental health support for students should account for this. The current counselor to student ratio cannot even begin to cover the number of students who will need support upon returning to school. Both special education and general education students will need this additional support. Our number two item was something we're all very excited about this year and has continued to gain speed is continuing collaboration of  The SEAC with the contemporary schooling initiative portion of a graduate graduate and the Academy developments we're very excited about this, but we strongly encourage that that collaborative collaboration keeps growing. Due to the concern that our students will not fit into some of these new paradigms and learning centers proposed by the school board.  Again, we've only been recently invited to collaborate and we do thank you for this opportunity. We do wish to reiterate that the policies and procedures should be shared with all stakeholders and prior to making changes, often changes are made without this valuable input from stakeholders. This can lead to a vision within our community at a time when collaboration is valued over conflict. The third item we addressed was the recovery services for special education.  Recently, the county has sent out a survey for this particular focal point, so we support that initiative. And as the students return to school, we would like to see the reduction of any disproportionate suspensions for special education students, prioritize early learning, early literacy, and ensure the consistency and the applications of the multi-tier system of supports across the county.",

Stress and trauma are known causes of bullying. We supported this initiative last year, but I think it's sort of  that lost in the wayside of the pandemic. Given the added stress of the pandemic, it is likely that we will see an increased instances of bullying behavior now and during the return to in-person learning. It is more important now than ever that the Albemarle County Public Schools have a countywide program in place to address the causes and effects of bullying. We recommend using a proven program so that the implementation can be immediate. Safe Schools Ambassador Program, or SSA,  is an evidence-based model that works with students to teach them the skills to influence behavior and create positive changes. SSH trainers can conduct initial sessions and then train. The trainer courses are offered to keep the program active. Offering a turnkey program with a documented record of success will simplify the process of rapidly improving the anti-bullying culture in our schools.  We appreciate the time allowed tonight to present to the school board our 2021, our 2122 annual report. Thank you.",

    "text": "Yes, thank you. Again, I'm your executive director of Special Ed and Student Services.  And I would like to review for information your consideration, this go around my annual plan for twenty one, twenty two, which is required in order for Albemarle County Schools to secure over three million dollars in federal funding that flows through the Virginia Department of Ed. And just a quick breakdown and summary. Right. Our annual plan is essentially has two main parts, the first of which Albemarle County Public Schools assures the state and federal government that it will comply with all applicable laws.  And the second part is all accountability related they want to know the state wants to know how are we going to spend those federal dollars now. This is also there's three ways we spend the funding, two of the three are required right it's before we even get started it's we have to.  allocate monies to some mandates, the first of which is called coordinated early intervening services. And that is Albemarle County Schools is required to put 15% of that federal grant aside in order to make efforts to decrease the over identification of  students, particularly minority students, in special education or receiving special education services. That comes to approximately $470,000, which we're going to use this coming year to employ six full-time teachers that serve as intervention specialists within the division.  The second way we're going to spend a part of this funding is what's called our set-aside program. And set-aside is just that. We're required to set aside a portion of this funding for students that are eligible for special education services that are placed by their parents in private, parochial, independent, or homeschool programs that are located in Albemarle County.  So we have a calculation, an algorithm that has resulted in us figuring out we have to set aside just under $77,000. And those funds support an itinerant special education teacher that works with the parents and teachers of these eligible students.  part-time a few days a week. And in addition, some of that funding goes to support contracted speech services for about 20 students in this program. And then the third way we spend this federal funding is what's left, which is a little over $2.5 million. And what I'm doing this year, my proposal is to fund  approximately 73 special education instructional assistants. These instructional assistants work directly with students with disabilities. And that is my plan for your consideration and information that I'd hope you approve at a future date. Any questions?",

All of the schools, all the elementary schools, middle and high, they all get some form of support, particularly for response intervention and making gains in this effort.

    "text": "So, what I would say is that I'm super excited about the ambassador program because it really puts students in the driver's seat and promotes their leadership in the schools.  One of the things that the board is going to see when we roll out the strategic plan is when we look at our current state analysis from our survey data from students and other other pieces of data that are aggregate.  It really speaks to the fact that our students don't, to the degree that we would like them to, see themselves as in charge of their learning and being able to have agency at school. And I think that while it's certainly important to have the student ambassador program to combat bullying, it's also a great way to provide leadership opportunities to our youngest children all the way up. What we currently have in place in Alamo County Schools that we've had for a very, very long time now  And I would say it's, it is a very successful program is a responsive classroom. We've become so accustomed to responsive classroom that we don't even talk about it anymore. So when we talk about professional learning community. We want professional learning community to be like responsive classroom to where it becomes  Just the air that we breathe, the water we drink, it just is in what we do. All the circle time, the morning messages, all those things, they're based on a rock solid curriculum to build community in a school, empathy among students, and ultimately have had a very positive impact on bullying culture in our schools. Now, that's not to say that over time,  We couldn't find new ways to tackle bullying because it is one of those things that seems to find a way, no matter how you approach it, especially when a lot of it is adult-driven intervention. So I really want to see how things work with the ambassador program. Now that's at the elementary school level. At the middle school level, we use what's called the advisory period, which is based on developmental design  which is the middle school version of responsive classroom. And so it, that rolled out, I think more like maybe five or six years ago. And it grew just like responsive classroom. A couple of schools embraced it. They started book studies. There's actually a book called the advisory period that our teachers, many teachers have read and embraced. And so they do, they have circle time in the middle schools.  It's not called morning meeting and it is built around the same premises of building community, building empathy, encouraging leadership, encouraging all voices among all of our students. The final extension of the advisory period is freshmen seminar.  And also having an everyday intervention and enrichment period at our high schools. That has been a struggle since we instituted what is called the eight period day, which requires all of our students to take eight academic classes.  When we had a seven period day, we were able to build in a solid time every other day or every, every day depending on the school for students to meet work with a mentor, who was a teacher that they were assigned to.  And there wasn't as much structure around it. So we've got some work to do with that. So we do have a pre-K through 12 way of approaching this. But again, a lot of that is adult-driven. And I really am interested in seeing the evidence-based model that the Special Ed Advisory Committee has put before us. And I was disappointed that we couldn't follow through with it last year with the pandemic.  So we do have things in place, but we can always get better. And this is a great opportunity to do that.",

    "text": "Awesome. So I hope to oversee the implementation of the school name review process. And to kick us off this evening, I'm just going to share a few reminders and then turn it over to the schools.  So as a refresher on October 25, 2018, you all directed the superintendent to include the current school division values, excellence, young people, community, and respect to the criteria for naming school buildings and facilities. You also requested that the division review the names of all schools in the division that are named after individuals.  To date, you've approved the renaming of two schools, Mountain View Elementary and Lake Simon Middle School. Mountain View's name has already been in effect and Sutherland's new name and signage will go into effect this summer.  As a reminder, our intentions for the NeighborView process are grounded in three values, reflection, accessibility, and inclusion of all voices. We believe the NeighborView process allows an opportunity for school communities to reflect on the history of their school, their values, and aspirations. We also believe in the importance of ensuring there are multiple methods of soliciting feedback.  and we remain focused on uplifting and centering the perspectives of all members, especially our students. I'm confident that you will enjoy hearing this evening from Murray Elementary and the Charter Public School about the creative ways that they have engaged the members of their school communities. With that, I am going to turn it over to Murray Elementary. They will kick it off, we'll open it up for questions, and then we will conclude with the Charter School. Thank you.",

    "text": " Thank you, Ms. Fernandez. I am Allison Dwyer-Seldon. I am the principal at Murray Elementary School. Thank you for this opportunity to share about Virginia L. Murray Elementary School name review process. Virginia L. Murray Elementary School, generally referred to as Murray Elementary,  opened in 1960 as an all black elementary school. It integrated in 1965. The school was named for Virginia L. Murray, who was a supervisor of elementary education in our school division. She was the first black supervisor ever appointed in Albemarle County schools.  As a school that opened in 1960, Murray has a long history of serving many students from a variety of backgrounds, and the building's presence is somewhat of an anchor to the Morgantown Road community where the school is located. And here's a little bit about our advisory committee.  When we were informed that we would be engaging in the school name review process, we decided we wanted our committee to be highly inclusive in its composition to ensure we heard the perspectives of not only our current parent population, but also individuals from the Morgantown Road community as the school is a longstanding part of that area and has significance for the residents both past and present. We felt like we had a large stakeholder group we needed to engage.  A few components unique to our committee is that we had a parent, Ms. Teller Stolford, as our committee chair, differing from other committees whose chairs were often ACPS staff members. Thanks to her tenacious and thoughtful leadership, we created a committee of not only the required participants, ACPS staff, parents, and community members, but also reached out to find several school alumni to include a member who attended Murray Elementary the first year it was open.  Finally, we did want our students to have voice in this process as well as an opportunity to see firsthand what authentic engagement in a civic process looks like. Our student committee run by Murray teachers, Hollins Mills and Lar Richardson was composed of students in grades K through five. They met approximately 10 times during the time our committee worked. Like all school name review committee participants that have come before us, our committee members were all volunteer  receiving no compensation for the work and time that they gave, and we are very grateful for the large amount of time and energy they put into our process.",

    "text": " Thank you, Allison. And as Allison shared, it was such a meaningful process for our advisory committee to undergo. We followed the steps set out by the name review policy. And I'll just share with you tonight the most salient points of our discovery.  First and foremost, it was so much fun to see our youngest learners engage in this process. They were so active and worked so hard using project-based learning experiences to focus on student outreach and community engagement. After the first survey results came in, they shifted their focus over to thinking like historians.  learning about the history of both the school and its namesake Virginia Murray, and we hope that actually becomes part of the school curriculum going forward.  They plan to continue their work interviewing original Murray students like one of our committee's own Roosevelt Barber to make a digital archive. And they also plan to create a permanent installation in the school lobby to share with future students and families. I'm sorry, I hear my child calling me in the background.  In terms of public participation, we distributed two community-wide online surveys and we held two public comment meetings, both in February and March. Our first survey gave a brief bio of Virginia Murray and an overview of the school's history so that respondents could feel that they were making informed decisions responding.  We were very pleased with the participation to both surveys, particularly the first survey with over 450 respondents, which for such a small school was really exciting to us. As you can see, both surveys, the results are very clear. The vast majority in both choosing to retain the name.  And between the two public comment meetings, we had eight speakers in total share their thoughts with us. And we were really glad that we heard from at least one member of each stakeholder group. That was really important to us. And in fact, all speakers supported keeping our current name.  What is not included in this slide is that we also receive public feedback through a dedicated email address, as well as through neighborhood listservs, the majority of which supported keeping the name as is.  In following the school board policy, we also worked very hard to locate and invite a relative of Virginia Murray to our public meetings. This was a vital step for our committee because of the historic importance of the school in our community, particularly the black community. We found a grand nephew who preferred to remain anonymous.  And while he declined our invitation, he did state that education and community service have been important to their family for generations, with many of them being educators, reverends, and public servants. And we have a quote by another nephew, Michael Murray, on our website, who is quoted as saying, Ms. Murray was an outgoing and loving person who put the teaching of children  in the fundamentals of both learning and religion above everything else and dedicated her whole life to these ends. So it was clear to our committee that the Murray family was honored that the school was named for her and would like it would be meaningful to them for the name to stay.  So it is with great respect that we and the superintendent recommend that the name of Virginia L. Murray Elementary be retained. We believe this recommendation enjoys overwhelming support in the Murray school community and also that the name reflects the values set forth by our school district.  And I wish I had more minutes to share with you all the things that we learned about Virginia Murray through this process so i'll pick out just a few things about her as an educator and as a person to share with you as an educator.  Her standards for herself and her students were high, but attainable. Her instruction style was never generic, instead tailored to the individual. And in fact, it was her excellence in improving the quality of teacher and student education that earned her the naming honor originally.  She went above and beyond for her students, making sure they had food and clothes in the summer and heat and coats in the winter. And she herself was a lifelong learner receiving her master's degree at the age of 56 from NYU.  And as a person, she modeled tenacity and perseverance. In nominating her, her coworkers described her faithfulness, her unselfishness, her tremendous work ethic, and her devotion to duty. And her community contributions include church leadership positions and board positions with the American Red Cross, the community chest, which Allison tells me is a precursor to the United Way,  and also the Association for Supervisors and Curriculum Development, to name just a few. So thank you. And at this point, we would be happy to take any questions.",

I think it was news to many of them that the school opened in 1960 is an all black school.  That was incredibly meaningful to them and their process. They learned about the school history of black schools, predominantly in Albemarle County. They have already gotten to interview Roosevelt Barber, so they just peppered him with some amazing questions. I think they got so much out of this process. Learned so much, shared so much, each student took  what they were learning back to their homeroom and shared it with all the other students in the classroom. That was really meaningful for the students to get this tangible experience with the history. And they're so excited to continue.

My name is Chad Ratliff, and I serve as principal of the relatively recently merged community public charter school.  and Murray High School. To give you a brief history, Murray High School, initially called the Education Center, opened in 1988 as a school of choice and housed in Virginia L. Murray Elementary School. The following year, the program moved from V.L. Murray Elementary to our current location, the former Rose Hill Elementary School, which had just become available with the opening of Mountain View, then Cale Elementary. Our school kept the name Murray  but replaced the education center with high school by request of the approximately 20 students enrolled in the school at that time. Community public charter school, a middle school, opened about 20 years later and was originally housed inside Burleigh Middle School, relocating a few years later after that to our current location to be co-housed with Murray High. Of course, in February, 2020, your board approved the merger of the two schools into a new single  612 school entity that harkened back to the original philosophical concepts of both schools, which is a student centered learning pedagogical model and to serve as a lab school from which other schools can learn as it states in board policy and in state code. This merger initiated the naming process. I'm very honored to be here to share the work of our volunteer committee, which, as you know, became much more intensive and lengthy  than they were likely thought they were signing up for. But we are so thankful and delighted by their volunteer time and so appreciative of the thoughtfulness in which they put through this. Our committee composition included five staff members, myself included, teachers, and an office assistant, two members of the community who do not have children in schools, three students served on the committee  plus some additional feedback opportunities and special projects in addition to just the survey feedback model. And finally, five parents, including parents with children currently attending our schools and parents of students with children from all fear patterns that could possibly attend. One of our committee members also attended Rose Hill Elementary School when it was Rose Hill Elementary School.  And I am now going to turn the presentation over to Miss Shelly Blakey. As you may know, the wonderful Miss Stephanie Passman served as our committee chair. She's unavailable tonight. So I'm happy to introduce you to Miss Blakey, who will address you this evening in her absence and on behalf of the committee.",

We also had an amazing opportunity and really loved the process of taking the time to figure out what would be an appropriate name for this new merger of the school. So we also followed all the school policies. And we had two surveys. And as you all know,  Our process took a lot longer than others. So we were very proud that we even had more respondents in our second survey. We had public participation. There were two committee meetings that we had virtually.  We had emails that were addressed to the committee or our principal that really addressed concerns and thoughts that the public had about our school and what they felt might be appropriate to this exploration of a new name. What was really  amazing for our particular group was that our principal was really able to talk via phone with some people in the Rose Hill community to get a sense of what was important and also to get a background about Rose Hill and also the building in which our school is currently located.  With all of this information brought to the committee, we were able to extend that to our students. Our students did an amazing job of really trying to explore the historical and the geographical importance of Rose Hill. And so the students really felt like  They had to be engaged in the history of the school and its surroundings before they could engage on a new journey with the merger of the two schools. They were able to use this information that they gathered to design a mural and also to get with the committee and brainstorm new ideas  for the new school. One of the things that they did have that was really neat was a word association and it was amazing to see what words these middle school and high school students thought about that represented their school and how they felt about each other in the sense.  So after further consideration, the committee and superintendent recommend the name Community Lab School based on the fact that it captures the vision and the mission of the new school. When we were either doing our survey or getting feedback from the public or even talking with our students and staff, the word community kept popping up. We felt like  This was a word that really embodied how students feel when they walk into the school, as well as the staff to include teachers and also the parents. They feel like the school is a community. The students also really wanted  as a word that was incorporated in the name of the school. They felt like this was a word that tied both the middle school and the high school together based on the type of learning style and teaching that goes on in the school. The nice thing about this name also is that it avoided confusion of having two schools in the division with the same name.  We just felt that, you know, this was a long process, but an amazing one, and we feel like this name really embodies the school, the community, and the people that it serves. Any questions for us?",

And it was an interdisciplinary project that was an art incorporation with the history of social studies standards.  at the time of, that was relative to segregation in that era. So the students worked with two muralists, two quite well-known muralists in the area to come up with the design. So through Zoom, the muralists worked with our students as the students then worked with their teachers through the historical legacy, through interviews and things like that, and came up with  pieces that combined into a whole portrait of this, which is on now on the Meals on Wheels building. So it really captured the essence, I think, of the philosophical and pedagogical approach that we want for all kids at all levels, at all times, in which they're integrating the disciplines they're learning in authentic ways with a culminating project  engaging with the community throughout the process. So it was really an amazing process to watch unfold. One in which I must admit, as principal, when I heard we're gonna do this over Zoom, I thought, okay, well, this might be pretty interesting to see. And right there, you're looking at the end result. So it's possible to do that kind of learning and teaching and learning over Zoom. And they did a fine job with that.",

But I do want to take a second and I really want to express my appreciation to the name review committee members who participated on the school name review committees for Virginia Murray and for Murray Charter School. I had a chance to sit on a couple of their meetings and I know from visiting with them, they put a great deal of effort and time and thoughtfulness into their committee membership.  They've all been thorough. They were really thorough as you can see tonight. And I believe that they fully met their charge, both based on school board policy and in the roles that they're chosen roles as community leaders. I don't need to say anything about the recommendation, but I would say that one of the really things that stands out for me is that the policy does not speak to the level that these schools have taken student engagement into the process.  The policy is it lays out the dates, the times, the activities of the committee. But these school leaders and the leaders of the committees have really created a situation for students where I think as Teller said, it's tangible. And I would say it's authentic as a process because they're really going to be part of an outcome that has meaning for them, the name of their school. And that's what high quality teaching and learning is really all about.  So I want to say that. And then what I want to say next is that we are going to begin working on Jack Jewett tomorrow. So we'll be having our first meeting with the staff at the school to talk about Jack Jewett. That will be the next school that we are working on.",

    "text": "Good evening, school board members. I'm Jackson Zimmerman. I'm your school finance officer. Happy April. Tonight, I'm bringing forward an agenda item regarding use of one-time fund balances for CIP projects.  that are being recommended by staff. This is a continuation of our financial report that we provided on February 11th, where we had a significant discussion regarding fund balance. One of the things that is important to remember when we go back and look at fiscal year 1920, the very start of the pandemic, but before the pandemic really hit, we were having a positive financial year.  We were experiencing some savings regarding health insurance. We had good enrollment, which was yielding additional state dollars. And then the pandemic hit. At that point in time, we expected significant declines in revenues, both state and local. But as the year progressed, those reductions in revenues did not take place at all.  So we finished the 19-20 fiscal year in extremely positive financial position. As part of the current fiscal year, 2021, we're using a million dollars in fund balance in the current year for our budget. We are going to be receiving additional revenues and have some savings in the current year. We're making a one-time payment to school staff  We expect to make that payment at the end of April. Uh, and then we're bringing forward a recommendation as we had said during our February 11th meeting for the use of approximately $4 million of fund balance for one time projects to be, um, completed for the next school year. And that does yield, uh, still at the expected.  good fund balance at the end of the current fiscal year using that $1.4 million. So when we start talking about the projects that we're recommending be considered, go back to the school board's CIP request that was actually adopted by the school board. School safety improvements were number one on the new projects list.  None of those projects or not all of those projects were funded during that time frame. And so we're bringing forward a request to address school safety issues that were part of the school board's CIP request that did not get funded. Another component that we're bringing forward is technology replacement items. Again, this was partially funded, but not completely funded.  So that's those are the some of the reasons why we're choosing these particular projects. And for the specifics of the projects that we're recommending going to be asking Lindsay snotty Miss Lindsay snotty to present items on school security improvements.",

    "text": " Good evening, I'm Lindsay Snoddy, Deputy Director of Building Services. And I'd like to start with a little background about what we currently have in place as far as the front school vestibule configurations. Back in 2014, we had CEPTED reports or evaluations completed at all schools. And CEPTED stands for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design. Something they identified during these evaluations is that the front entrances needed improvement. If you look at the picture of the right on the top, you'll see that there,  a visitor can go into the school without going to the office first. So for the next four years, we worked on securing the main entry reconfigurations. Started in 2014 and this work carried through to 2018. For about 13 of the schools, the reconfigurations are very simple. We could do it without major construction. But for the remainder of the schools, we did need small additions or more major construction projects.  If you look on the right on the bottom, this is what Baker Butler looked like after the reconfiguration, and you'll see that a visitor goes into the vestibule, is then forced to enter through the office area where they'll go through the visitor management process, and then they would gain entry to the school. All schools now currently have this configuration. Because we have these configurations in place, it allows us to add the next layer of security to our front entryways.  And this is what we're proposing tonight is a buzzing camera system that will be at the front entrance of each school and then electronic control of the door from the main office into the school. These security initiatives will bring us in alignment with school security industry standards and in line with all of our surrounding school communities. The estimated cost for this portion of the project is about $209,000. I'm gonna take you through  The entryway and the doors that would be controlled. At doorway number one, this is typically open at schools now, this would be a locked door and the Buzz and Sys camera system would be mounted near this door number one. Inside the office, the office administrators or any administrators at the front office area would have access to a video screen and an intercom system.  When the visitor approaches the door, they would buzz in the system, and they would be, the door would be unlocked by the office administrator, and they would be allowed to come to door two. At that point, they go through the visitor management process, and then they would be allowed entry into door three. Door four would remain locked at all times as well. The second portion of this project is electronic access badge systems.  This would replace keys, essentially, and this could be the ID badge for the staff as well. We piloted this program at Woodbrook Elementary when we did the major addition and renovation work. Because that was successful, we were able to expand this to two additional schools through security equipment grant funding through the state. And we've planned these systems to also continue at Red Hill, Scottsville, and Crozet through the capital improvements.  The estimated cost for bringing this to have parity at the other remaining schools is $1.35 million. Benefits of the system make it easier for staff to access the building from playground and outside learning areas. If a staff member loses a card, we can quickly and easily deactivate it, as opposed to somebody losing a key, it's a little bit more difficult to locate.  The system keeps detailed logs of who's accessing the building and when, which is very helpful for administrators. Through the software, we can change the access privileges for staff members in a few seconds. And we have the ability to restrict access to the primary entrance to decrease the false security alarms that we tend to get outside school hours. And again, here's a recap of the cost for these two proposals we're bringing on the security side.  For the entryway controls with the buzzing camera system, we're looking at $209,000. And for the electronic access controls with the badge keys, that's $1.35 million. We're going to pause on this topic. I'm going to introduce Dr. Christine Diggs to talk about the technology replacement program. Thank you.",

    "text": "Thank you, Ms. Snoddy. Good evening. I'm Christine Diggs, your chief technology officer. And I'm pleased to be here this evening to talk about technology funding.  The school division's technology program is funded through several programs. This slide provides a snapshot of these funding sources. The school fund operating budget supports the operations of our department, including staff costs. Staff include our technology support specialists, our learning technology integrators, and our centrally based staff. The operating budget also pays for everyday costs, such as contract services, maintenance, and licensing costs for the division.  There's an annual transfer from the school fund to the Computer Equipment Replacement Special Revenue Fund to support computer replacements, specialty computers and labs, audiovisual systems, and other school-based systems. The CIP Technology Program, which funds classroom technology, operational support, and network operations, is what we'll be discussing this evening.  In 2019, the school board requested an increase to the program of 8.2 million for the five-year CIP beginning in fiscal year 21. The level of funding for all of our technology programs has not increased to keep pace with the increases that we've seen in enrollment, services, student-to-device ratios, and equipment costs. In particular, there has been no funding for display technology replacement, which I will elaborate more on in the next slide.  Ultimately, the recommended increase for the CIP technology replacement program was not funded through that CIP process. The proposed key changes relate to display technologies, because display technology replacement needs are a big concern for our school division. There are many display devices in schools that need to be replaced, and not having had a replacement cycle in place in previous years has created a current state of haves and have-nots across our schools.  The data on this next slide illustrates that inequity. This slide reflects our current state from just prior to the pandemic. The message we hear consistently from teachers and principals is the need for modern display technology. As you can see here, 13% of our classrooms have interactive display boards, primarily as a result of building modernization projects. The proposed plan will take a phased approach because our needs are so great.  The plan we are proposing, which is on the next slide, thank you, will be a two-phase approach. A 2.5 million allocation will enable us to provide interactive display boards for learning spaces in all of our elementary and middle schools. And then phase two will cover our high schools and conference rooms with that funding to be determined. And now at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Zimmerman. Thank you.",

    "text": "Good evening. I'm Maya Kumazawa, Director of Planning and Budget. And as Mr. Zimmerman mentioned, since we are on the topic of the CIP, I have just a couple of slides tonight to provide you with an update on the Crozet expansion project. As a reminder, this project includes an addition of approximately 35,000 square feet by adding classrooms, support spaces, and an expanded kitchen, cafeteria, and media center.  We also plan on replacing the HVAC system as well as making other improvements to the existing building and outdoor areas. The design for this project began more than one year ago. And in December, the school board approved an appropriation of $20.4 million in construction funds to move forward with the project. We've recently received bids to construct this expansion and we're excited to begin the work next month to stay on our schedule for opening,  for the 22-23 school year. The update that I'd like to provide is that based on the information that we have so far, we're looking to appropriate an additional $1 million for this project. We had been holding this additional funding in reserve, not fully knowing how the bids would come in. We've seen that costs have increased during the pandemic, resulting in higher than originally anticipated bids. And we'd also like to move forward with additive bid items that are listed on the slide.  So in summary, we will be requesting that the board of supervisors appropriate an additional $1 million for this project that will be moved from within CIP funds. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mr. Zimmerman.",

Quite a few of our people who spoke to in public comment talked about the four by four plan and whether or not quite a few of them, at least quite a few of the students talked about problems with the testing. So will there be any allowances  or could staff work to find out whether or not any allowances could be made for the testing of students this time since the 4 by 4 has produced quite a few problems. And also maybe whether staff could just review that. I think we were just using that this year, but whether or not any other review of those plans are needed.",

    "text": "Would you like an answer, Mr. Page? Yes, of course.  All right, so a couple things. One is just a little fact check. We never did do the four by four schedule in the past. It was brought before the board as a budget solution during the Great Recession. And it was never adopted as a full schedule. We ended up doing something called a hybrid. That seems to be a term in education when you do a little something and a little something else.  And it wasn't abandoned because it didn't work. It just never got off the ground. So I think it's important just to point that out. We actually did a lot of research before proposing it. Or actually, that's not true. The board voted on it. And then staff kind of was trying to figure out how to do it. So we did a lot of research on it. And there was  There's virtually no difference in student outcomes. It really boils down to whether you have buy-in from the community, buy-in from teachers, buy-in from the school staff to make it work. It's like a lot of programs like that.  So that's just a historical fact because I was right in the middle of it when it was going on. So the thing to think about though is the high school principals are really not putting out to their communities that they have adopted a four by four schedule. For some reason at the school levels, the school counselors appear to be talking to children about different types of school schedules  And I would like to just say that they don't need to do that. So if you're a school counselor, if you're listening tonight, that's not a necessary conversation right now. The conversation really ought to be about what are going to be the best classes for children to take to support their learning needs. The second thing I will say is that the school principals are awaiting the outcome of a board decision on the schedule for next year.  Because if we have five days a week, full school, and what we will, we're also what we, in addition to that, if we were to have that, then we would have a fully virtual school that was not attached to our schools. So it would be its own school. Then you would not need to have something like a four by four schedule because you wouldn't have  virtual school students attending in tandem at their school with school students in person. So that as you're correct, Mr. Page, that was done as a way to accommodate the hybrid scheduling that was going on this year to try to just help students not to have to juggle too many things at one time. If we were to recommend five days a week in-person learning for next year,  And if we were to also have a fully virtual school, which I will say we are going to be advertising a principal position for a fully virtual school after spring break, because either way, we're going to want to do that, then we would not need to do or the principals would probably not see the need to do something like a four by four schedule. They could go back to the alternating day schedule, which  You know, it is true what the students said, it's a very popular schedule.",

I do know that our teachers, and they really do put in and go the extra mile, the teachers do run sessions for students to get prepared to take the AP exams if they had the class in the fall. That's pretty much across the board. They put a lot of extra time and effort. And when the high school teachers come forward and say that they're doing that,  They're doing that. I mean, they're very motivated to help their kids do well on those exams. That still is not a great alternative. It's not the best thing because it requires a lot of extra time.  an effort for both students and teachers when you do that. But it is a solution.
