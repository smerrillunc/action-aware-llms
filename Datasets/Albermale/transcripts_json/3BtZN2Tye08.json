    "text": " County School Board to order. For our moment of silence, we'd like to have a special remembrance of one of our teachers who passed recently.  Powerful ideas sometimes are described as throwing a rock in a river and watching it generate huge ripples that keep getting larger until they encompass a large area. This analogy can fit people as well as ideas. And so it was with Pete Fittner. To give you a sense of the length of his service, he was hired by Joe Vining to teach at Brownsville right out of ed school. In those days, Brownsville had 180 students.  Pete also supported math students at Aetna Hurt and Woodbrook, and taught at Burleigh, where he received our community's highest award for teaching, the Golden Apple.  His principal, Cassandra Blount, called him a trifecta as a teacher. She described his three superpowers as always building confidence in his students, treating students in a way that makes them want to reach their highest expectations, and he was so skilled in his methods that he could easily adapt to any student's need. He was known at Burleigh as King of the Dungeon, referring to the sixth grade's location on the basement level floor of the school.  When you help kids begin to find their place in the world, Pete once said, you begin to find yourself too. Once you embrace who you are, the more you can give to help the students. If you are doing it right, the kids help you through the day. They help you as much as you help them. I want my students to fight for themselves and what they believe in was one of Pete's favorite thoughts. I tell them fight for you and fight for what you want.  No matter what happens, you have to keep moving forward. You have to keep fighting. Pete's wife, Nancy, who teaches at Brownsville, said he kept doing that right up until this week. And Pete passed yesterday afternoon. Our condolences and our gratitude go out to the Fittner family. And the next time we see a ripple in that water, we will think of Pete and all the lives that he lifted up. We will now have a moment of silence.  This meeting being conducted electronically, we have to read this into our minutes for each meeting. The minutes of this meeting should reflect that this meeting is being held electronically, pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance, because the COVID-19 pandemic  makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location. The meeting is being communicated to the public electronically through Zoom and streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website. And public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting room feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission. And now to introduce our board members, Dr. Kate Acuff,",

Big projects are coming to conclusion there's some loose ends, but for the most part, those are complete but we're about to embark on a new construction project.  And when I say we, it's the greater we of the community, the Boys and Girls Club Center is breaking ground and there's a breaking ground ceremony this Saturday that I believe you've all been invited to. And I just want to extend our gratitude to the club and all their partners for all their work and donations and partnership in making that center come to fruition. So we are very excited to see that come out of the ground and serve our students shortly.

    "text": "Good evening, school board members, staff present, as well as listeners.  Bernard Harrison, Assistant Superintendent. This past Saturday, Albemarle County Public Schools parted with the African American Pastors Council, the city of Charlottesville, and Charlottesville Public Schools to host the ninth annual back to school bash on the downtown mall.  There were over 1,200 backpacks and kits with school supplies offered at no cost to students from the area in grades K through 12. This is a sample of a nice backpack that was presented to each student.  They all received this nice kit with a lot of necessary supplies from pencils to markers, to notebooks, to pencil sharpeners, very nice stuff. I should also say there was a very strong collaborative effort on the part of several departments to make this happen.  For example, the Office of Instruction contributed funding to the purchase of the backpacks and the kits. Our technology support team provided on-site demonstrations about the use of several online tools that our students and families are expected to use this school year.  such as the Parent Portal, Seesaw, Schoology, they did an awesome job.  Our transportation department recruited drivers on site and answered questions from families regarding preparation for the first couple of days of school. And our office of community engagement provided these coloring kits right here to like the kindergarten students, they love these things. We also provided these very lightweight  Albemarle County stringed backpacks with earbuds for them as well. In addition, we had our superintendent of school on site. Dr. Haas extended greetings to the over 2000 plus parents and students present as well. He was there the entire time greeting all those who visited our table.  I think we all had a wonderful experience that day. And one thing that Dr. Haas and I talked about, we were reminded of the rapidly changing diverse community that we're serving. It was a real positive experience. Thank you for taking the time to listen to this announcement.",

We had a technology table. I was really impressed with our technology department that one of the things they handed out were cards that were in English on one side, Spanish on the other. And the most important thing on the card was a barcode that could be scanned.  with a cell phone so that if a parent has a device at home and it's not working, they can scan that, put their phone number in it and get a call from our technology department to get help on resolving the issue. If you did ask me three years ago, two years ago, would we be doing that kind of outreach work to say to parents, say to families, call our help desk or we'll call you  I would not have believed it. So I'm really proud of that department. And then the other thing I would mention is we did have our transportation department on hand to give out information about our routes and things like that. So really appreciate everyone doing that. And if you haven't had a chance yet to check out the technology truck, we now have our own technology truck that  actually can function as a small classroom, as a display. Parents can plug in and get troubleshooting for their devices and it's mobile. So it was really wonderful. I do wanna say that we really had a wonderful opening of school on Monday. As I went around visiting schools, the only thing that was different from when schools opened in 2000,  And 19 was masks. Everything else, the enthusiasm, the day one focus on student learning, the relationship building and a lot of the excitement, the positive attitudes were all the same. And I'm super proud of all of our educators and support staff for pulling off an opening.  I was having a conversation with Ms. Lee earlier this afternoon and she reminded me that opening school requires everything everyone has every year to get that off the ground. And doing it this year and our staff pulling on that extra resolve, their skill sets and all the new things they've learned really added a lot to that effort. And yet everyone pulled it off and it was just wonderful.  I've got four more schools to visit tomorrow and I will have visited all of them. And I have to say that the staff at the schools and the students and families have just been amazing. We do have a brief video that I'm gonna ask Ms. Johnston to queue up. I think it's about three and a half minutes. If Ms. Johnston is there.",

And similar to last year, I'm seeing lower numbers that are at a lower grade. So again, we'll bring back more detail at the next meeting, but that's what we know right now.",

    "text": " All right, good evening board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, the chief of strategic planning for the school division. And I'm here tonight with Eileen Gomez to provide our COVID update. So let's go ahead and get started. As you know, we have realigned the format of our update with the most recent guidance provided to us by the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Education.  And as all public schools in Virginia are now required to open five days a week for in-person instruction, the guidance is no longer geared toward the conditions under which schools should open for students, but the newly updated guidance instead provides five steps for school divisions to consider as operational decisions, whoops, as operational decisions are made for and during the 21-22 school year. So the first of these is to evaluate the current level of community disease transmission.  The level of community transmission is determined using two measures. The first is the total number of new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. The most recent data we have is from Tuesday, August 24, and at that time our current seven day total per 100,000 people was about 108, putting us in the high transmission category.  The second measure is the percent of NAAT tests that are positive during the past seven days. Our latest percent positivity is 4.6%, which puts us in the low transmission category. When the two indicators are at different levels, the VDH recommends using the indicator with the higher value as your community transmission level. So our current community transmission level is at the high level. The second step is to understand the level of community vaccination.  And our vaccination rates, I'm happy to say again, continue to be a bright spot for us. In Albemarle County, we have 81.8% of 12 to 15 year olds and 85.5% of 16 to 17 year olds receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Those numbers are up from 78.2 and from 83.2 respectively since we last updated the board.  Our fully vaccinated numbers for our 12 to 15 year olds are 71.8% up from 68.5. And for our 16 and 17 year olds, they are at 77.6 up from 75.8. And so the third step is to consider the level of impact that the virus is having within our schools.  You'll recall that last week, last board meeting, we couldn't report on this because we didn't have students in school, but now that they're back, we can again use this metric in our operational strategy. And as expected, we have had sporadic cases in our schools as students return this week, but to date have no evidence of transmission within our schools. So we consider that indicator to be low. Student and staff absenteeism is not being impacted to a large degree by the pandemic. And each of these indicators, along with our overall indicator,  are at the low level. And I'd like to remind the board that our COVID dashboard is live and up to date. You can access it from the homepage of the Albemarle County Schools site. And if you go to the dashboard, you'll see that this week we have had 12 total positive cases in our schools. Eight of those were student cases and four of those were staff cases. And that's resulted in a total current quarantine of 21 students and one staff member.  The final two steps that we use to determine, yes. Do you know if the members of the staff that had it were vaccinated? That I do not know. I would defer to Eileen. I'm not sure we know that or not. Eileen, do you have any information on that?",

And finally tonight, I'd like to provide you with some updated information about our staff vaccination program for the board's resolution, beginning September 15 always CPS employees are going to be required to be vaccinated or show proof of a weekly negative coven test.  Employees will attest to their vaccination status through a survey and will be asked to show proof of vaccination if contact tracing is needed. That survey is set to launch no later than Monday, August 30. We may have it out as soon as tomorrow. And once it does launch for our employees, they're going to have one week to complete it and send that information into us.  As you know, we want to keep everything confidential, so vaccination status will not be shared unless that knowledge is necessary for contact tracing. And as vaccine status changes, employees will update us with that information. In terms of the testing of employees who choose not to get vaccinated, we are currently in the procurement process for a COVID testing provider and hope to have more information on that in the very near future.  And so I thank you for your time tonight. And Eileen and I and other staff members would be happy to take any questions or comments you might have about where things stand with our COVID update.",

So if you recall, the definition of a close contact last year was if you were within six feet of an individual for 15 minutes or longer over the course of 24 hours. In the spring, the CDC provided an exemption that the VDH has adopted that allows that to be reduced to three foot in an indoor classroom setting.  which was encouraging to us and limits the number of kids we have to quarantine. Unfortunately, that exemption does not apply to the bus. And so in the bus, we are quarantining kids in a six foot radius. And so what we're finding based on these first couple of cases is the majority of our quarantines are due to bus riders.",

The work session this evening is focusing on why there's a reading gap and how we will narrow and eliminate that gap.  We have two goals for tonight, to develop an understanding of how ACPS is approaching the elimination of achievement gaps in reading by following the science of reading, and to deepen the commitment to the strategic plan's key strategies. This work session is divided into three parts. First, you will hear about how narrowing the reading gap connects to our strategic plan. Then you will learn the national research on reading gaps from our partners at the Education Advisory Board. You're going to be able to ask  questions about what you hear from that presentation. And finally, you will learn how ACPS has been responding to implementing the science of reading. At the end of the work session, we will offer time for discussion and feedback.

All the work sessions that we have with the board this year will have a direct connection to Learning for All, the Albemarle County strategic plan. We hope that you'll see tonight that the work we're doing in Albemarle around closing the reading gap will help our learners engage in authentic, challenging, and relevant learning experiences as outlined in our vision.  will help us to end the predictive value of race, class, gender, and special capacities on our children's success, and will build relationships with families and communities and help us know every student as we state in our mission. You should also see a clear connection to our values of equity by providing every student with the level of support necessary to thrive and our value of excellence as we mitigate barriers and provide opportunities for every student to be academically successful.  Our work tonight directly connects with our thriving students goal. And we have a specific strategy from our plan that explicitly identifies the being a reader resources as one that when implemented with fidelity will help us to meet our goals. So as we begin tonight, I'd like to introduce you to Sarah mains from the education advisory board.  As you know, we've partnered with EAB for the past several years as a research partner for the work that we're doing in Albemarle County. In addition to the targeted on-demand research they provide, EAB identifies two national-level research projects each year based on feedback they're hearing from superintendents around the nation.  One of the most recent projects that they've conducted is a deep dive into the science of reading, which has become their report narrowing the third grade reading gap. We're happy to have Sarah with us tonight. She is the director of K-12 subject matter. She is a director and K-12 subject matter expert with EAB.  She works directly with EAB partner school districts to help use their research and advisory services to help them solve some of our most significant problems. And tonight she'll provide an overview of the work EAB has done around the problem that we want to solve in Albemarle, closing the third grade reading gap. A quick note with technology.  We are Sarah is coming to us from the DC area tonight and they've had some pretty significant storms roll through, and she lost her Wi Fi in her house so she is calling in from her phone. I'm going to be driving her slides for her, but she is going to be talking through us so bear with us for one second while I get Sarah slides up, and we will get the presentation started. Thank you.

    "text": "Thank you. We did we I live right outside of Washington, D.C., and we had some massive storm ripped through here at about four o'clock this afternoon, and we no longer have Wi-Fi. And we also just discovered that we think part of our house is actually hit by lightning because we lost power and part of our house. So  I appreciate you bearing with me on sort of patchworking this together. You know ideally we would be in person doing this. That's not an option with COVID. Sort of next best would be that I could see you all right now and you could see me and that's obviously not an option. So we're going to make it work. As Patrick said I work directly with school districts on several different issues and sort of those pressing challenges.  And one of the ones we do we are really just hearing a lot from districts is the need for help with creating gaps especially in the context of COVID and you know how that has really exacerbated gaps for students. So I this is you know part of a much larger body of work. We are going to go through.  really the context and the sort of why and what of this. And then I understand this is going to serve as sort of a springboard for, you know, where you talk about next in terms of literacy approach there. So I'm really pleased to be here. And I do also want to add an aside, congratulations on opening.  We are so excited for school to start here in Montgomery County next week. So it is an enormous challenge. So I hope you all can pat yourselves on the back, at least temporarily. So, okay. I am going to, I'm looking at the presentation at home. Hopefully you're looking at my title slide right now. I'm going to switch  to the first slide here which says far too many kids can't read at an early age and we'll just get rolling here. Feel free to let me know if there are any tech problems or you need me to slow down whatever it is. Okay. So you know part of the reason we're here having this conversation is that you know districts understand that we have a problem in this country in terms of reading scores.  And that they really are not where they should be. You can see here on this slide NAEP scores for the past 10 years or so. And you know it's a pretty clear picture that we do not have enough kids reading at proficient levels. And that growth while we have seen some growth you know over the past decade it's really been very minimal.  I'm going to switch slides here. And interestingly, while we do know that reading outcomes are particularly acute for certain populations, you can see on the left side of the slide here for, you know, black and Hispanic populations as compared to white and Asian, and then on the right, English language learners, for example. However, if you look at the number at the bottom of the slide,  30 percent of struggling readers actually come from households with at least one college-educated parent. So we have a problem here that really does transcend demographics and we need to approach holistically in our districts. So I'm going to switch slides here. And so interestingly we know there is some controversy around NAEP as a as a mechanism.  Some folks feel it is too rigorous of a measure. You know, other folks disagree. And what this has caused is that in addition to NAEP now, we also have 30 different assessments across this country that are used for, to assess fourth grade regent levels. And so, and those assessments,  tell a very different story if you look at them compared to NAEP. Some over inflate scores. Some are much harder in fact than NAEP. So we have a sort of confusing picture here. I'm going to switch slides to say that despite the sort of different measures we know there is we know kids are not where we need them to be.  And it really, you know, debates over assessments and what you, you know, think is a good measure really shouldn't distract from the reality of not providing students with high quality reading instruction at an early age. It, you know, very logically has an impact on their ability to learn other subjects at the same time.  But it also we see that 75 percent of students who are not reading proficiently by 3rd grade actually never reach that proficiency in future grades. We also know that they are less likely to attend college and it is much harder to find a living wage as they you know move into adulthood. I'm going to switch slides here.  To the sort of first piece of good news and this is that virtually every student can learn to read. You see some data here that comes from the National Institutes of Health where about 95 percent of elementary school students really should be able to learn. You can see on the left side of the slide here about 30 percent of students will learn to read kind of no matter what.  They you know might have some sort of pre-hardwiring that just makes it a lot easier for them. As you move around the circle to the right you'll see that 50 percent of students are should be able to learn with high quality Tier 1 instruction. Only about 15 percent of students are going to require that you know additional time and support and sort of Tier 2 level support.  And there's only about 5 percent of elementary students who have a severe cognitive impairment that they will always struggle to read. So this is good news. Kids should be able to do this. So if we move to the next slide you'll see you know we we know that districts are trying their very hardest. We as part of our work at EAB we talk to districts  all over the country, because we really want to know not just what's happening in the research, but what is happening on the ground? What are people actually doing? And so, you know, we heard a number of things. You can see on the left side of the slide here, everything from extending school days to updating curricular materials. We even heard of a couple districts that have been buying  launching eyeglass drives because they realized that some of the kids couldn't read or couldn't see and so that was having an impact on their ability to learn to read. We also know that you know there is a great development in terms of pushing for universal pre-K access which is which is great but it's not going to solve the whole problem because research has found that while that can set you up sort of initially  gains made in pre-K specifically as it relates to reading pretty much disappear after kindergarten. So it's certainly part of the puzzle but it's not it's not the whole solution. So if I move on to sort of another piece of good news here there is a ton of research that we can look to to really understand how our brains learn to read.",

    "text": "So I'm going to switch now to this kind of very rough  almost comical, if you will, timeline of history in terms of human existence. And we provide this here because in the context of understanding how our brains learn to read, it's really important to understand that we're not actually, we haven't actually evolved yet to be readers naturally. You can see here that the spoken language  um have been around for a lot longer. We have you know we've really evolved to to use spoken language. Written language has actually only existed for less than 3 percent of human existence. So our brain hasn't evolved yet to learn to do this naturally. I'm going to switch slides here to our first picture of the brain. Again this is  We are not scientists so this you know don't take this as sort of you know a scientific representation of the brain. But we we use this here to help us understand that all of that neuroscience that shows how we learn to read points to four very specific areas of our brain that must be involved in reading.  And I'm going to start here with the auditory cortex. It plays, you know, in terms of, you know, as you're reading or learning to read, it is involved in phonological processing, which essentially means it allows you to discern and recognize unique speech sounds, which is essential to be able to decode sounds.  Then if we move on to the frontal lobe, this is what helps us with that actual speech production and developing fluency as well as comprehension. The third area is the visual cortex. As you could imagine, the word visual, it helps in actually recognizing visually printed letters and words.  And then the fourth part is the angular gyrus, which helps us with those sound to symbol connections, you know, print to speech circuits, that sort of thing. And kind of, you know, when we see letters and words, kind of understanding the visual representation of those. So when we move to the slide where it kind of pulls it all together in one, you know, picture of the brain with all four pieces of these,  you can see here that there really is no single sort of reading region. And in order to be able to use these four parts of our brain to learn to read, we have to develop these neural circuits or sort of, you know, communication, um, you know, highway kind of, uh, imagery or white matter, some people call it as well. Um, but we have to,  develop these in order for those four parts of the brain to work together. And interestingly that white matter the optimal time for developing that is that sort of kindergarten through third grade time frame. And in fact 56 percent of the variance in reading outcomes is actually accounted for  But the change in the volume of that white matter between kindergarten and third grade. So it's great that we know now that we have these four pieces of our parts of our brain that must work together but we have to actually intentionally work to develop that white matter because it doesn't develop necessarily on its own. And that's why this early reading you know focus on this early reading years  is so critical because there's an actual connection to how our brain develops. So I'm going to switch to the next slide where we, you know, when we're in person, we like to lead this reading simulation. I'm going to walk you through it a little bit, try and walk you through a little bit of it here without it being too awkward. But the reason we do this is  because, you know, we've all been reading for a long time and we can sort of do it naturally. And so it's really easy to forget just how difficult that process can be, you know, especially at first. And, and that it's actually a very complex process to sort of bring those multiple parts of our brain together. So we do this reading simulation to kind of put everybody in the mindset of those youngest readers.  We use the International Phonetic Alphabet because most people haven't seen it and it actually serves as a really good way to learn brand new symbols. And so the way we generally do this is we, you know, we teach sounds and then we, you know, by mapping the sounds to symbols and then we work up to blending those sounds into words and then, you know, practice reading in a short  And again, it is very helpful for everyone to kind of not only sort of have to force your brain to learn something new again, because it's actually a really complex process, but also to understand the dynamics of what happens when you're in a classroom and everyone around you is trying to do the same thing, but they may all be learning it in very different ways.  I'm going to rely on you all to be good participants here. I'm going to kind of put on a teacher hat for a little bit, and I'm going to teach you all some new sounds. So Patrick, if you want to let me know if people are participating or if we've got any sort of tech trouble here. But what I want you all to do is to really engage in this because I'm going to prompt you  as if you were students in a classroom.",

Patrick, if you could just point to them as I say them, that would be helpful. We're going to start all the way on the left. And the first symbol here represents the sound F, as in bet.

It's a relationship between a king and a fish and buying a ring. And it highlights not only just how important that decoding process is and understanding how to develop fluency,  But also the comprehension and really having that context and how important that is for comprehension because not all students have the same connections and same background knowledge to these passages for example. And it's not always going to make sense in the way that we think it does just because we're presenting it as a literacy lesson. So.  I realized that was a little bit short, but I hope that that kind of helped you all understand, too, that that decoding piece is essential. And, you know, as we move to the next slide, research confirms that strong readers decode. You can see some really strong research on the left.  which includes longitudinal work and some meta-analyses, but that also poor readers tend to rely very heavily on context clues rather than being able to understand that decoding process.",

    "text": "For example, if you have pictures on a page and you can look at the picture and  I think I understand what's going on. And so that becomes your some, you know, it makes sense in early grades because there are so many pictures and books. But as kids move on in difficulty with their text, it is harder and harder to use context clues. And you realize that those students are actually really in trouble now because they never learned the decoding process. Thank you. That makes sense.  Sure. And as I mentioned, too, that, you know, those neural pathways and that white matter forms at early ages and is really critical in that decoding process. So if we miss that window, it's going to be really, really hard to catch up. So moving on to the slide about the simple view of reading, this may look familiar to some of you, but really was a way for researchers  to say, OK, if we think about reading comprehension, it's really an equation between reading or word decoding and the comprehension piece. The simple view of reading is evolving to sort of better understand or account for really other kind of learning differences, but the idea is still  The same that we have reading really at its core is a product of our ability to decode and how well we can sort of comprehend, you know, what we're exposed to. So moving on to kind of the phases of students reading development, you can see on this slide kind of the four major phases.  And we focus for the purposes of our research and our best practice advice on the two phases in the middle. And I think this slide is really interesting because it helps you understand how word decoding and language comprehension change over time in, you know, how big of a piece they play in the sort of progression of an early reader.  So when we, you know, move on to the next slide and say, okay, so what does all this science mean then for, you know, one piece of that simple view of reading, which is comprehension. And there were three primary components here. The first one is around morphological awareness, sort of understanding the structure of the words. The second is around explicit vocabulary instruction. We all know that we still have a very,  distinct word gap in this country and that, you know, kids can have differences of thousands of words in their vocabulary. So we need to be really, really intentional, explicit about that. And then the third piece for, you know, comprehension is, you know, again, that background knowledge piece. It's really important to make sure we're, you know, exposing kids to text that makes sense to them and they can draw meaning from.  So the second piece of that simple view of reading is the word decoding. And so, okay, well, what does the science then mean for word decoding? And again, that has three primary components here. We're gonna need to make sure that kids are getting direct instruction around phonemic awareness. As it turns out, the English language is fairly complicated in terms of speech sounds. You can see on the right, it actually has more speech sounds than, you know,  Mandarin, which, you know, we all think is, or I at least think is a very complicated language. The second piece is a mastery of print concepts, understanding things like, you know, capital letters, lowercase letters, punctuation marks. And then the third piece here is this phoneme graphing correspondence. And you'll recall, as I taught you those sounds, I was careful to make sure you understood how your mouth and your tongue interacted as you  expressed the sound. That is becoming, you'll see a tiny little picture here of something that's called a sound wall. And what it does is it is a picture of the mouth and the tongue next to the letter, you know, and the sound it should be making. These are becoming more common across elementary classrooms  Sometimes replacing word walls, which again, there's a fair amount of context clues involved in a word wall if there's a picture involved. What we really want kids to do is focus on the sound before they can get to the actual word of it.  Moving on to kind of, okay, well, what does this mean in the context of what we see happening in classrooms? And unfortunately, we still see a lot of unfamiliarity with foundational reading skills, oversimplification of phonemic awareness, really not dedicating enough time on this. And then again, this overemphasis on using context clues for decoding.  And as I switch slides, you know, and have mentioned that that limited phonics awareness really compounds future reading struggles. As text gets harder, it can lead to something that's called this fourth grade slump when kids are now not seeing those pictures as much in books. And sometimes you can actually see this slide back for, you know, advanced readers back to proficient, sometimes proficient readers back to basic readers.  because they didn't really get that foundation when they needed it. So as we think about this, OK, we have the science. We know most kids should be able to do this. We even understand now what this means in terms of instruction. Why are we still struggling? Part of this is because we have fairly deep-seated  deeply rooted beliefs about literacy instruction in this country. And haven't sort of been able to kind of signal on a national level in a way that people are, you know, really committing to. And you can see here a brief timeline of, you know, the not so affectionately called Reading Warn.  They, you know, back to the 1800s with Horace Mann actually opposing phonics in favor of whole words. We have kind of flip-flopped and kind of rollercoastered around on this over time in terms of what we choose to focus on and what we think is really going to work. But really, you know, two decades ago, a national reading panel came down very clearly in favor  the science of reading research and phonics instruction in schools but we still have complicating kind of opinions and theories and approaches to this of which balanced literacy while it sounds like a good thing actually gets can complicate this because it is interpreted very differently across institutions even sometimes within schools across classrooms. So.  Where this leads us to as we think about OK so how can we really really help schools and districts embrace the science of reading which provides a very clear blueprint for how we can help students learn to read. I'm going to move on to this slide which shows you a reading system. These are all the kind of decision making and policy oriented systems.  that we really need to be founded and sort of rooted in the science of reading. And fortunately if we switch to the next slide here you can see that we you know as I said we draw very heavily on the experiences of other districts. Three districts in particular that we highlight here all committed  to making sure that the science of reading was at the core of all of those policies and all of those decision-making structures. And you can see some phenomenal results here of, you know, performance before they really committed to making sure that their entire system was aligned with science. And then you can see the performance afterwards. And it is really dramatic.  And I also want to note that it's not because there are these particularly affluent districts with tons of resources and lots of capacity. You can see that these are really good representative districts that have a lot of diversity whether it's in terms of racial and ethnic but also in terms of student abilities and socioeconomic status. So.  This is kind of where we hope that districts will sort of say OK you know we understand now that we we really need to have this foundational systemic approach to our literacy efforts. These other districts committed to this have proven that it can be done and you know how can we now  really approach our system to make sure that it is aligned with the foundation of the science of reading and really get everybody on board so that you don't have variation from classroom to classroom. So I understand that you all are going to sort of use this as a springboard for looking at your system. But this is kind of the end of the part of the conversation that we do as folks.  about the context and the background. So I'm happy to take any questions that you might have at this point.",

So  As I mentioned this is part of a much much larger body of research and this kind of second part of this presentation is always about the exactly we said so so now what. How do we do this. And part of that focuses intentionally and explicitly on training and making sure that all teachers  not just you know literacy specialists all teachers in you know your K through 3rd grades are trained in the science of reading. There are a number of different ways to do that these days. There are some grow your own programs or also kind of vendor programs you can you know have someone come to your district.  But I also want to point out that we also think it's really, really important that principals get trained in this as well. And that's because we need principals to be literacy kind of champions, we call them, for the buildings. Not only to kind of, you know, sort of signal that this really is sort of how your institution does this, but also to serve as a resource.  for and a support system for your teachers especially as they're doing you know classroom walkthroughs or observations to really make sure that they are a team as they approach literacy efforts. So yes we would recommend teachers get this very you know clearly trained not just in sort of a one-off PD experience but we would also recommend that principals do so as well.",

    "text": " Hi there, I'm the mom of a first grade student. I've started getting curious about how my child is learning how to read in school. I'm a PhD level behavioral scientist and I made this video because I'm trying to make sense of some contradictions I see between the well-established science of reading and how kids are actually being taught to read.  Here's one thing I'm really confused about. Perhaps you've noticed your child being assigned books according to their just right reading level. These reading levels follow the alphabet like A, B, C, et cetera. What's strange is that these books often contain words that are pretty hard for a little kid to sound out, such as community or purple. It seems like kids are just supposed to memorize these words.  To make it easier, kids are taught tricks for how to guess words when they get stuck. They can, for example, guess a word that makes sense, they can use the picture to guess the word, and they can even just skip the word entirely. Now you might be wondering, can't kids also just use phonics?  It's true that phonics is suggested as one of various tools kids can use to figure out a word. But as I hope will become clear over the course of this video, what's actually happening in the early grades is that kids are not learning enough phonics skills to sound out the types of words that show up in the books they are actually reading. Furthermore, the other Q-based strategies, such as guessing from pictures or from context, are, according to experts, actually undermining their ability to read.  All of this controversy got me wondering, will my kid learn how to read this way? I decided to do an experiment to find out using Reading A to Z, also known as RAS Kids. This popular reading app uses books at the just right reading level. So I'm going to show you an online book, but what we learn here should apply to regular books that also use these just right levels.  Here's how I did my experiment. First, I had my daughter read a book on Raz kids. Then I had her read the same story, but this time with the pictures covered. Then I had her read the harder words from the story with no pictures and no context. And finally, I tested these words again the next day to see how much my daughter had learned.  So what do you think? Will she learn these new words even though she doesn't have the phonics skills to sound these words out? Let's see what happened.",

    "text": " Now, I'm not saying that it's all independent reading, but there is a lot of it. And it's not clear to me how a beginning reader who doesn't yet know how to read a lot of words is going to learn how to sound out new words and learn from her mistakes without a grownup looking over her shoulder. Maybe if we want kids to read independently, we should give them books with words they have actually been taught how to read.  So this brings me back to the word purple. Why was it so difficult for my daughter to learn how to read this word even though she was able to guess purple by looking at pictures and guess it again by looking at context? Well, it turns out that guessing words from different clues such as pictures, context, or repetitive sentence patterns is a highly inefficient and ineffective way to learn how to read.  Incredibly, this method, which is called three-queuing, is strongly promoted in the Lucy Calkins Reading Workshop curriculum, one of the best-selling reading programs in the U.S. Many children who learn these methods have to be retrained later before they can learn to read properly.  But here you might be wondering, don't we all use context to better understand what we're reading? Sure, we do use context for reading comprehension. However, before we can comprehend what we read, we must read the actual words themselves. This is known as decoding. If you can't properly decode, context is not going to help you make much sense of what you're reading.  Research has shown that people who are successful readers automatically process all the letters of a word as they are decoding. They do this because at some point when they were little, they learned how to sound out the words using the letters. People who are successful readers do not use 3Qing. They do not decode words from context, from pictures, or from sentence patterns.  This makes sense if you think about it. You're not going to be very successful reading the words in the Constitution or the Gettysburg Address if you're hunting around for clues. Decades of research have shown that it is in fact poor readers who continue to decode words using clues. People who read this way are slower at reading, they read more inaccurately, and they're more likely to find reading difficult and unpleasant.  Unfortunately, school districts such as ours across the country have spent millions of dollars on curricula that promote these ineffective strategies. Parents, educators, and activists have begun mobilizing to demand that kids start getting instruction that aligns with the science of reading.  So you might be wondering, what actually does work to teach a kid how to read the word purple? Well, to find out the answer to that question, please watch part two of this series, where I do another experiment, this time using phonics.",

And so as Miss Collins just referred to the diagram that she showed, we're not going to start right at the leadership or the instructor's part, we're going to start instructional materials. So one of the first things we did as a division three years ago was to adopt a reading framework  That's based on the science of reading. We chose being a reader affectionately known as bar. It's a comprehensive research based reading curriculum for grades K through to this year we've extended it to K through three that combined systematic sequential foundational skills instruction, and has a rigorous comprehension component that's integrated with social emotional learning.  We purchased being a writer from the same company collaborative classroom 10 years ago and this year we were able to update those materials, so that all teachers now have the second edition that's refreshed with some of the read alouds, as well as a systematic way to teach grammar.  Also, it's important to note that Zaretta Hammond, author of Culturally Responsive Teaching, is on the leadership board, which helps the publishers of the company keep equity at the forefront of their decision making when they're thinking about creating instructional materials. Curriculum frameworks. The Department of Instruction, we coaches, are working on this ongoing project  where we are creating curriculum frameworks for the division, specifically thinking about elementary K through five, and we should be able to share the third grade curriculum framework just this year in division day so that teachers can see it and we'll continue to work on that. It's our hope to have those presented and ready by the start of the school year 2022.  culturally relevant material read-alouds. We are working on giving teachers and principals a curated list of recent books that are culturally relevant to students. Our assessment. So our screeners that we have, PALS is K-3. Being a reader is  We have a placement assessment that we use for students, K through three, that's given to students to know exactly where their point of need is for instruction. And that's given early on in the school year. This year it will start on September 13th. Our diagnostic tool, being a reader, what you'll find in there is once students get into the small group reading, every four weeks, there is a mastery assessment test that tells teachers if the student is ready to continue on.  the next lesson. If they're not ready, there are remedial lessons that students will do, and then they take another mastery assessment test to make sure that they're ready to move on. Our summative assessment, as you all know, that we are working on our elementary reading dashboard. We're currently developing this dashboard that you all can look at quarterly to see across the board, K through five, how our students are doing with their reading instruction and development.  So with instructors, as you heard, professional development for teachers is a key strategy and one of the most significant ones.  So if you want to spend a little bit more time with this presentation, looking at the being a reader historical, how we started, we started with first, just introducing it to first grade. And then we moved on last year and we introduced it to kindergarten, second grade. This year, we're gonna open it up to third grade for those students who are one or two levels behind third grade expectations. And if you click on this link, it takes you to the full year round.  PD development that we have given to teachers. And we had our first session last Thursday. And each month, there is a new focus that helps teachers actualize being able to use being a reader, as well as have collaborative conversations, if they get stuck, or they have questions about instruction for students. At this time, I'd like to introduce several of our teachers who are currently using or  have been using being a reader, depending on what grade level they are. So I'd like to introduce Ms. Brittany Mullenix, Ms. Kim Geer, Ms. Kiara Samuels, and Ms. Danielle Joseph. And these teachers are gonna talk about the impact of the professional development that they have experienced thus far, what they've learned, and the progress that they professionally and their students are making in the classroom. And I think we'll start with Ms. Brittany Mullenix.",

    "text": " Hi everyone, I am Brittany Melinex and I am a teacher at Agnehart Elementary School. And as a teacher, before being a reader, I would spend many hours planning my literacy lessons to be sure I included every single component of the literacy diet. But since learning about being a reader and being trained in BAR, this program has been amazing for my students.  The fast paced nature and repetitiveness is great for students who need more practice. Each lesson and week builds on the previous lesson and is filled with small burst of phonological awareness, work with phonics, sight words, word study, writing, spelling and reading instruction.  FAR starts at the beginning of the year with creating a classroom literacy community by exposing students to rich read alouds and whole group instruction. As well as creating a learning environment, step by step with students, so they know and understand what learning looks like during literacy time.  Our focus is on building with phonemes and phonics while teaching students from day one the most effective reading strategy, decoding. Students are able to move through lessons differentiated to exactly where they are learning. And as a teacher, I'm able to see more of where my students are and how I can help them move forward and learn material they may be struggling with. My word study instruction for second grade has grown exponentially with using Binger Reader.  In addition to students receiving word study instruction on their individual spelling level, they're also exposed to more difficult features that they would have never seen before in other word study programs. And they're actually spelling with some of these features. I've used this program with kindergarten through second grade, and I see the benefit of children having continuity and understanding of the reading group format to further their growth.",

    "text": "Hi, good evening. My name is Kimberly Geer. In 2018, first grade teachers participated in Being a Reader professional development training sessions, which included watching Rebecca Denny, a collaborative classroom instructor and former teacher, give live instruction to students in a first grade classroom. Afterward,  Teachers then met in a room to reflect on what they observed and were given time to ask questions and talk about their wonderings. The collaborative classroom website called the Learning Portal has a plethora of resources and videos for teachers to use. In addition to the resources for teachers, there are colorful sound letter spelling posters for teachers to display and classrooms for students to use as visual aids to support their learning.  The Being a Reader program provides opportunities to build relationships in a deliberate way. In the beginning of the school year, students learn how to gather and use cooperative structures in which they are responsible to one another. Students work with partners during shared reading lessons. During this time, students participate in an activity called Turn to Your Partner. They are given a question to ponder and then a chance to talk about what they're thinking with their peer.  As the year progresses, students regularly discuss and solve problems related to their work together. As their relationships evolve, students feel connected to their peers. Therefore, they learn to take risks to grow academically and socially. The guide, excuse me, social and academic learning flourish when they are integrated and the Being a Reader program does this in a systematic way. And being that this is my third year teaching,  I'm being a reader and afraid I observed my students feel successful confident learners by using this program.",

    "text": " Yeah, I would like to add that one really important component of the Being a Reader manuals is that it has different sections for each lesson about how English language learners might interpret things differently, or different tips of like, this sound is not in this language, so you might have to teach it this way to students who speak a certain language, which  is very helpful, especially at Woodbrook with our ELL population, which we have so many different languages at Woodbrook. So that part of being a reader has been just very helpful because otherwise I would not really know the different parts of other languages and how just reading English might be difficult for people who do not speak English as their first language. So that's like one of the main components that I'm just like wowed about with being a reader.",

    "text": "All right. Also, just to add in from our slide, we have the ongoing CRT training for all of our teachers, but also to think about one of the strategic goals is equitable access. So the CRT training is working  helping teachers work with that. And then the SIPS training, that is the intervention for teachers. And it goes along with the program for being a reader. So when a student is having trouble and you've done the remediated lessons, the next part is to go to SIPS. And so all of our interventionists, as well as our SPED educators, are being trained in SIPS training. We've had it in some of our buildings in the past, but we have not had it in all of the buildings.  And so this is the first year we were able to purchase for all 15 elementary schools, the four kids for SIPS training. And it's really the first time all three tiers, tier one, tier two, tier three, are all kind of speaking the same language, wrapping our arms around our students who have not met benchmarks just yet.  So leadership, another key strategy that you saw from our diagram was to bring in all leadership to understand the science of reading. And to that end, we introduced the members of the board to being a reader when you all adopted the program. And then we introduced being a reader to all elementary principals during the spring of 2018. And as you heard from our presentation from Sarah,  All principals should be literacy champions. So at our August leadership meeting that just occurred, the EAB came and did a two-hour presentation, much like what you just experienced this evening. We've included the implementation of being a reader, which will be used to fidelity, K through three, in the strategic plan.  I would like to introduce two of our elementary principals, Ms. Maureen Jensen, Stony Point principal, and Mr. Seth Kennard, Baker Butler principal. Both principals were eager to start working on sharing information around the science of reading prior to our August leadership meeting, and then they were able to then bake in some of the information that was shared during the EAP presentation. And so now I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Maureen Jensen to speak first, and then you'll hear from  Seth Kennard.",

    "text": "Good evening, everybody. This is my first year as principal at Stony Point. And as your first year, as a first year principal, I think it's important to pick your focus wisely. And we are at Stony Point, doing school wide CRT certification and also focusing on the science of reading, because they do  actually work hand in hand. I thought that focusing on the science of reading was really important for teachers to really dig into the research on how the brain learns to read and used the presentation at our leadership meeting to construct an interactive session with the Stony Point teachers. We were, yeah,  all teachers pre-K through five, uh, working together. And the first thing we did actually was, uh, brainstorm, um, structures and strategies that we've used in the last couple of years in the language arts classroom. Um, and just put, put it all out there. What, what structure strategies and resources do you use in your pre-K through five classroom?  And then I went through a more direct approach with the science of reading, part of the presentation that you saw tonight and some other things. And then we got in grade level bands, pre-K, K and one, and then two and three and four and five, and had some critical conversations about the structures and strategies that we use.  And then came up with, based on the science of reading, what structures and strategies align with that research? And the grade level bands put a list of non-negotiables of their ELA block. Yes, being a reader is a non-negotiable. What particular categories or aspects in being a reader are we talking about that we want to keep in our language?  So we did that. And then at the end of the session, I asked who would be interested in doing an in-depth study, a book study, and we're looking at a book called No Better, Do Better, and also a book called Sounding Out the Sight Words. And I would say at least one from every grade level is going to continue with an in-depth study of the science of reading.  And we will continue working and learning more about how the brain learns to read so we're really excited. The teachers were.  after the presentation were a little bit flabbergasted, not just like, they're like, wow, you know, some of the things that they've been feeling for so long were validated. And I think we can maybe start to throw out some of the things that we knew weren't exactly working in our favor. So we're excited about moving forward at Stony Point.",

    "text": " Thanks, Maureen. I'm Seth. I am the principal at Baker Butler, and I really appreciate the time to speak tonight about what our school is doing for the science of reading. Ms. Peterson, our assistant principal, and myself worked closely with Ms. Sims over the last several months to look at what we can do to shore up our reading program, knowing that our students were coming back from the last 18 months with COVID with likely gaps in literacy. And what we found is by  By diving into the science of reading, we discovered that a lot of things we were doing in our reading instruction program, outside of being a reader, may have effectively taught a certain number of students how to read, but not was effective for most students for how to read. So research really did change about how we looked at reading instruction and all the grade levels.  And one good example of that would be normally in the younger years we're teaching students sight words and using context clues and picture clues, as you learn how to read a story and the components of a story, and then as students get older we focus on language comprehension, background knowledge of vocabulary and literacy knowledge and genre.  And what we're finding is the word recognition skills, which is your phonological awareness, knowing those 44 sounds that you just learned about, and your decoding, is equally as important as those language comprehension skills. And unless you have both, you're not going to have a strong reader. So that kind of made us look at how we're teaching reading in a little bit of a different way. And kind of like Maureen was saying, when we presented this to staff, we started the summer off by doing a number of podcasts for our staff on the science of reading, which went into different episodes of this.  Ms. Peterson and I picked out a couple for our staff to listen to. When we finally got together with our literacy team in our school, and we were going over the data with them and the research, there was that moment of awe, like Maureen was mentioning. And our teachers were saying, you know, I have not been teaching reading this way. And there was that guilt of being a teacher wanting to do the right thing. And what we're saying as professionals, we follow the research, we follow the science, and if we learn how to do our jobs better, that's what we're going to do. So really excited about the Being a Reader program, excited about taking some of the concepts  within that program and applying them in fourth and fifth grade. So even though we don't have being a reader in those grade levels, we do know that those students also need those skills for word recognition and phonological awareness and to learn those different sounds, those 44 sounds to be effective readers. So now within those classrooms, we also have those sounds posted and those are being explicitly taught to our students who have not gotten those foundational skills yet. So this has changed in a way that we're not only teaching our tier one students and  in grades, you know, K through three, but also how we're intervening with our students who are behind level in reading to ensure that we're giving that foundation students need as they improve the literacy skills as they go through our program. So we're really excited about this work. This is exciting. This is a multi-year work. And as Maureen mentioned, we find literacy to be a huge equity issue. Ms. Pierce and I got our CRT certifications last year,  and teaching a child how to read is probably one of the most powerful things that we can do as CRT educators. So we're passionate about this work and you know Miss Gere is a huge champion of being a reader at Baker Butler so we're excited she's here tonight. So thank you.",

We're also working to ensure families have access to the TJACE classes at PVCC in the event the adult ESOL classes fill up. And then we're really excited to be talking to families about reading together at home in any language, because we know that the decoding based approach that being a reader uses is the same way that students acquire language in any language. And so we know that by reading in their native language, families will be able to further that symbol sound correspondence together.",

So I guess tied a little bit to Judy's question about what are the results. Are there other things that we, are there other things we should be looking at doing? Because this was a very informative presentation, but we're also on board with it. So what's like the next step?  So I guess a follow-up would be that as great as a program is, it kind of depends how the teachers implement it. So the principal mentioned that this was a priority that she was making it in her school. Is it dependent on leadership kind of embracing it and really giving their teachers time to... Thank you for typing this as I'm talking extensively with multiple questions. So, you know, how do we make sure it's uniformly  applied because Seth I know that your school had great results last year, but that wasn't representative of all our schools, even though we were using ostensibly using being a reader and all of them are in a lot of them. And then.  One point that I could bring up kind of is like, I think a lot can happen in a classroom based on what the teacher decides to do with the program or not. Like the book that I, the learning for all, which I read, it got sent to me in the mail. Thank you, Matt. You know, it talked a lot about grouping of kids and things with that. So I guess just follow up questions on like, what does this look like? This was a high level. What is the program we need to teach phonics? I agree with that. Happy we have being a reader.  how do we get what we want? And one last question, because the SOL results just came out, I don't think they're necessarily fully indicative of what's going on, because last year was a really weird year, but there's an article already out about how the reading scores actually, we outperformed the state, but Charlottesville did not. And I'm kind of curious what are our surrounding areas doing, not that that needs to necessarily inform what we're doing,",

And kind of to address our next steps, I think it's important that we definitely have ongoing PD that really helps teachers understand  how students develop as readers and when they're not developing what what do we do what are our next steps, so I think being a reader is a great entry point, but it's not, we just don't stop there. It's continued professional development I think is very important. And then, what does this look like in the classroom.  from being a reader, there are some look fors that they have given us. And I think how do we hold teachers and schools accountable is that the principals when they're doing their walkthroughs, they use those look fors to then have conversations with teachers about what's going on with their instruction.",

We're really focused on the professional learning community process this year, the PLC meetings, at which point we're going to be reviewing student data for being a reader, which requires ongoing assessments for leveling of students within the program to know when to move up to different levels. So we'll be able to tell not only from walkthroughs and observations, but also to the PLC meetings, which happen each week as to what lessons are being conducted and how students are doing, can watch that progress.

So that would be an important question for me, like we have a plan, which it sounds like we plan to hold them, make sure they're using the program with fidelity, but what does that mean?  You gave a pretty good answer so that's important to me. I'm one last question I had because I listened to it and I feel like I must call out that my son's teacher is in this presentation, and she is being a reading, being a reader with him this Mullen x is good to see you. Although it's multi ages also Miss McKenzie I need to give Miss McKenzie here do.  But listening to that presentation was informative for me because I'm not a teacher. I was, but I'm not a reading specialist by any means. And so I was learning things. So how do we do outreach to parents? Because I have definitely, I mean, the being Bob, Bob Reader's books, which every parent has is picture-based, repetitive. You can figure it out whether you can read the words or not. And that's like a gold standard that I was using. So here's an involved parent who wants to teach your kid and I'm, you know,  I'm not helping, so, or maybe I am, I don't know, but how do we help parents learn this strategy since a lot of the younger grade reading has a lot of parental involvement?",

And I think it's important because that goes hand in hand with our family partnerships when we think about CRT work. So when you're having those parent conversations or student-led conferences, that's a way for parents, one, to know the teacher side, but then also, two, to see when the student's doing the student-led conference.  how that's actualized. So I think we just need to do a better job of being able to send that information out to parents and then seeing it in action in our student-led conferences is probably one way, maybe one of the better ways for parents to see and fully understand how reading is being taught now. Just like in that video that we showed you, it's very different from the way many of us learn how to read. So I think they have to read it and understand it, but then also be able to see it.",

You know 100% may not be seem attainable, but one of the things that did jump out at me from Sarah means presentation when she said that 95%.  of students in our schools are cognitively able to be on grade level with their reading by third grade. So I think that should be the target, you know, 95 to 100% being on grade level. And I just think that makes sense for a lot of reasons, not only because it can be done, but because you can see that as I've talked to the leadership team,  it ends up being a big opportunity gap for our students, because the data on students earning advanced studies diplomas in high school matches up pretty closely to the data, you know, the predictive value of the data of our reading attainment in third grade. And I realized, measured by SOL testing, which  apparently is not as robust as the NAEP assessments. However, those do line up. So I think we've got to strive for 100% understanding that 95% with the research could do it. Yeah, I really appreciate an aggressive goal on that.  We've never had a goal on that. And so I think setting a target and putting all of our effort behind it is going to pay the dividends for the students. And I do know they are working on the dashboard and should have a mock-up. And what I'd like to do is pull the equity committee back together to look at it and poke holes in it and give feedback, and then bring it back for the board to look at.",

Because I mean, third grade's a cutoff for a variety of reasons. That's when reading starts to be used to assess other subject matters, the brain development, but also there's still a lot of reading being taught after third grade and on. And hopefully we have researched back effective methods.

And then we talked about how we ourselves, many of us learn to read in ways that created maybe not as strong readers. And so how can we as parents, how can the school division reach out to parents who are doing our level best to help our kids learn to read, but maybe don't have the skills and information about the science of reading in order to do that?

And, you know, we did talk about one of the things that I was surprised about during the earlier presentation of Sarah's. I'd never heard of the concept of the fourth grade slump before but oh boy does that make sense. And I do remember in Mrs Bachman's class in fourth grade that.  The picture, not only did pictures, but sketches and drawings all went away. And I definitely remember noticing that. Along the lines of what you were talking about, Judy, with the goals, the only thing that we added on and may have been more me added on was  I think it's important for us to have benchmarks to get to that point, because of the 95% of cognitively capable of reading, so whether that and I use the example of five years and I'm just making up that number.  But do we want to get to that point 95% or 100% in five years so that the board has numbers that we can be looking at every year to see what progress has been made and are we on track for that?  And Dr. McLaughlin stepped in and said that in the new report, annual report, state of the division, that those numbers are going to be provided, specifically on this, related to this goal, which I think is great. Kimberly, Ms. Geer said, shared with us,  about during the COVID year and the challenges and successes of teaching reading and teaching your kids to read both in on virtual and then back in the classroom and about how just  Now, this is my word, not Ms. Geer's, but exuberant they were about being back in school and how devastated they were to be leaving for summer break, because I think you used the phrase, they were like sponges. They just wanted to be taking everything in. One question that has nothing to do with this, but what does SIPS stand for? What's the...  acronym mean, please. Does anybody know that off the top of your head?",

I mean, I thought both the presentation by Sarah talking about the principles needing to be literacy champions, and then what Seth Kennard said in his presentation that literacy  is a huge equity issue. My questions focused on what can we do even beyond the classroom in terms of the materials we send home, the teachers we hire, do teachers come out of school knowing about being a reader or making sure that we have all the professional development in place.  and support for parents outside of school and during the summers. We also talked about having the posters or the copies of the phonics sounds for kids to take home. And we also talked about the PD for tutors for young kids. The other area we talked about was  Well, what about our fourth graders or eighth graders who have not learned this? What kind of efforts and commitments do we have beyond K through three, which is the primary focus of this being a reader? And how much remedial work or additional work do we need to do to get those kids on grade level as well?  Yeah, I think that's most of what we talked about. Graham, do you have anything to add?",

So it's that parent family partnership of being able to teach it. And it's something that you could easily do a screencast and then share that out to families of this is what you should be looking for.

We said we wanted to develop an understanding of how ACPS is approaching elimination of team gaps in reading and incorporating the science of reading. And we wanted to deepen the commitment to the strategic plans key strategies. And from the conversation and the jam boards and the reporting out this evening, I think we've accomplished both goals.

And so instead of sending an email around, and I changed my mind Judy because I forgot we were having this meeting tonight.  Next Wednesday, Judy and I are meeting with Rosalind to try and put together a list of ideas for work sessions in the next year and possibly, you know, beyond that.  and so I would ask any and all of the board members if you would please send us your ideas and maybe copy both of us on it so we both are seeing it at the same time and keep the same list for what you would like to see and I know we've talked about this a little bit in the past and Kate you and I have talked about these a number of times  But if you could just kind of start it from scratch and just send us your ideas before next, let's say the end of next Tuesday, because we meet on Wednesday, that sure would be great.
