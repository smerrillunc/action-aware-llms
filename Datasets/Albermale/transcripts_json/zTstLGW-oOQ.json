The school board wishes, excuse me, the school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. The school board wishes to maintain appropriate meeting decorum so that persons can observe and hear the proceedings of the school board and that attendees online are not subject to inappropriate language and conduct.  As my son I'm sorry is crying in the background, you know, he waited until it was my moment to speak and and this is when he's doing it so if you hear him. It is all right, my husband's dealing with it. As authorized by ordinance of the county of Albemarle the school board will hold its meetings.  electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting, and they will be given to all the school board members for review.  And as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the school board meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting.  Before electronic public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order in which your speakers will comment. I'm actually going to, there's 11 speakers, so I'll just announce the first three. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it's that speaker's turn to provide comment to the members of the school board. Speakers are going to be notified when they reach the two minute mark and at the three minute mark. It is me doing the notification and it's generally just me waving when you're at the one minute mark and then waving when it's time to stop.  Speakers during the meeting are those submitting written comments should state their name, address, or magisterial district. Further, speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operations of the school division. And lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And with that, the first speaker, one second.  is going to be Jen T.W., the second speaker is going to be Jeff Handler, and the third speaker is going to be Tara Ilgner. So Jen, if you are on, it is your turn.",

I wanna start by thanking all staff and families for the time, patience, hard work and flexibility. Our two sons are in elementary school, pre-K and second grade for the virtual start. I appreciate the thoughtfulness, attention to detail and concern that their teachers and schools have shown.  Our family also appreciates the cafeteria and bus staffs for daily meals via buses daily. The learning materials available that we pick up also help supplement and add to their seesaw learning and Zoom class meetings. Our family is finding what works for us and we're excited to keep learning and engaging with teachers and classmates. I'm also an educator for Albemarle County Public Schools. This is my 14th year with Albemarle County. I'm a collaborative high school special education teacher.  I just wanted to share that my two different co-teachers and I have been forming great relationships already with students and families. Our Zoom classes are also successful and engaging. The attention to detail and creativity is evident.  I've even had a new student, a ninth grader, call me on the phone to share a piece of work that she was proud of for another class. This is one week after meeting me. It just made me happy that she felt safe and interested to call me. But now I just want to share my concerns and fears for moving into phase three prematurely. And this kind of reminds me of my son's assignment about the power of yet.  It's concerning to hear news of educators of varying ages who are not only becoming exposed or sick, but dying. College campuses, even in our own community, are places with increasing positive COVID cases and exposures. I feel that acting hastily and reopening before it's safe to do so, and there's a vaccine available, will push things back negatively. We should wait to vote on moving up in phases when it is safe to do so and cases are not steadily rising in our community and state.  Teachers and staff has spent time doing extra PD to prepare to be more successful virtually and to get families and get more familiar with a variety of technology and online resources. Students and families are being asked for feedback so that changes and modifications can be made to make future lessons better and more engaging. We're putting extra time and energy to make this virtual start work. I wanna close with the reminder that we're all in this together. Thank you.",

    "text": " Hi, good evening. Um, so I'm a citizen of Charlottesville resident Charlottesville, and, but I just had a question about the HMSA and the Mesa special education programs through Albemarle school.  I understand that city children are not eligible for consideration for these Albemarle school academies. And I just wanted to understand why. I didn't realize this wouldn't be a question answer sort of situation so I'll just throw all my questions out there and you guys get to them as you can. But my questions are this.  So I understand there may have been segregationist policies in the past that kept downtown Charlottesville away from the Albemarle schools, but is that still the policy? And if that's not the real reason why Charlottesville city kids can't petition or apply to attend Albemarle schools, is it because their families are not contributing taxes, in which case, why is tuition not an option?  If the issue is that there are too many kids in Albemarle, wouldn't the application process allow the academies to regulate their size? So I'm just not sure I understand whether it's a size of the class issue or a funding or tax issue or segregationist issue. I just don't know what the reason is for keeping that.  completely inaccessible to city kids. So my kids are residents of Charlottesville, as I said. I work at UVA in the Earth Sciences Department.  I'm in graduate school for atmospheric chemistry. My kids are bright, but there are also lots of other kids here in the city who would, underprivileged children who would really benefit from this option. So basically what I'm asking is, is this separation necessary or just by preference? That's all.",

    "text": "Thank you, school board, for doing what you do, volunteering a massive amount of time and energy. And I'm sure every time you go anywhere, everybody's on you. We all know that we have confirmed cases.  here the first weeks of phase two, right here in Elmira County. We all know the cases in Virginia are on the rise due to one big factor being UVA. Why would anyone even consider putting children's lives, their families, educational staff lives on the line when we know it's dangerous to do so?  By the way, I teach at Albemarle High School in special education and government. I want to read what a senior wrote to me today, and he gave me permission for me to share it with you tonight because it was too late for him to get on. This is from Josh Francisco to everyone.  about opening up schools before any form of effective medical advancement for the purpose of combating COVID would lead to nothing but disaster and is a move that is begging to get everyone infected. The concept of herd immunity is also worrying because not only is COVID an extremely painful experience, as testified by my friend in Italy,  that actually currently has it. But also, you're not guaranteed to survive. My father, who is a nurse, has told me a true story here in UVA that a woman had COVID once before and is now recovering for the second time. And he specifically says, I'm not too fond of the idea of dying, coming close to dying, or being afflicted by something that is extremely painful. I don't think anybody else wants that either.  I'm, I asked you as a member as to really carefully look at what the Elmira Educational Association has laid out. These are my words, not his now. Measurable, reliable benchmarks that can guide the school board in deciding when to move between phases.  It's not OK for all this responsibility to be sitting in your lap. And I saw it on different times. You're saying, oh, should I open? Should I not open? Well, my goodness. You laid out exactly what each phase looks like. But it can't be just like nine weeks. And then it's going to magically disappear. An arbitrary nine weeks in one phase, then go to the next is not acceptable. You need to use science and data and look at the experts.  I can only see that that's the way we could move forward, and it would help you to say you know if you don't like what lmr was laid out, and they're very specific. The Education Association on, and it seems like you have.  Um, but make your own and make it clean and make it with CDC guidelines and, you know, and they've done that. So I just ask that you would really highly look at that. And by the way, I am teaching it at Elmorrow high school and, and it's, it is really working. I don't know how it works in the elementary, but I know we have more kids attending than before.",

    "text": " Yes, ma'am, thank you. I appreciate the time this evening to chat with y'all. I gotta give my hats off to everybody in Amarillo County, public schools, all the staff, and everybody, the teachers that are making this work. We've got two kids, we've got a child at Baker Butler, another one at Jack Jewett, and it's been fantastic. As far as with as much, the minimal amount of resources y'all have gotten, and to be able to make it work as well as you could.  Our first grader, you know, he's having a tougher time. He just loves being in school with friends and stuff. But, you know, we balance that with being in the emergency department and things are still tough. Supply lines, they haven't really bolstered them at a federal level. So we're not any better off. I don't know a single hospital of any of my colleagues that work at, they're back to single use PPE, you know, appropriate mask supplies and things like that. In the Charlottesville area, it's been,  Last week, I think the university emergency department effectively shut down for half a day they went on divert because they were so busy they couldn't take any more patients which obviously. there's only two hospitals in our area, so people have to go somewhere but, and that is with we had a surge in July and August, and it was it was not a fun time and so we're off of that, but obviously with the weather changing.  You know, we don't know what's going to happen. There's a flu outbreak I was reading in San Francisco today we were hoping we might escape that the southern hemisphere largely did but  That's a gamble we have to take. Whatever you decide, we just need to take all that into consideration and that the fact that the virus seems to be spread primarily through the air by airborne vectors. I don't know that I've seen a confirmed, I don't know that I've personally seen a confirmed case of like an outdoor transmission. I'm not saying that's not possible, clearly, but people are outdoors and away from each other, you get a lot of ventilation, it's a lot safer and it's a lot harder to do as we go forward.  I'm not just to make sure that whatever you decide to do that you're keeping all of that in consideration, because if we have to hit the brakes again and we should probably have a plan to do that. By the time we do hit the brakes, you know it takes two or three weeks.  to slow down if that makes sense and catch up. And, you know, it's the emergency services folks that are gonna be sort of the brakes for that. So, you know, we're coming at it from two ways, both as a family that works in emergency services and with kids that we'd like to get back in school. So it's tough. And if you guys just make sure you take that into consideration as you go forward. Thank you.",

I graduated from college and came to work for Albemarle County and this is my thirty first year. That being said, I am all in Albemarle County. That being said, I am in that age group where  COVID is something that worries me. I am in that medical group where my doctors filled out all my ADA forms and I cannot return to a building. This virtual start has been amazing. I don't know many teachers that won't tell you that this has gone better than we ever thought it could.  And that doesn't mean that we haven't had technology problems and Wi-Fi problems and problems. But the bond that I have already built with my children, I can't imagine in November losing the ones that go back into the building. I can't imagine that. And I don't think it will be good for them either because  We've bonded under these pandemic circumstances and we're important to each other and we're learning and we're learning together and we're having fun. I know these parents at three weeks better than I have ever in years because they're sitting beside their kids, because they're walking behind their kids, because they're checking on their kids, because they're popping into Zooms to say, hey, Ms. Stallings, I need help with  We text, we email, communication couldn't be better. It just couldn't be better. I'm speaking for myself and I know that everybody has a different point of view with that, but the majority of teachers I've heard from, it's been a very positive opening. So I'm asking you to really think about all of those kinds of things about how it's gonna affect the kids  I'm asking you to really think before we move into stage three. And you're welcome anytime to pop into my Zoom class. I think you'd love what these little kids have to say about things. And I appreciate your continued hard work. And maybe I'll see you for 32.",

    "text": "Hi, thank you so very much for having me. My name is Bo Odom. I'm a parent of a first grader at Greer Elementary. So we're in the Jack Jewett neighborhood. And really sincerely, I wanna thank our first grade teacher.  incredible. We think she's fantastic. She's been working incredibly hard. When issues arise on Zoom, she's seeking to pivot to the next best option. She's sweet. She's kind. She's, she noticeably tries to care for each child present on Zoom. I assume she's a lot like Ms. Stallings and, and I would hope you'd all look, look up Archer's first grade teacher and give her a raise and give all these teachers a raise. But I, but I do want to say that, well, we have a first grader and I can only speak to that experience.  But I think it's really imperative that you know what that experience is. And I believe Ms. Stongs when she says that it has been a good enriching experience for the children and they have a bonded relationship. But I would argue that this experience is not working for my first grader. I don't believe students are learning. Our daughter is not learning. I believe it's enrichment. I'd urge you to visit any first grade Zoom class. It's a bit of pandemonium.  Distractions abound, and we knew that was gonna be an issue, but distractions compound with little attention first graders can dedicate to YouTube videos and whiteboards that are unfocused, and nine different other students continuously unmuting and forgetting to re-mute, and continuous background noises they add to the cacophony. And even if one student is overeager, they end up dominating the questions that are asked to the general class.  answering the question before my daughter has an opportunity. And I want to be real. I mean, these are first graders. These are first graders. We shouldn't expect the kind of self-control that is necessary for an online format. I just want to say that I don't believe my daughter is receiving the attention that's necessary for learning at this age. I echo again how marvelous I think my daughter's teacher is. But the experiences in education, I would say it's enrichment. Yes, she's learning social cues. She knows  What a mute button is, and she's getting ever so personal look at the range of privilege in this world. And I'm really, really grateful for those things. I know that we have an incredible amount of privilege in our household. We have good internet. We have a quiet place to retreat. We have two parents with flexible schedules who can be one of those parents in the background. But I can't even imagine what this experience would be for those without the privilege that we have.  But in reading and math and particularly in writing, my daughter needs so much help. She's already tested and placed in remedial help in kindergarten. This is not a format of education for first grade. And it seems that the education that's necessary is simply impossible over Zoom. They are learning to enjoy and appreciate, but they're not practicing any skill building, the skill building that's necessary.  Thank you so very much for taking my comments.",

    "text": " So hi, my name is Catherine Deatley and I teach kindergarten at Meriwether Lewis. And like many of the teachers in the county, I want nothing more than to go back to the classroom and be with my students. But I only want that when it is safe for everyone. When I read an AEA email stating the county was planning on proposing we go to phase three in November, my anxiety levels immediately went through the roof.  The three main reasons for this anxiety are health, choice, and student impact. As an asthmatic, the idea of going back in a person during a global pandemic that involves a respiratory illness scares me. And as much as I want to see my students and my colleagues, the fear of possibly coming into contact with someone who unknowingly has COVID is real for any teacher, staff member, and student that is considered high risk. This leads me to my second reason for the anxiety, the choice I may have to make.  If the rumor mill is true, then teachers will be given a choice to either go face-to-face or stay virtual. If we go face-to-face, we get to keep our class. If we remain virtual, then we lose our class. We lose our students that we have spent weeks getting to know and have built relationships, bonds, and trust with.  I love and adore my students. And while virtual learning is not the ideal situation, we are making it work the best that we can. My students continue to amaze me every day with their resilience, persistence, kindness, and patience. And yes, there have been a few bumps here and there, but we are able to push on because we know that we are in this together. We continue to learn through singing, movement, discussion, art, games, play, and exploration. My kids are even  writing at this point. All approaches that we are using are developmentally appropriate. And lastly, I have extreme anxiety over the learning experience my students will have if we go back face to face too soon. Research will tell you that our youngest learners learn best through play, movement, music, interaction, and hands-on exploration.  If we go back face-to-face where we have to follow strict safety measures, the majority of what we know to be developmentally appropriate will be unusable. Instead, it will be replaced with our students trying to sit in a desk for the majority of their school day, six feet from the friends that they just wanna play with, looking at the toys that they can't play with. There will be no group exploration of dirt or games of chase on the playground. If we aren't able to teach our students in the best way we know how, just so they can stay safe,  then what kind of education are we truly providing them with? And to ACPS, what is more important, keeping everyone safe while providing a developmentally appropriate education or simply putting warm bodies in a building where they will receive a mediocre education and run the risk of getting sick? Please fight for us and do what is right for everybody. Thank you for your time. And Katrina, thank you for saying my last name correctly.",

    "text": " All right, well, in that case, I am going to go ahead and start my time. My name is Maggie Johnson. I am the German one and two teacher at Monticello High School here in Albemarle County. I live in Charlottesville City, but I teach in the county and I'm proud to. I'd like to first make it clear that my comments represent exclusively my own perspective and my own concerns. I do not claim to speak for any other teachers or any other staff or faculty in the county.  I think it goes without saying that this virtual school year is not our ideal. I miss seeing my students. I am only in my second year of teaching, but I already have grown to love being in a physical classroom and being around students, and I miss them. And I miss the spontaneity of in-person teaching, and I miss being able to create a physical space to let my students learn and grow as people and within the boundaries of the language that I teach.  But even considering the shortcomings of virtual education, the fact of the matter is that it is not safe for in-person instruction, even on a hybrid level, and it will not be safe to return to in-person instruction until there is an effective and accessible vaccine available. Put plainly, if we return to in-person schooling, even on a hybrid schedule, people will become sick with COVID-19,  and people will die of COVID-19 as a direct result of that decision. Instead of worrying about when and how to return to in-person instruction, I think that the school board and the county as a whole need to focus on how to facilitate the best possible online instruction.  The questions of when and how to return to in-person classes should not even be considered until the CDC approves distribution of a vaccine, and that vaccine is made accessible to every person. Instead, I would like for the school board to focus their efforts solely on supporting teachers, staff, students, and families in the district with online education.  I genuinely believe that if we accept that this is our reality for the foreseeable future, instead of deluding ourselves with thinking we can return to in-person or hybrid for the 2020-21 year, we can learn powerful lessons as a county and as individuals to take into our instruction when it is safe. To emphasize that point to the minute I have left, I'd like to offer some improvements that I've already begun to see in my planning and teaching, even in these first three weeks of classes.  Being limited to 45 minutes of direct synchronous instruction at the high school level means that I am making more deliberate intentional decisions about what, when, and how to teach material. This is allowing me to explore a flipped approach to my classes in which students take notes on grammatical structures or learn vocabulary asynchronously. And we then practice during synchronous classes. I am also able to focus more closely on students achieving proficiency and understanding with the material instead of feeling pressured to assign record graded exercises or assignments.  The online format further means that I can explore new programs and technologies to incorporate into class, such as Flipgrid or Edpuzzle, which I've already started to use Flipgrid in my classes to make learning more engaging and more accessible to every student. When the day comes that it's safe to return to in-person, I'll be able to use these technologies as part of my standard curriculum because I'll have had plenty of experience using them in a variety of ways. That's all of the time that I have, but I have submitted comments via email to the school board that I would like for you to please review  when you're considering the next steps for the county. Thank you.",

And I just wanted to ask a few questions and hopefully raise a few points about moving to a potentially hybrid situation. And  Right now, teachers are working really hard as they have been and as they tend to always do. And we've spent about a month with students and about two months planning. And we are still, you know, trying to make sure that we are doing everything we can and covering all of our bases without overtaxing the students. I'm worried that moving to a hybrid plan this soon while students are still figuring out how to handle  Um, the, the virtual plan would only confuse things even more. And I just wanted to make sure we have a few things like hammered out before we actually move into a hybrid plan. And some things that I wanted to be aware of, um, will we prepare the schools, um, it to be disinfected and clean, or is that something a teacher is going to have to do? Um, is there going to be increased air ventilation in the classrooms, which already have, um, poor ventilation as it is.  Are there going to be more resources and structures for the teachers to handle doing an online class as well as an in-person class? Because there's a lot of, a lot of our resources right now are already being stretched to the capacity, doing what we're doing as it is. So trying to do both seems like asking a lot. Are there going to be ways to ensure that students are actually abiding by the health protocols and not putting other people at risk?  Will there be compensation for teachers who have children who are also in the hybrid plan and they can't leave their children at home? And will there be compensation for teachers who have to come in to a hybrid plan and put themselves at risk if their colleagues can't come in? And I don't mean to sound accusatory. I don't mean to sound antagonistic. I just want to make sure that we've considered a lot of these things that need to happen before we can safely move into a hybrid plan.  Thank you for your time. I really appreciate the work that you guys are putting into this and for hearing us out because this is tense and this is scary and this is hard. And so I appreciate it. I yield my time.",

At the last school board meeting, I raised my concerns that the five stages of return to school had no health criteria associated with them. Without these criteria, there's no context. At the beginning of each meeting you all have, the school board meeting, you all discuss to some great degree the various statistics and data regarding COVID-19 in the health district.  Without the context of criteria for each of the return to school stages, this is all meaningless. It's mere theater. Clearly, the school board has decided it's safer for some students to return to school and also for the children of teachers and staff to return for childcare at the schools. So of course, there must have been some health standards  for them to return to the school that the school board hasn't released. I'm requesting again that you somehow come up with criteria for each stage of return to school and publish it so that we can know how close or far away we are from being able to return to in-school learning, which I think we all agree is best for the students.

I'm a teacher.  at Mountain View Elementary School. I'm in the Scottsville District along with my two kids. And I know you've heard a little bit, but I do want to reiterate that things are going really well. I have a first grader, and I just did want to respond to Bo's comment about skill building. If we were in person, responsive classroom says the first six weeks of school are all about building routine. So I don't think the education his child is receiving is any different than what he would be getting in the building. It takes six weeks to get to know your class, to build routines,  And that's what's happening now. It just looks different and it's on Zoom. And my first grader is having a wonderful time. I really think that it's important that before you vote, that I really think every school board member should attend meetings with the staffs at the schools that you represent. I appreciate Ellen and Graham are already going to be coming to Mountain View along with Dr. Haas.  and anyone else that wants to, I think hearing from the teachers is crucial. And unless you really make that transparent, I think that you're missing out on a huge piece of information that teachers can provide. We can let you know how things are going. We can let you know what in-person looks like at current status. We can talk about how we've problem solved and we can talk about how well things are going. And we can also, you will find out soon how many teachers will not be returning in person until it's safe.  I think you need to know that before voting. I also think that it's really important that transparency in the medical and in the teacher capacity is really evident before voting.  Um, I also want to say that as in the same way that our school system when we have a snow day, sort of, even though some schools might have totally fine roads nearby and you're thinking man why do we have a snow day these roads are fine but we've got those dirt roads way out in the county and it's not safe for them.  By the same token, I see one more minute. By the same token, at some schools that are much smaller, maybe they feel much more equipped to take on phase three. At my school, that would be 470 students would be eligible to come in for phase three. And that's just not sustainable. Right now we have 15. So to go from 15 to 470,  Potential students is just, that's really a hard pill to swallow, and I don't know how we would do that. So I really think that getting to know your schools and really figuring out what each phase looks like is really important. So that's all. I really feel strongly that you know that phase two is going well, and the biggest complaint I hear is the schedule, and I have some solutions to that if you'd like to hear them, but that's all I have to say. Thanks.",

    "text": "Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Page. So I just have a great announcement to make. It's really exciting.  Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Education announced their National Blue Ribbon Awards for Excellence in Academic Performance. For the first time in the program's 38-year history, a Virginia school has received the department's Exemplary Award for Closing Achievement Gaps. I'm proud to say that our own Baker Butler is one of four schools in our state to meet the very high standards for this recognition.  In fact, of the 1,800 schools in Virginia, only 58 even qualified in this category. The award covers three school years beginning with 2016-17. Over this time period, SOL pass rates for English language learners, special education students, and students from economically disadvantaged homes increased by 87% for math and 78% in reading.  Yes, those are increases, not the pass rate. This far exceeded the increase in overall pass rates of 15% in math and 11% in reading in Virginia. As a result, the achievement gap in reading was reduced from 24 down to 11 percentage points, and the gap in math fell from 16 percentage points to six.  These achievements will be featured in our spotlight on education during our October the 8th meeting, but I would like to congratulate the outstanding and remarkably talented faculty, staff, students, families, and of course, previous principal Steve Saunders and current principal Seth Kennard for your outstanding work. This is a nationally renowned accomplishment.  And as impressive as these numbers are, I know the school's motto will be the best is yet to come. Thank you.",

So we do have this letter that we'll be sending out to Miss Burkhardt, along with a certificate that's worthy to be framed. And we really appreciate what Milani has done as our first representative on the school board as a student.  So the letter says, Dear Melanie, in a year unlike any other in our school division's history, there have been several firsts, and one of them has been your service as our student representative to the school board. In establishing this role, our goal was to enhance the quality and effectiveness of decisions that directly impact students and their futures. We especially wanted to provide a direct link with students.  You were that link. We especially valued your insight and counsel on such important decisions as the banning of hate images in schools, providing a safe and welcoming learning environment for all students, and the classroom challenges presented by the pandemic.  In our policy, we said we wanted a student representative of exemplary character with high personal standards of conduct, a student who modeled the fulfillment of school policies and regulations, and a leader interested in school board governance. And Melanie, you earned straight A's in all of those categories. Thank you for setting such a high standard for all who will succeed you.  It was a pleasure to serve with you. Best wishes for a highly successful year at Monticello High and in all of your future endeavors. Stay safe. So, Malani, do you have any comments that you would like to give to us here at this time?",

Both Ryan and Eileen are incredibly well-versed in how COVID-19 is impacting our region, and they look forward to sharing their expertise with you tonight. As you recall, our return to school plan outlined multiple factors that we'll use to determine  when we move forward with our next stage. Per your request, at each board meeting, we'll provide updates in regard to one of these factors, the current COVID-19 conditions in Albemarle County.  All data that you see tonight has been provided by the Virginia Department of Health. And it's important to note that these statistics and trend data are one factor in determining the move forward or back in our return to school stages. It's recommended that the board continue to look at all factors collectively as these decisions are made.

    "text": " Good evening. Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin. I'm Eileen Gomez. I am the school nurse coordinator and the COVID coordinator this year for Albemarle County Public Schools. And I would like to take you through the latest updates on the metrics that we have gotten from the Virginia Department of Health. As you can see, this first slide is the seven day floating average of the number of cases per 100,000 people.  and see that the numbers have, well, they call this trend fluctuating, but the numbers are lower now than they were in the end of August. And overall, we've been seeing a downward trend with the case burden or the floating average of the cases.  The percent positivity rate for testing in Elmar County has been steadily going down. You can see we're down at 3.6%, which is one of the lowest rates we've had at least all summer. That has been decreasing. Now in the city of Charlottesville, it's a little bit different. We have been on an upward trend of number of cases.  Some of that can be, I think most of the increase can be attributed to UVA cases. But we wanted to explain that the metrics we received from the Virginia Department of Health are intended to provide a starting point for conversations and decision making. We do not have absolute benchmarks for which people are clamoring.  It is, we believe it's important to contextualize the data. For example, UVA does have an impact on the case counts in the city, but not so much on the county. Luckily, we have Ryan McKay with us this evening, and he can help explain some of this data and put it into some context and may be able to answer any questions you have.",

    "text": "Ryan?  Thank you, Eileen, appreciate that. So, again, my name is Ryan McKay, senior policy analyst for the Thomas Jefferson Health District. And one of the things that we've been looking at closely throughout the pandemic are a lot of the numbers as they relate to positivity rates, the raw data of case counts, and certainly the cases per 100,000, both on a daily basis, but over the course of a 14 day period of time. And I think Eileen hits the point very well in terms of context.  what goes into these numbers, what goes into the seven-day positivity trend of 3.6. There are a number of factors that we have to consider when it comes to decision-making, whether it's for schools bringing students back or implementing community-wide mitigation strategies that the Board of Supervisors implemented back in late July and early August.  So part of that is understanding where we've been doing testing and where the positive results come from. If we do a point prevalence survey in let's say a long term care facility or at the regional jail.  One of the things that we would look for are the total number of positives related to those. Those will drive up many of the numbers in our localities. For example, Fluvanna County was at about 3.2 to 3.4% just over a week ago, and now they're up over 7.4% positivity rate over the last seven days. We can attribute that to one event in the outbreak at the Fluvanna Correctional Facility for Women.  Similarly, we can identify increases based on relationships with the university and student transmission there. While we haven't really seen the huge uptick within the county, we can attribute some of the cases and the case incidence rate 100,000 to students who live in the county or cases that are attributable to UVA in general.  And so I think it's really important to understand what the background is to some of these testing rates. The other is, and I think it might be a little confusing, sometimes is with the UVA, I'm sorry, the Charlottesville numbers, you notice that they're in bright red. It's at 48 per 100,000, but the positivity rate is below 5%, which is ideal for what we need to do as public health.  What that tells us is there's massive amounts of testing going on, and that's not just limited to UVA testing students and faculty. That goes to community testing that's happening throughout Albemarle County and Charlottesville and throughout the health district on a daily and weekly basis.  The more we test, the greater access that we provide to that testing, and the more frequently we do that, the idea is that we want to find those cases. We want to make sure that we can isolate individuals who test positive, that we can identify their close contacts, those who are within six feet for more than 15 minutes at a time, who may need to quarantine and monitor for symptoms themselves.  And that's really critical, because from our perspective, we want to make contact with those individuals within 24 hours. The more we can do that, the more likely it is that we can contain, not just mitigate. Difference being mitigation slows the spread, containing stops it. From our perspective, one of the important data points that isn't necessarily publicly released is our ability to do that within 24 hours. And we feel pretty confident that we can do that consistently at or above the 95% rate.  So I think the context behind the data is important. And as Eileen mentioned, it's a starting point for a broader discussion to determine what the risk may be. We heard often tonight about safe. And I think that's really hard to define. What we can better define is potential risk involved. And what are we doing, not just in relation to the positivity rates and the case counts,  But what are we doing holistically as a community to mitigate and minimize risk? It goes to wearing the face masks, physically distancing, doing symptom checks as a whole system as opposed to just focusing on what the percent positivities are.  We have examples within our health district and within the state of schools that have opened at varying levels of positivity rates, at varying levels of cases per 100,000. And I think what it's important is to, yes, look at those data points as a part of the conversation, but also understand what the ability is of a school system to implement the strategies that are going to reduce and minimize risk to the greatest extent possible.  So with that, I'm happy to answer questions about the data, about indicators, and any other questions you have about COVID-19 from the public health perspective.",

It wouldn't be at a current, with the current number of outbreaks or the current number of cases within a school that occurred associated with that outbreak. But we will be able to at least show the cumulative number of outbreaks on our public facing dashboard.  I think the other part of that is those weekly calls school systems have reported that a case has occurred, based on media reports, they've been asked to share details in terms of how was the process to identify close contacts.  what were the lessons learned from those experiences. And then we can also share about process and procedure and protocol so that other school systems can learn from those responses to those individual cases and then make adjustments accordingly based on their own plans. So that's been a pretty informative piece that the qualitative part of all of this is also just as important as the quantitative.",

But the impact of UVA coming back to grounds has been less impactful on the county than it has been on the city.

We use that as an opportunity to  potentially determine different strategies based on the location of those clusters or potential outbreaks. We use them to determine where we may need to identify testing locations and conduct outreach in terms of information and education about COVID, ways to minimize and reduce risk, and certainly minimize spread.  There are zip code level data available through a couple of different sites that can be found. It makes it a little challenging because zip codes in Elmorrow County can range from a zip code that includes a large section of Charlottesville and Elmorrow, but its most granular data, I think, would be publicly available for review.",

    "text": "Of course, yes. I believe there are ways that it can be done, and I've seen it. I visited Louisa County Public Schools about two weeks ago and got a tour of their middle and high school from their superintendent, Doug Straley, who showed me every step of the way of how they have worked to minimize and reduce risk to the extent possible, from the screening procedures that they have  how they do symptom checks and temperature checks, how they have students enter various parts of the building based on grade level, and how they've cohorted students. Now I will say a lot of what's occurred and what we're hearing is that this is pretty common across Virginia.  is that they're able to decompress the number of students who are doing in-person education. So they had about a one-third of parents decide to keep students home for full virtual education, so that left them with two-thirds of their school system attending school in person.  I believe they're on an AB schedule. And so while school doesn't look like school in terms of the numbers and what a classroom looks like, they have been very successful at bringing students back, implementing policies such as face masks, putting markers on the floor, stickers on the floor as reminders of how to do physical and social distancing. Six feet can be sort of  hard to navigate if you're standing in a line without that visual reference. So the strategies they put in at both levels have been pretty remarkable to see. And I'll be honest, I had a hard time getting my head around what a school looks like during COVID and how you can minimize risk to the extent possible. And they've done a tremendous job. And they've also had some strong protocols as it relates to  What happens if we've identified an individual with COVID who's a member of the school community? What do we do in terms of information sharing, contact tracing, and then education following that to ensure that we've identified as public health all the people that may have been a close contact and that we've done everything we can to contain potential spread?  And so they've been a very good example. I know Greene County opened a couple of weeks ago. My understanding is Dr. Hawes talked to Andrea Whitmarsh, their superintendent, and we've heard nothing but good things there. In fact, Greene County visited Louisa County just to get an idea of what was happening. And they've been very open about what didn't necessarily work to begin with and what they've adjusted on the fly to make those operations, again, with low risk or minimizing risk to the extent possible.  I will say it's important to keep in mind that as schools open, whether it's Albemarle County or Charlottesville or anywhere in Virginia,  We have to anticipate there may be a case that emerges, and we have to understand that our response to that is going to impact whether or not we contain spread, mitigate spread, or if spread moves forward. And so that planning process, that constant review of those plans, and learning from others, along with looking at the community data, is going to be an ongoing process. It's evolving.  But again, to reiterate to your original question, yes, I believe it can be done in a way that minimizes risk to the extent possible, as long as there's a sort of a systems approach to that in combination with what we can provide and share through data and context around that data.",

    "text": " Good evening school board members. Thanks Rosalyn for the introduction. So I will jump right into our agenda for today. Our work session will be divided into three sections based on our desired targets. And they are to understand the COVID-19 impacts on the CIP process and current appropriation, to prepare you all for the joint board of supervisors work session that's scheduled for October 21st,  And then finally, to provide guidance to the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee for long-term facilities planning. As you can see, the first part will be for information. I will pause for questions after the first session. And then the second and the third sections really are discussions for you all to discuss amongst each other with staff and the committee members about capital projects.  Before we begin, I want to clarify our multi-year CIP process. This is important, particularly this year, as we will be making more decisions than we would in a typical year about capital projects. The first part of the projects are FY 2020, so that's last fiscal year's carry forward projects. So any previously adopted and appropriated projects  can be carried over if those projects are not complete into the current FY 21 fiscal year. In a typical year that happens automatically if the project isn't finished, but this year you will see that it wasn't completely automatic. Then we have the FY 2021 capital budget. That's the current year we're in. That budget was adopted last spring and funds for that were appropriated. However, there may be  budget amendments in the current year that adjust the budget that was adopted back in the spring based on a better revenue picture that we, not necessarily a better revenue picture, but better revenue information that we will get later this year. Next, we have the FY22 capital budget, which is next year's capital budget. And we plan for that during the budget planning process the year before. So this is the year  that we are planning for next year's capital budget. In addition, we will also be planning for, through FY 2025, we will not be adding a fifth year to our previously adopted five-year capital program, CIP, and instead we will just shift forward a year and plan a four-year CIP. That is the current planning. And then the year after that is the fiscal year 23  and beyond period. This is really what we're calling the long-range planning aspect, and this is what the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee is currently focused on. You may remember that last year we designed a more transparent and streamlined process for the CIP decision-making. We worked very closely with local government and aligned a lot of our meetings and decision points.  It was a very successful budget process, and I'm sure you will see this again during the next budget cycle when we plan for FY23. For planning for FY22 purposes, since it is a CIP amendment year and we're in an unusual year, our process will look quite different, and I'll go over that a little bit later.  different topic areas. The ones that were approved by the, not approved, but recommended in the County Executive's recommended budget are highlighted here in red. So that's the Crozet addition and improvements and the Mountain View expansion and site improvements. And that recommended budget was put forward in February  of 2020, so right before the pandemic. I want to next turn you to an update on where we are with our current budget and appropriation in order to understand the baseline from which we're working from. As you know, our maintenance and replacement program is broken out into three categories. They are school bus facilities and technology,  For school bus replacement, our full remaining balance from last year was carried forward. But as you can see, the FY21 budget has been reduced from what was originally recommended in the February budget, the recommended budget. The main change would just be that the replacement cycle for school buses is now delayed.  we are able to move forward with a couple essential purchases with the amount that was appropriated. For facilities maintenance, the balance that was remaining from the previous year, some of that was cut with only essential projects moving forward. And that same justification was used to reduce the FY21 budget between the recommended and the adopted. As you can see, technology projects  are fully funded at this point. This next list are the one-time CIP projects. The majority of these, as you can see, are FY20 or projects that were previously appropriated. The list that says unfunded, that was the amount that may, in a typical year, be carried forward and reappropriated into the  are able to get more information later in the year.

That project was originally in the recommended budget back in February.  But when the budget was revised for adoption, that project was not included. However, the design for that was already funded.

    "text": "Thank you. So I'm just going to highlight three of those bigger projects just to give you a little more information on them. The first is High School Center 2.  As it was stated in that last slide, the design money for that project was carried forward, but the construction as of this point has not. So that's a decision point that the school board and the Board of Supervisors have to make. And I draw your attention to that because as the schedule that we have outlined for that, we have bidding and construction starting next summer.  And so what that means is that if this part, the construction money for this project does not get added to the FY21 budget, this project would be delayed. The next slide. Similarly, with the Crozet addition, we do have design underway.  Next slide, yeah. Design underway, you will see the design develop, you approve the schematic in July and you'll see the design development portion of that project at your next meeting in October. And as you will see, to keep this project on schedule, we would need to bid and contract in the January, February timeframe of 2021. So again, if the FY21 budget does not get amended to include the construction, which it does not have right now,  this project would also be delayed. And then the third project, I just want to keep on our forefront as well as the Mountain View expansion. So that was originally in the recommended CIP for FY 22. And then when everything was revised, it was taken out. So as you recall in Maya's timeline, decisions for this year are going to affect both 21 and 22. So we want to make sure that this  project doesn't get lost in the shuffle as well. And I share that all knowing that those are very large projects, and we know that revenues will certainly be uncertain and limited. So we have to be realistic about it. But I did want to make sure that we keep all of these projects, in addition to our maintenance and replacement, restoration on our radar.",

    "text": "Thanks, Rosalyn.  I'm going to shift gears a little bit now to student enrollment. These numbers here, I'll go through each column, but the first column is showing our original capacity calculations. We have not adjusted those for K-12. The second column here is showing the September 9th actual enrollment data, which was shared with you earlier this month. The third column is showing the  the original projections for the current year. So what we thought we were going to get in terms of enrollment for this fall. And then the last column is showing the fifth year of those original projections. The purpose of this is to show you that while our enrollment is lower currently than what we anticipated, and it's still fluctuating every day, there are still some schools that are noted in red where the enrollment does exceed the current capacity.  So I'll just give you a minute to look at that. The Red Hill and Scottsville capacities do include the additional space as a result of the current renovations. So looking forward, we have begun the planning process for developing enrollment projections, our 10-year enrollment projections.  We have decided at this time, as you know, we are pushing the entire operating budget process. We're delaying that by about a month for each step of the way. So we are going to mirror that in the enrollment projections. That extra time will buy us more time to collect more data and to really look at our methodology to see what will be most appropriate to move forward with these projections.  I think most importantly, we will be working with a lot of our partners, which we have previously, but there will be a special focus on this year. So that'll be the Weldon Cooper Center, who we've worked with in the past to develop enrollment projections. We will make sure to connect with principals and OAs who know the most what's happening in their schools and their communities. We're gonna do a deep dive with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee about what our methodology will be.  And as always, we will partner closely with the Community Development Department and local gov, and we will turn to industry best practices or as much as they can be developed throughout this fall and winter. We will do a deep analysis by school, by grade level, by feeder patterns to really determine, to really understand what happened this year, and we will do as much data collection as we possibly can.  And then finally, we will. Flex where we are currently and then an upper end that better reflects our status quo where we would have been before the pandemic.  And again, the focus for the range will be that we may use a different set of projections, whether it's for operating resource allocations for the short term, or whether it's facilities planning for the long term. We'll sort of need that wiggle room and that range to really make the best decisions. So that's the first part of  the agenda to understand where we are and what's happening. So I'll pause here for any clarifying questions that you may have.",

We knew that we wouldn't need the construction money anytime soon, so it was paused. And same with the Crozet. And that's why they  we were able to fund the design and not the construction. And the decision at that point was to revisit it midway through FY21. So there is not, has not formally been a decision to delay.

And hopefully the conversations that you have today will better prepare you in having a discussion with the Board of Supervisors that's scheduled in October. In November, the CIP Advisory Committee that was formed last year will convene and make a recommendation to the County Executive for consideration for his recommended budget. And as we've talked about this evening,  Discussion points and decision points will not only include FY22 like it would in a typical year, the FY20 carry forwards, the FY21 amended capital budget if there are amendments, and then in addition to the FY22 capital budget and the four-year CIP following that. So these are all going to be sort of discussed and considered as a whole group, which is a change from previous years.  So we're going to divide up the school board into two smaller groups to make it a little bit easier to communicate with each other. And we'd like to hear some guiding questions for you. What should be our high level focus be for this year's process? So this is thinking short term for FY21 and FY22.  We're hoping that you'll discuss why you think that area of focus is important, or maybe it's that you need more information that we can provide you over the next month. So these are the groups. We have discovered a collaborative tool called Jamboard, and we'll be sharing that link with you. And it's basically a virtual way to have, you know,  a poster with stickies and notes the way you would in a real work session. Hopefully, you will find that interesting. We will have staff in each of the groups to help facilitate if you have any questions. So at that point, I think, Jennifer, we are ready for our groups.",

If it's going to be early capacity, there's an importance to Crozet Elementary and to Mountain View because they're busting at the seams. And so, let me just take that down. And it all came down to money for, well, for me, that if we  had the money to work with in order to work on capacity. That if we didn't, no, we would work on capacity. But if we didn't, then potentially modernization of our existing facilities could be a place to put our CIP money for a year and hopefully get back up to  to the regular numbers. But the number one thing and the big idea of it was we got to solve capacity issues. We talked about a number of things in there. One of the reasons for the school center too was that it was promised in the 2016 school referendum because if we all remember that was  In addition to the Woodbrook project, it was the big project to be able to provide a relief from a capacity for Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School. And they were still going to need that capacity release. And one point that was made that was so important is that space is increasingly important.  during the pandemic because of the spacing needs. And if we don't have the capacity, we can't do that. And if we could just slide it over, I can see what that last line was. Or is this the last we had?",

And I think we would be in agreement with that for this year, given that there are so many unknowns and uncertainty and whether there's even going to be any money forthcoming, that would be the focus that we had is just making sure we have space for our students in our most overcrowded areas. That being said,  We, well, we had topics for the long range planning. So that's actually for the next section. We did have a few discussions. Center two was not as high on our priority list overall. We also, a little contrary to what group one said about how spacing is increasingly important. We actually were having some conversations about how schooling might look different in the future, given the long range impacts of COVID and virtual learning and the opportunities that have kind of opened up with that. And so I think in our minds, we were kind of,  focusing more on the elementary schools. And I would be remiss if I didn't say it's particularly in the Southern Peter Patrick. Graham.

So our last part of the discussion, again, will be with the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee members. I want to thank those that are here. They have been online since the beginning of the meeting at 6.30, so thank you. Just as a quick reminder, the Long-Range Planning Advisory Committee exists to inform and advise both the school board and the superintendent in developing a long-term facilities planning needs.  Over on the right, you see some examples of the topics that they are charged with. If you want to get a sense of the scope, you can see the scope is pretty large and creative. And I know that group one even started talking about some of that. So I think that this year, this committee is going to be very important in providing you with recommendations next summer.  But to begin with, the committee is looking for you all to provide guidance to them as we just started meeting for the school year. We will meet for the full school year and come back to you with whatever guidance that you have given them. Here are the members most, I think, present. So if you all could maybe unmute and, whoops,  unmute and turn your videos on and just give a quick introduction to yourself to both the school board and the public, so that we know who you are for those in attendance today.

Also the capacity issues, once we follow out with what happens with both.  Crozet and Mountain View, and then looking at whatever else comes next with that. Second piece was modernizing our existing facilities, both to take advantage of modern technology, modern teaching techniques, but also to be able to deal with whatever the next Black Swan event is, whatever the next pandemic type thing might be, so we can be better prepared if  we can, right? So it's just one of those things.

But with Mountain View, close to 700 students,  And without space to expand, we actually do need to tackle that problem area at some point. So that's what is the right size for elementary schools? What are we going to do about Mountain View? And how does that fit in with the study of our middle schools?

It is with the school with Albemarle, Greer, Jack Jewett, and soon to be a Boys and Girls Club. It has terrible traffic patterns. It has  both the transportation and gas station and building services. But there's an opportunity, I think, to rethink that campus and look at what it could be, even if it's not tomorrow, if it's a 10-year plan.
