Our community members have a variety of choices in classes from real creative sort of classes like raising chickens from eggs to beginner and advanced use of Excel to  staying safe in social media, to stone carving, to one of my favorites, the kids in the kitchen series. Kids are baking things such as holiday cookies, pizza night, cupcakes, and also taco Tuesday. We also would like the board to know that we're featuring two classes that may be of interest to them. The first is what is culturally responsive teaching?  And this class will be taught by an equity specialist on October 13.

Tonight, we have sort of the sad time that we are losing our student rep that has been with us for the last three months, AJ. And to sort of commemorate this occasion, here's a letter that we will be sent to AJ.  DAAJ, on behalf of our school board and school division, I want to express our admiration for your contributions this year as a representative of more than 13,000 students. This past quarter has called us to make important decisions to increase our support and protection of students, not only through a pandemic that brought great risk into our communities, but through such urgent policies as that which expands the protection of some of our most vulnerable students.  What has impressed us all is how consequential a representative can be, even without formal voting authority. Your willingness to speak up, to bring issues into clarity by sharing students' insight and experiences, and the thoughtfulness of your advice has led to better decisions by our board. When we created this position, our goal was not only to enhance the quality of our decisions,  for students and families, but to provide student leaders with the opportunity to learn more about representative governance, collaboration, and the courage of sharing convictions. If the state designed an SOL test for such public service, they would have to create a grade of A++++ for UHA. I hope you won't mind, but I want to share something you said in your application.  You wrote that your interest represented you going after something I've never imagined myself ever doing. It's me trying to achieve something that I never felt I could achieve. I think you expressed what many of our students and adults, I might add, have thought.  Congratulations on being such an outstanding role model, and through your engaging and collaborative leadership style, demonstrating that unity of purpose always is a process of addition. Best wishes for much success this year at our community lab school. Sincerely, Graham Page Chair, Albemarle County School Board. Hear, hear.  AJ, I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you have any comments for us at this time?",

School Board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members. As authorized by Ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the School Board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The school board is nevertheless committed to encouraging public comment, despite its need to meet on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments can be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all school board members for review, or you can email us directly, or ask the school board together. Second, as long as the school board holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the date of the meeting.  Tonight we have 12 speakers. One of them just dropped out. So 12 speakers, which means that each speaker will have two minutes to speak. I will try to indicate when you have a minute left, but it's not a great notification. It's my finger up. So you want to look out for it, please, or be cognizant of your timing yourself. Speakers during the meeting or those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial districts.  speakers should limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governments or the operations of the school division. Although the school board will not provide or will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. And Chair Page, I see that AJ mentioned that he had fixed his sound. Did you want to loop back to that right now or you want to do it later in the meeting?",

So first, I just want to say thank you to the school board and to Superintendent Hawes for all of the diligent work and focus that was given to the situation at Mountain View back in the late spring and early summer with the fifth graders, rising fifth graders. I'm a parent of two kids at Mountain View in the Scottsville district, and we appreciate the fifth graders being able to stay at Mountain View this year. So thank you for that.  I'd like to speak tonight briefly about the busing situation and the lack of bus drivers. And just wanted to offer some ideas and suggestions for ways to possibly bridge that gap with the driver shortage. I know that there are other districts in other states that have reached out to their National Guard.  to get drivers. So if that's something that the school board has considered. There's also been some districts that have paid parents to be the drivers for their kids to kind of help if there was issues with paying for gas or things like that, or giving gas cards to families that might be an impediment to getting their kids to school.  Other ideas would be, especially for our elementary kids, school gets out pretty early if you're going to do pickup. Also, because of the pickup lines being so long, at least at Mountain View, when I go to pick up my kids, I have to get to school at 145 and sit there in my car with my baby until dismissal starts at 225 in order to not be  stuck out on Avon Street, which is a safety issue, and basically and stopped traffic. So, you know, maybe there's a situation where we could, especially for the elementary kids, have parents sign up for supervising sessions after school for an hour of recess time and let the kids play and then have pickup times be at 330 or something that might  allow for more parents to be able to pick up and not be on the bus. So I think there are just some creative solutions and I'm happy to be part of that.",

    "text": " Hi there. I'm in the Rio District. So I have emailed every single one of you a document with compiled research on the effects of masking on school-aged students. I received no response. I realize that the school board is impacted by a top-down effect for COVID protocols, but there are things that are within your control, and you have chosen to shirk your responsibilities to read, understand, and use data and statistics to drive decision-making for our children. Remember that ACPS teaches statistics to our kids.  As a pediatric speech-language pathologist, the research on the harmful impact of masking is daunting. But before I get to that, I want to share that children have a .000005 chance of dying from COVID. How does this stack up against children killed in car accidents? They are 11.5 times more likely to die in a car accident than from COVID. 11.5. A risk-reward calculation should and must be used when making decisions that impact our children. Back to masks. The great news about the kinds of masks our kids wear to school  is that they're 10 to 12% effective, according to a recent study at the University of Waterloo.  Said differently, masks are 88 to 90% ineffective. Why does that matter? Because as the paper I emailed all of you delineates, masking impacts the social-emotional development of at-risk children, literacy and phonological development of early readers, speech-language development and self-advocacy for children with special needs, and a significantly decreased acoustic environment for all in a classroom. While some of you are at a local gym working out within six feet of your trainer unmasked, you know who you are,  Our children are trying, trying their best to breathe, read lips and facial expressions, learn phonemes and hear clearly while an unbreathable barrier with 10 to 12% efficacy is strewn across our children's faces. On a related note, as a former scholastic and collegiate athlete and former varsity coach at an ACPS high school,  I find it appalling that you would be requiring vaccinations for student athletes as yet another power grab and mass shaming incident. These athletes who drive themselves to practices and contests are 11 and a half times more likely to kill themselves getting there than they are of ever dying from COVID, yet you're giving them an ultimatum. If you want to play the sport you love, you must sacrifice your own bodily autonomy to us, even though the risk of you dying from this thing is so nil. It's time for some perspective. Thank you.",

    "text": "Okay, thanks. My name is Julie. And I'm in the Scottsdale district. It's been my son's dream to play varsity soccer since he was four years old.  So I have some questions and comments about the new mandates. How can you mandate an injection for my son when studies show kids his age are 3.7 times more likely to get heart inflammation than to be hospitalized with COVID? When the people you're following orders from are corporations that are knowingly killing tens of thousands of people and have been paid out millions in lawsuits?  when you are not mandating the unvaccinated athletes to test weekly when we know that vaccinated people are spreading the virus? How can you mandate weekly tests for my son when tests are inaccurate and the FDA has told us they don't work to differentiate the cold, the virus, or a flu? You are mandating an injection for my child that, quote, mirrors a mild cold or allergy symptoms or stomach illness, end quote, as said by the Baker Butler newsletter to the parents this week.  You and I may disagree on who we trust, as far as coven, or the injection goes and I'm personally more scared of the injection than the virus and if there's a risk there needs to be a choice. And I choose to take my chances with the virus, not the injection This is my child, encourage us parents, no matter what side of the engine.  injection we are on. These are huge medical decisions and hard either way, but it's not your choice. So tell me why my son needs to be put through more stress, wondering if he'll get to play each week. Tell me why you're breaking a 70 plus year code that states that voluntary consent is essential, should and should be such as to yield fruitful results.  When will you stand up for our kids? When will you be more concerned about their mental and emotional wellbeing rather than the choices that we're making as parents? This mandate may take my son's high school varsity dream away, but I'd rather that dream than his life. Thank you.",

And I would like to comment on the requirement for athletes to get the COVID-19 vaccine.  or submit to weekly testing. Data from the Blue Ridge Health District portal shows clearly that there's been zero deaths under age 40 in the entire health district since March. So this is not something that is actually a risk to children in this area. And there's also no data that the shots are safer than that. There's just not.  Data from Albemarle County Schools says that over 80% of the students have already been vaccinated. So why are students being coerced into taking a medical intervention that has a risk of serious adverse events, especially for the 16 to 19 age group, referring to my myocarditis. Just recently at the CDC meeting, Dr. Matthew Oster recently told the FDA task force that mRNA vaccines are linked to this serious side effect in that age group.  And are you, the school board, going to be financially responsible for the care or the medical bills of a child who's injured by this because they were coerced into taking this experimental injection that's liability-free and is made by criminals? I hope that someone sues you because it's ridiculous that you would require that of children.",

Honestly, you know, when I approached this meeting today, thinking of speaking about all that's going on with COVID and the response within the schools, I found it quite, quite overwhelming. I just, I really decided to narrow in on one point. And that's the point that we're trying to play a role that is not  the role we're supposed to be playing here. We're trying to play a medical role. Our role as educators is to provide people with information, reliable statistics and resources, and educate them and help them make the best decision for the safety of their children. And instead, we're addressing everybody's fears with, this is what we're going to do to make you safe. We're going to make this decision for you. But that's not our role.  None of the people on the school board or in the school system are hired medical professionals that have been hired by families. Your role is to educate. And so therefore, instead of making mandates on people's health concerns, you should be providing statistics and reliable information in a newsletter or some sort of board that's created  from volunteers, I'm a medical professional, I'll volunteer, I'll go through studies, put out a newsletter once a month, and tell them the reality of things, because people are just scared. And so all these parents think, I'm so scared because of what's being told to me by all these officials. I need to comply to this in order for my kids to just get back to a normal life. And it's just so wrong. And it's such an abuse of power. And it's not our role.  It's not the education system's role to make a medical decision for any individual. It's encroaching on people's civil liberties. And when you do things like that, like the lady previously mentioned, you become liable.",

    "text": " I'm in the Ravana district. I oppose the policy requiring all student athletes to receive the vaccine or be subjected to weekly testing. The recent CDC update shows the vaccine is not as effective with the Delta variant as it was with the Alpha variant. This is evident as we see vaccinated staff members continue to get infected. If the goal is to prevent the spread of the disease, then all should be tested instead of just singling out a small minority.  This is clearly not equitable and creates barriers. The children of parents that have the flexibility or means to take them to get tested will be able to play sports. Those without will not. It is in direct contradiction to ACPS's value statement of, we will mitigate barriers and provide opportunities for every student to be academically successful. We know that playing sports allows students to do better academically.  Proposing to test these athletes during the school day singles them out amongst their peers and teachers. Kids notice everything. It risks violating their medical privacy and FERPA. It seems the purpose of this policy is to make things more difficult for families that have chosen not to vaccinate their athletes. Healthy, active teens are in the lowest risk category. Regarding quarantining policies, I wholeheartedly support quarantine measures if they are indeed preventing the spread. Unvaccinated students are required to quarantine if exposed.  Since the vaccine shows decreased efficacy against the Delta variant, should we not be quarantining everyone considered a close contact? Considering the interruption to education and the burden to families that quarantining causes, is ACPS collecting data to determine if it is effective? Does the data show that the students who are quarantined are subsequently testing positive? What is the threshold for determining if quarantining is worth the negative impact it is causing students and families?  For the sake of transparency, will the board please share that information with the community? Thank you.",

So I appreciate that you guys take the time to listen to all of us parents about lots of concerns. I know that you're doing your best. So my name's Allison Nagel. I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm a mom to a little boy with special needs named Carter, who until recently was a student at Brownsville in the special education preschool program there.  With only two minutes, I just want to present four points for your consideration regarding the mask mandate for all students in the county. For some context, I'm 100% pro-masking, pro-vaccine mandates, hugely support the spirit behind the policies that are there to protect our kids, and my specific concern is for how this is impacting children with disabilities.  So first, the lack of flexibility in the mask policy to accommodate disabled students contributes to inequity in learning opportunities for our most vulnerable kids. It's not in accordance with CDC policy. It's not in accordance with the state of Virginia policy, both of which allow for exemptions in the case of disability. Second is that the policy is only not illegal and discriminatory because, according to the county, you guys have provided an acceptable alternative, right?  So for disabled children, offering virtual learning to those who simply cannot access that form of education is not acceptable it is not at all the same. My child has attended to a screen, exactly zero times in his entire life.  He received speech therapy, physical therapy and occupational therapy during the school day, none of those services can be replicated online and none of them are presented as alternatives there was no access to the services, the disruption in his services would have been hugely impactful to him.  Third, I know you are facing impossible situations, and you're making impossible choices. And I completely get that. But you took a challenge right the challenge is how do we educate children who cannot wear masks because they are disabled.  And he took it and he thrust it back at parents who were just trying to do our best. And we got no warning. So I got a call that told me that my child had four days to show vast improvement in a skill that he simply does not have that we worked on for 18 months. And that if he did not show improvement, he could not come back to school. Am I out of time?",

    "text": "OK, so you hear me? Yep. OK.  Thank you, members of the school board for your time and attention. People often reduce issues like whether vaccine mandates are moral to scientific questions. Science does give us valuable facts like at the FDA hearing on whether to approve boosters for all. A scientist reported the rate of vaccine induced myocarditis in 16 and 17 year old boys  to what has one in 317 science also tells us valuable information about coven risk, like it is highly dependent on age, and secondarily obesity, even though sometimes young and healthy people die for children the flu is more dangerous than coven even though children to can die.  But science only gives us information about the questions that are asked. For example, the CDC told us that teens are more likely to be hospitalized from COVID than from vaccine-induced myocarditis, but there have been no published studies directly comparing teen hospitalizations from COVID to teen hospitalizations from all vaccine side effects or the extent to which either category of hospitalization depends on obesity or other health factors.  Science gives population-level risk factors, sometimes broken into demographic groups and often not. For each of us as individuals though, of course, it cannot tell us whether risks of the vaccine outweigh the risks of COVID. Given that all pharmaceutical interventions involve risk, we have to ask, who is best suited to evaluate the individual factors that go into a cost-benefit analysis that may involve serious injury or death?  It is clear to me that values, not science are required to answer this question. We've heard a lot of messaging that the benefit is worth the risk, but the benefit to whom compared to the risk to whom, given the difference between demographic groups and risk.  For both the vaccine and the virus, it is clear that mandates, in fact, sacrifice the health of some for others. What I ask from each of you is that you take the time to sincerely listen inside yourself to your heart's deepest wisdom or to pray if you pray for guidance on this matter. Is this decision regarding this life or death matter yours to make for the children and staff in this district? Thank you.",

We've been getting phone calls this week that our transportation would be one hour late. I'm unable to make that work.  do my job for the teachers that I serve each day. I called the school to see if there would be availability for early morning drop-offs, as there have been in the past, obviously prior to COVID, in order to support me in trying to do the job that I was hired to do and to support my girls so that they're not missing instruction.  I know that there are, these are difficult times and you can't create people out of nothing, but there are some other consequences that that are affecting teachers and people and I think we need to be thoughtful about all the consequences when decisions like this are being made.  And I'm pretty fortunate. I'm in a family that has two cars. I'm in a family that has relatives nearby. But I'm not sure that's the case for everyone. So I just would hope that you would think about all of us and how these decisions are impacting everyone. Thanks.",

    "text": " Good evening, board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning for the school division. And I'm here tonight to provide a COVID-19 status update, as well as an update on our staff vaccination program. And with me tonight is Eileen Gomez, our school nurse coordinator and our COVID coordinator who can provide some insights into any questions you may have. And also joining us tonight is Ryan McKay from the Blue Ridge Health Department, who can also give us some information later in the  presentation. So let's get started. So as you know, we have realigned the format of our update with the most recent guidance provided to us by the Virginia Department of Health. And as all public schools in Virginia are required to open five days a week for in-person instruction, the newly updated guidance provides five steps for school divisions to consider as operational decisions are made during the 21-22 school year. The first of these steps is to evaluate the level of community  disease transmission at the local level. So the level of community transmissions discernment is determined using two measures. The first is the total number of new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days. And the most recent data we have is from Tuesday, September 21. And at that time, our seven day  total per 100,000 people was 276 cases, putting us in the high transmission category. The second measure is the percent of NAAT tests that are positive during the past seven days. And our latest percent positivity is 5.4%, which puts us in the moderate transmission category. And when those two indicators are at different levels, the VDH recommends using the indicator with the higher value. So our community transmission level at this time  is in the high category, as you can see the entire Commonwealth of Virginia. So the second step is to understand the community level of vaccination coverage. And as I've said before, this continues to be a bright spot in Albemarle County. In Albemarle, we have 86.3% of our 12 to 15 year olds vaccinated with one dose, and that's up from 84.3 the last time we spoke.  and we have 87.7% of our 16 and 17-year-olds with at least one dose of vaccine up from about 86.9. In terms of fully vaccinated students in those populations, our 12 to 15-year-olds have hit 77.9% up from 75.2, and our 16 and 17-year-old age group is at 80.9 up from 79.1%.  And the third step in our operational decision-making is to consider the level of impact that the virus is having within our schools. So now that students have returned to school, we can again use this metric as an operational strategy. And as expected, we continue to have positive cases in our schools, and the vast majority appear to be isolated cases. We are, however, tracking a small number of suspected connected cases where there are at least two or three cases in one class.  We'll continue to work with the Blue Ridge Health Department to determine if these are actual school to school transmissions. And so we are probably hovering between the low and the medium depending on the outcome of of those findings at the Blue Ridge Health Department.  One of the second criteria we have a student absenteeism, and we have started to put a little bit more of a metric around this, we are going to use our school year 1819 attendance rate as our baseline. That year, our division average and 95% attendance rate over the course of the year.  And since our last board meeting, our overall attendance rate in our schools was also at 95% for non-COVID absences. So our non-COVID absences are really staying about the same as our baseline is. When we look at today's COVID absences, we see that 2.7% of our students were working from home today due to COVID quarantine requirements. So our actual attendance rate was closer to 92% with that factored in.  So this would probably put us at the slightly above baseline or the medium level of impact for student absenteeism. And finally, we look at staff capacity. And as we speak to principals throughout the division, I really feel that we've got to classify our staff capacity as strained in the medium level here. We are seeing multiple schools in which teachers and administrative staff are having to cover classes for absent teachers because their positions were not picked up from a substitute.  That's a strain on a school. We'll continue to monitor all of these factors, both at the school and the division level, and we'll continue to make operational decisions on a school by school basis based on the level of impact at that particular school.  And as a final piece of our report, I'll remind the board of our layered approach to prevention strategies in our schools. We have and continue to have, we feel, strong mitigation strategies, which include promoting vaccination, consistent and correct use of masks, physical distancing, enhanced ventilation, a proper hand-washing and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, having everyone stay home when they're sick and get tested, and contact tracing in combination  with isolation and quarantine.  In addition to our COVID metrics tonight, I'd like to provide you with some updated information about the status of our staff with regard to the COVID vaccine. As we shared at our last meeting, we've been collecting vaccine status information from our staff. This chart shows the updated information between our last meeting and now regarding all of our full and part-time regular employees. So as you can see, about 90% of all of our employees are fully vaccinated.  We've broken that out, broken that our teachers into a separate group. And here you can see that about 96 percent of our teachers are fully vaccinated. We know that these numbers will fluctuate as we gain and lose employees and as vaccination status changes for some employees.  When we take a deeper look into our teachers, you can see the breakdown between our instructional levels. We have about 95% of our elementary teachers, 97% of our middle school teachers fully vaccinated. This high rate of vaccination is especially helpful to know as most of our students at these levels are not yet able to receive the COVID vaccine themselves. And we've also begun collecting data on our temporary employees as well as our regular employees who have been hired.  And as you can see from this chart, our athletic coaches, short and long term substitutes, student teachers, new hires, and other temporary employees also have a high rate of COVID vaccination. And we'll continue to collect the information from this group as new folks come on to those positions.  And I'd also like to provide the board with a brief overview of the COVID testing program. As a reminder, any employee, regular or temporary, must participate in weekly COVID testing if they are not fully vaccinated. We began this testing last Wednesday and to date have received the results of 194 tests. We're awaiting results of 83 recent tests and have 28 employees who will need to test by tomorrow to be compliant with the testing regulation.  While Genetworks indicates a turnaround of testing results in 48 hours, at this point, we are seeing a better than average return of 18 hours for those tests. In this first round of testing, we've had two positive tests. And as a reminder, all of our employees may utilize our four testing sites regardless of their vaccination status. They can come get a test anytime they'd like.  And finally tonight, we are happy to say we've got Ryan McKay back with us from the Blue Ridge Health Department, and I was going to turn the floor over to Ryan, just to give you a brief update of what he's seeing, and we're also happy to take any questions from the board. So, Ryan.",

    "text": " Thank you for the opportunity to come and speak. My name is Ryan McKay I'm the director of policy planning and coven operations for Blue Ridge. So, as you know, and the community knows we've seen a pretty significant surge related to the delta variant, and just sort of going backwards a little bit. As we've mentioned in other forums.  Delta arrived here in Virginia and specifically the health district right around the same time that the executive orders expired so we've lost any of the mandates that were in place regarding social distancing masking limits to the number of individuals who could attend social gatherings or events.  And so that combination of the Delta variant and the opening up of our community and our society has really contributed both equally into where we stand at this point. We have seen a pretty significant surge, obviously with schools in place and children back on buses and in elementary, middle and high schools.  we are expecting to see cases emerge. I think that the benefit to having gone through this for the last year, year and a half, is that schools across the district and specifically with Albemarle County have done a tremendous job to mitigate the risk to the extent possible.  And I think important in that is that relying on the schools to do the contact tracing, once a case does emerge, and if that child has been in school whether infectious quickly identifying those individuals so that they can work on contact tracing. And that's one important change I think we want to highlight tonight.  So in the past we've been contacting families whose children are identified as close contacts. And what we recognize is that we're duplicating a lot of the effort that's already been put in place by school nurses and administrators who have already reached out to families.  And so what we're doing is we're going to continue to collect those line lists, rely on the contact that schools have made to those families, but we're not going to duplicate that effort anymore. And what this does is it allows us to focus on some of the community cases that we haven't gotten to in a timely fashion related to this particular search. And by doing so, we actually think we're going to minimize the number of children who may come to school because they would be put in quarantine prior to arrival.  So it's just an example of how much confidence we have in the school's ability to identify close contacts and then provide that information in a timely manner.  We continue to prepare for boosters. The FDA approved late last night boosters for certain groups. One which is kind of a broad category right now is 18 to 64 year olds who work in an institutional or occupational place that presents some sort of exposure risk. We don't have details on what that really means and we'll need to wait for Virginia Department of Health to approve all of that.  And obviously we're keeping a very close eye on what the FDA may do with Pfizer for 5 to 11 year olds. This is really the next big step in providing another layer of mitigation for schools for children who want to come to school and really minimizing the risk again to another extent possible using that.  No trends right now in terms of cases. We're seeing a little bit of a dip, but I don't want to say that we're on a downward trend with the current surge. So really critical that we continue to maintain all of the mitigation strategies that have been successfully implemented thus far. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have from the public health perspective.",

I was contacted by a parent this morning who asked if it's not possible to do an antibody test because some people who have had COVID  have a certain level of immunity that may be comparable to having had a vaccine. Is that true? And if so, is there a test that could be quantified to say, hey, look, you have the antibodies, and so it would not be necessary to get a vaccine?",

    "text": "Well, I don't know if there's a test, but what I can say is that if an individual has tested positive for COVID,  they don't have to quarantine up to 90 days after that incident with COVID. Once 90 days is expired, we would have to put them into quarantine because there is the risk that they would get another infection. So vaccine is really what's going to be the long-term solution to preventing illness, serious health outcomes like hospitalizations or death.  So while it may be okay for a while post-COVID experience to have those antibodies, that wanes. And so really vaccination is the one thing that's going to last far beyond that 90-day period once someone has recovered from COVID.",

And then also, second part of that is, and I know that Patrick and I have had a back and forth on this, but I just want to have it out for people to hear about it. You know, Charlottesville is one of the divisions that's part of this statewide testing program, and we're not. And so I just want to hear, you know, what your guidance has been on that.",

    "text": " So first part, availability of testing. It has increased a little bit. I think what's the challenge is depending on the situation. So symptomatic versus asymptomatic testing. Primary care providers, physicians' offices, family practices aren't going to test unless someone is symptomatic with COVID. And in a lot of cases, they'll require sort of an evaluation before then.  to make sure that the child is actually at risk based on potential exposure history. Asymptomatic testing is a little bit harder to come by. There are a few places that do offer it. We offer it at all of our testing sites, the ones that we run in Charlottesville and Albemarle, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  We do ask that people pre-register, which makes it a little more difficult. We've had open slots over the last few weeks. So individuals may see a long line, but it's not that we don't have tests. It's a little bit more about the time and the wait. So it is a little challenging, but we do offer a lot of free testing. And our UVA offers Monday and Tuesday.  And then occasionally, Dr. Vergolis from UVA has set up some sites with his team. I know Jack Jewett was used a couple of times in the last two weeks, and I believe tonight there's one at Charlottesville High School. So it's available. It is a challenge for individuals to find it. We're working on expanding ourselves to be able to provide more testing in the community.  and in more rural areas. So, for example, if we set up a site in Crozet-Afton area, that would hopefully serve the western part of the county and, in addition, some folks in Nelson County. So it's there. It's a little difficult to find, but particularly a few Monday nights in Nelson County, we just didn't have a ton of people.  It's a little bit of a drive, but it is available. I think weekends are also difficult to find testing, which has presented a challenge, certainly for students in Albemarle County when the testing on the eighth day was required. I think lifting that will provide some more opportunities for parents who need symptomatic testing to get tested. And then hopefully once we're back up and running with some more staff on our side, we'll be able to increase that access.  Second part. So pool testing in the VISTA program with VDH, I know they're promoting this extensively throughout Virginia, there's a lot of different avenues with it. One of the things that we've advised schools, and I believe Dr. Bonds has mentioned this in other meetings with Charlottesville City.  is that there is a resource requirement to it that I think is a little bit more of a heavy lift than what we would expect. There's planning involved, there's logistics, identifying a location within a school, coordinating with students and families to get consent forms. So while the program does offer some staffing support, there is a lift on the school end. And I think there's an operational decision that schools have to make and consider  when they're doing that. In particular, it's going to be potentially on the nurses, given that there's consent forms, there's a little bit of a medical component to it. And if your nurses are the ones that are also doing the case investigation and contact tracing within the schools, it's a decision about that level of burden. I think the other thing too is a lot of this is to prevent in-school transmission from occurring. And as we just heard from Dr. McLaughlin, in-school transmission isn't really occurring. I know you're keeping an eye on a couple of cases in one classroom,  But the preventative measures that you've already been using are really working and have been really successful. And I think even the numbers for in-school transmission last year, especially during the surge in February and March, were extremely low.  It is appropriate and we would recommend it when schools have had significant difficulty keeping transmission outside of school and unable to do it inside of school. There are some sort of smaller parts of that program that you may find to be more beneficial. Teams, for example, would be another area where that testing could take place. But again, I think it's looking at what's currently happening within the school.  Is in-school transmission occurring at a regular rate? And if so, and if you can't identify the reason why, that might be an opportunity to reconsider that. Schools in our district have been tremendously successful. They're gonna make decisions based on their need, obviously, but from what we're seeing with Albemarle County and a lot of the other schools, I'm not sure that it would add much benefit, given the percentage of students that you would be required to test, so about 20%, and in the number of cases you may find.  Again, those individuals who test positive as part of the pool process would still continue to go to school until the individual PCR test comes back. So it wouldn't necessarily reduce the number of students going into quarantine.  That's kind of our perspective and our thought on it. It really depends on the current situation within the schools. It really depends on what we're seeing in that in-school transmission and then the operational readiness of the school system to support it, even if most of the lift is done by the vendor.",

And we have an hour today before the break to do a bit of self-evaluation. And just to remind you and the public, on our agenda, there is a link to the self-evaluation form that six out of seven of you filled out.  where you were able to submit to Ms. Johnson your evaluation of the board, your self-evaluation, and then she compiled that into a total summary document that is available on the website. And so in the second tab of that spreadsheet, there are several reflection questions that the folks who put this together for us, this template that's used in many other school districts, recommend. And so I picked three of them since we have just 60 minutes today.  And I wanted to pause and first sort of check in with everyone, as always, to see if you think I picked the right three, and if there's anything else that needs to be discussed about what I have chosen, along with Mr. Page's good guidance and counsel, to see if you all agree that this is the best way to spend your time today, okay? So let me go ahead, and let's see, I think I can share my screen. Can everyone see if I have sharing rights? I do, thank you.  Okay, let's take a look at this. So these are the three of the questions that I picked for us. What are the top two or three positive takeaways that stand out to you about how your board operates? What are the top two or three growth areas you would identify? And are there lessons or action items you would prioritize based on your assessment and reflections? What are they? And what next steps are you considering?  So with those in mind, let me just pause for a moment. I'll stop the share so people can kind of come off mute. We've all worked together a lot in the past, so I'm really open to your thoughts on whether or not this is the best way to spend our time tonight. Anyone have a comment or a question about what I have proposed?",

One is, and this is post COVID, is that we need to, I think as a group, have a more public presence in our magisterial districts, in our schools.  I know that just about everybody has still been going to see their schools during this period. And I hear about it when I'm in a school. And so it's very, very appreciated. And it really gives us a chance to see what's happening and how the kids are doing. And we all do have myriad stories about that. The second one is continued PD.  And I think professional development is something that we're pleased where we are, but we can be better. And we can be better from learning more. And having conversations like these is a big part of it. But I think more PD, we had a great book study last year that was extremely worthwhile, in my opinion. And then the third one is,  really working on developing the anti-racism policy and preparing our students for the most diverse population ever in the United States, that they will all be coming of age during that period. And I think preparing them  through some of the things that we're doing and other things that will come through Dr. Hairston and his group and from members of the board, I think will be of great importance for all of us. And I would also throw in just a fourth one, I'll make it quick, is I'd really love to have all of us have a strong interest in the CIP projects.  and to give a lot of thought to what our priorities should be.

I mean, I really do want us to have a quicker feedback loop in terms of the progress, substantively what's being done, what needs to be done. Is there anything else the school board can do?

It's been something that's been particularly difficult this last year because of covid. I know that I haven't been to as many schools or events as I would normally get to. It's been difficult.  In the beginning, Zoom made it seem like it was actually easier because you got to kind of pop into things. But I would look forward to in the next year figuring out ways that we could have more engagement with people. Focus on the achievement was my biggest one. And I am basing that on the rubric. The rubric for the evaluation is how to have high performing success and student achievement for all students. And that's one that I think we scored in total  fairly low, so just having it as a consistent point of our agenda items and meetings and a focus on the data and metrics and agenda. So at a majority of its meetings, the school board considers agenda items specifically related to advancing student achievement. I think we could work on that, which brings me to my third point, which is something I have heard feedback from various members. And it's something I think we've struggled with for a while is just agenda development and getting sessions and work sessions and items that were  passionate about and that we want to hear about. And I know we're doing some work with that. I know Jono and Judy have been meeting to try to get through some work sessions, but we've done various things in the past where we've tried to brainstorm. And I think it's just, there's some lack of clarity around like really what we're doing and how it's done. So those are my three items. Thank you.",

So those are the kinds of things that go along with how I think we're having an increased focus, but we certainly could focus more on achievement, how our schools are doing, what we're doing in individual schools, things like that, because I didn't have the answers to every question on the self-evaluation, and I probably should know them.",

I just, I feel terrible that our kids are being put in the position they're being put on I was really one of these Polly any people who thought you know what we're going to come out of this in the summer in the fall we're going to be back to normal it's going to be great. And it frankly kind of breaks my heart that we can't do that.  I don't doubt for a moment that we are doing everything we possibly can. And I get pretty damn discouraged when people make accusations about oh you this is a power grab or you don't care about the kids, I just, I get that irritates me so badly.  because I know how passionately the people on this board and the public employees at Albemarle County Public Schools care about our children. I mean, that's just I mean, we bleed for them. And so I just get discouraged. And, you know, it felt like before the pandemic hit, we were really on a roll. We were we were starting to become, you know, proactive as opposed to react.  We had, you know, we had, we had, you know, we had a perfectly balanced budget. We had, we had new programs that were going to be effective. And I feel for the past, the pandemic has put us back into a, into a largely reactive role where we're trying to, we're spending so much time trying to put a, put out fires and, and, and just keep the kids in school and keep the program so the kids can play sports.

Thank you, which is kind of a form reply and I don't have an answer.

I assume that the chair or that will be addressed. But then we get an email that says, well, you didn't respond to me. I didn't know it was directed to me.

I'm adding on to that one thing that I'd like to see kind of tied together a few things something that we'd implemented right before the start of coven and it never really got off the ground was having coordinated days at each school where to board members would get to go and we bring bagels or whatever treats.  And teachers can drop in and talk to us one on one and make their concerns and I thought that was a good program we only got to do it at like three schools and then it stopped but it's like a way to show appreciation and one of the best ways to show appreciation is, you know, give an opportunity for them to actually speak to you about their concerns and not in a public forum which I'm sure a lot of teachers don't want to come and give public comment to make their  their opinions and views heard, so I would love to see that re-implemented, and that would tie into my second thing, which is that more public engagement. I would love help on that, and just having things set up for what to do. It's been really odd with COVID, not really knowing when you should be going into a school, and so something I'd like to see growth on.",

And I would like to do it again, and be happy to talk with anybody about it, is that we did a reach out to parents in each of the different magisterial districts.  who were parents who we normally didn't hear from, who weren't comfortable, you know, doing something with, you know, talking to the school board, who weren't writing into us, who weren't calling us. And I would say that the one that we did in Kate's district and the one we did in  Ellen's now district were the two best because we had great turnout. And we learned a lot from that. I still remember the stories in both of those. And in Whitehall, we had pulled pork. That's true. That's true. That was pretty good barbecue. Yeah, that was good. And it was great for us. But we only had three parents who came.  You know, and so food wise, that was definitely the best. But that's something that I think we need the communication within our own divisions with parents. And so I think that could be a value. And then the other one that I'm going to talk with Jim Foley about  is to go down and spend an hour or two hours sitting in the lunchroom at the bus barn. And the last time I did that was two years ago. And I talked to probably 75 drivers who were coming through that room. Maybe 60-ish, but it was well over 50.  that, you know, it's just the thing of getting out and getting out and talking to the people who we want to trust us, you know, and to, you know, and it gets into the teachers, it gets into the staff, it gets into the parents and put ourselves out there.

The Long Range Planning Advisory Committee has requested that the school board develop and approve a policy to provide direction on the goals for school sizes to help them guide their planning for the future. Our goal in planning this work session for you is to provide a context for school size in ACPS and for you to talk about your thinking on school size as a board.  From your conversation and the ensuing notes, I suggest that Ms. Schmidt, Ms. Kumazawa, and I work with Dr. Acuff and Mr. Alcaro, who are our board's capital committee representatives, to draft verbiage for goals for desired school sizes for ACPS for future planning. We will bring the draft to the board for feedback and eventual approval.  Once approved, the verbiage would be embedded in policy FB, facilities planning. Policies are reviewed every five years, as you all know, and so the board will have future opportunities to review and make sure these goals make sense. The purpose of the school board's discussion tonight is to consider the efficacy of expanding and or constructing school buildings and making future plans. It is not intended to be a way to close existing schools.  And so with that, I'm going to turn things over to our Director of Budget and Planning, Maya Kumizawa.",

    "text": "In parentheses next to each school, you'll see how many schools are represented. The dotted horizontal lines that are going across represent our school divisions minimum, average, and maximum elementary school enrollments.  You can see here that our average aligns with the peer group's averages. Our smallest school, however, is smaller than most, and our largest school is larger than most. Moving on to the middle school level, similarly with the elementary schools, our average middle school size aligns very closely to this peer group's average middle schools. What's notable on this chart is that the range between  smallest and largest schools are much tighter in other districts. With the exception of Montgomery County, if you look just at the top of each cluster, the heights are not as wide ranging as ours. At the high school level, we see the biggest differences with the selected peer group. Our largest high school, Albemarle, is an exceptionally large school, pulling us towards the right side of the graphic.  Hanover County and Frederick County have a higher average than us, but you can see that their schools are more similarly sized. Next, I'm going to move forward to some financial considerations. 94% of our school-based budgets represent FTE costs, so I'm going to focus our attention there. Each school is provided with a base level of staffing represented by the navy blue.  and they include positions such as principals, directors, nurses, and lead custodians. They are provided no matter what the size of the school is, similar to fixed costs in a business. On top of this base level of funding, schools are provided positions that are generally dependent on a projected enrollment. The most relevant example of this is our classroom teachers. The specifics of FTE allocations are established in our adopted staffing standards.  There are also many other positions that are determined based on intervals or steps, which are a hybrid of these two types of costs. Here's some examples of financial impacts by size of school. At the elementary level, as you might imagine, budgets increase as the school size increases. On a per pupil basis, costs go down as school size increases.  While the per pupil cost between these three schools might not seem too significant, when you multiply the difference by the number of total students, you can see a significant total cost impact as shown in the last column. This is mostly due to the mix of base and variable costs as shown on the previous slide. At the middle school level, the cost differences are more visible. A lot of this has to do with demographic differences across these schools.  But at Walton, for example, staffing allocations are based on a whole harmless enrollment of 425 students in order to ensure that we offer a comprehensive middle school program to these students. In our high schools, two good schools to compare operating costs are Monticello and Albemarle, since their demographics are more similar to each other.  As you can see, the small per pupil cost difference when applied to large numbers of students have significant financial implications. Finally, a quick note on capital costs. On the left are some examples of recent expansion projects, and those may include renovations as well. On the right are recent estimates and the long-range planning advisory committee report of what new construction buildings may cost.",

    "text": "All right. And I believe Maya is going to continue the slides for me. So I will say next to indicate when to go next. We conducted a survey with the community. We reached out to everyone in the community and said, tell us a little bit about your experience in being in school.  and what you think are the right sizes, both in terms of minimum and maximum for our schools by level. We presented them with a little bit of information to begin with. So it showed them the average school size at the national level, at the Virginia State level, and then our school level, so that they could have a perspective on where would some boundaries potentially be.  We then gave them a series of options to select from as their ideal minimum and ideal maximum. For the minimums, we tried to identify the point at which we were thinking about theoretically the smallest school in our division. And we were also kind of roughly matching the cut point for the Hold Harmless funding that Maya mentioned, because we would ideally not recommend schools go below that Hold Harmless level.  At the maximum, we were looking at extending beyond where our largest schools were. We were also looking at extending beyond the scope of our current staffing standards. If we were to build schools that large, we would have to either reconsider our staffing standards or adjust our staffing models to accommodate schools that large. We also attempted to reduce the numerical gaps between any of the response options.  to the extent possible, so that people could feel like they were choosing something close to where they honestly felt they were, as opposed to a large, you know, 500 student gap, which felt like they were just getting lost in the abyss. We tried to provide as many options as possible to reduce those options. Next. So for our survey, we had over 3,000 responses, nearly 3,100 responses, which is excellent for our community.  The responses were largely by parents. We also had a very large response rate by students. We directly sent the survey out to students to try to solicit their feedback. We can look over on the right, we can see the demographic breakdowns for the race ethnicity. We can see we're kind of close in some of our groups, but we're maybe a little heavy on the white, a little light on that black and Hispanic, maybe a little heavy on the Asian as well.  close to a good demographic representation, probably ideal considering real world circumstances and a lot of external factors that affect people's ability to participate in these kinds of surveys. So I would say overall, a very high quality representation of where our community is in terms of demographic representation. Next. So these are the results that we will present.  For the minimum enrollment size, the community was pretty consistent and wanting somewhere between two and 350 students, which very tightly aligns with our minimum schools right now. When you look over on the left, you'll see a weighted score and a plurality score. The plurality score is whichever bar is the farthest to the right. The weighted score is using a weighted average of all of the scores. And so it's intended to give you a sense of, if you looked at the plurality and budged, which way would you want to budge?  So for minimum, ideally, we would keep schools at 200. But if we had to go bigger as a minimum size, the community would support going a little bit bigger. It's also possible they'd support going smaller if we allow that option to be visible. But given our hold harmless staff, then we didn't allow that option visible. The maximum, you can see that the plurality was at 500 with the weighted at 510. So they're really tightly in agreement that about 500 is where they want to see elementary schools stop growing.  And that's where the community largely has agreement about that decision. And so if the board were to present something in a policy around 500, there would be quite a bit of community support for that decision. Next. Middle schools were similarly in agreement. At the minimum, there was somewhere between three and 450 students, which is right in line with actually many of our middle schools. If you look at Walton, Lakeside, Jewett, Burley, they were all  kind of in that range with Lakeside, Burley, and Jewett kind of extending past that range slightly. So we're very much in alignment with where we are as a school division. When you look at the maximum, they're looking at a cap of about 600. If you had to push up, there would be a little bit of community support for pushing up beyond 600, but not a lot, which would primarily impact schools like Henley, which is well in excess of 668 students. And the next.  The high school, this is the one of the places that was the most interesting data point that we received. So the minimum was exceptionally consistent. They wanted small minimums for high schools. We didn't go below 1000 because that's a difficult number to project because that impacts things well beyond the considerations of this particular survey, including VHSL sports and  program after school programs, etc, etc, so it was very difficult to go beyond below 1000 as an option, because we simply don't have a school at that point. And even if we were to add let's say another high school or various centers we likely wouldn't go below 1000 at any of our schools. The maximum had a lot of variability there really wasn't a lot of consensus within the Community about what would be a good maximum size.  The plurality of support was behind about 1,200 students, which is slightly in excess of where Monticello and Western Albemarle High School are right now, but could push up to about 1,400, which sits right around where our average is for all of our high schools. There doesn't seem to be a lot of support for that 1,800, but there was a considerable amount of support for around 2,000, which was an interesting data point  We don't have a lot of information about why people would think that a school that large that's so out of line with the rest of our state, as well as the market comparison that Maya showed us. We're not really sure why there's that support there. So after we completed this, we also did a review of some existing research on school sizes. If we click next, we reached out to EAB, and they did some research on ideal school size.  And so I'm going to shift hats a little bit to go from statistics to economics. Economics is not my background, so I apologize to anyone who's listening who knows this stuff way better than I do. I'm using some terms loosely, but the idea that we got was there's not a lot of consistency in the research. There is some, there's plenty of research out there about ideal school size, but there's no one definitive answer of where is that ideal. What they identify are two competing priorities. The first is the  The economies of scale right so as some resources are fungible you can increase the student enrollment without increasing that resource let's say a principal right, we can have a principal school of 100. We can also have a principal of school 300 so the cost for that principal doesn't change across the number of students enrolled. Except that the cost per pupil changes, so there creates an economy of scale.  What the research did identify was the law of diminishing returns, which is where when you reach a point that the economies of scale begin failing. And it's specific to students who need specialized support. And so that was, if you look in that very far right column, the special education and disadvantaged populations, this is where the economies of scale begin to falter. And so if we give an example like  Albemarle high school with roughly 2000 students enrolled and we have roughly 10% of our students identified as special education. That means there are potentially roughly 200 students who are in need of special education services at Albemarle high school. If we average roughly 10% 10 students on a caseload you're talking about 20 special education folks working at Albemarle high school in concert with one another.  If anyone sat in a room of 20 people and tried to find agreement, you'll understand the law of diminishing returns when it comes to some of these specialized populations. Similarly, when we look at our students that are from economically disadvantaged homes, they receive special economic support around things like Title I. So if we start to increase the number of Title I teachers in a school, so you start to have five, six, seven, eight Title I teachers,  it becomes very difficult for them to have productive PLC conversations. And so again, the law of diminishing returns becomes a problem. So there's not a right answer, but the idea is trying to maximize the economies of scale. But stopping before we hit that law of diminishing returns is what the research tells us is sort of the best idea. And I believe that's the end of my section.",

The question is going to be what are we actually capable of  doing and implementing. And so that part, kind of the nuance of how we word our recommendation. Maybe I'm making an assumption. Maybe it's not just a given that smaller is better. So if the point of this is to kind of get how we feel, I would say for elementary school, I think small is good.  But I don't know if that's reasonable. And if we have to decide where schools are going to be small or not small, I guess we should try to make them smaller where there's a higher concentration of economically disadvantaged students.
