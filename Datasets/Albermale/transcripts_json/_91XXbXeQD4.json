    "text": " Thank you, Mr. Page. 2021 was the 40th year of the Piedmont Regional Science Fair, which each year brings together over 300 students from more than 12 school divisions in Central Virginia. The fair was established to create greater awareness and interest among students in project-based learning that utilizes advanced research and development skills in math and in science.  The need for programs such as this one is pretty clear from data that shows that some of our international competitors graduate 14 engineers each year for every one that we graduate in the United States. What's impressive about the fair is the relevance so many of the projects have to solving modern day problems and meeting current lifestyle needs. This year, something else was impressive about the fair.  For what almost certainly was the first time in its history, the two grand prize awards were earned by a brother and a sister for two separate projects. Our champions are Anna and Samuel Rosner from Albemarle High School and are both MESA students. Anna's project is a quote, a fall detection and prevention shoe for the elderly and balance impaired, end quote. That's just awesome.  Sandhill's project focused on, quote, analyzing political polarization through agent-based simulation, end quote. Here is a compelling statistic. Each year, about 36 million older adults experience a fall, and more than 32,000 of those falls result in death. Emergency rooms across the country each year treat more than 3 million older adults for injuries due to a fall. And I will say that my mother,  On a very personal note, my mother broke her knee in August because she fell down and was in a hospital or rehab for about a month.",

She's no stranger to success, having won the Congressional App Challenge earlier this year for, quote, feel better, end quote, a mental health support app for students.  For the fair, she experimented with a shoe purchased over the counter at a discount store, outfitting the shoe with sensors that can detect when the shoe wearer is about to fall. The shoe has supports that adjust to restore balance. That is so cool. Samuel took on a challenge very much in the headlines every day. He studied the social relationships that contribute to sharp political divisions in our nation.  Both Anna and Samuel automatically qualified for the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair. Both already have completed interviews with the judges in advance of the fair itself, which will be held virtually next week. Both also are with us this evening, and I'd like to ask them to share with us a little bit about why they selected their projects, what they learned, and how their research can benefit our lives.",

    "text": " Hello, I'm Anna. I'm super excited to be here tonight. So what really inspired me to create this project is I feel like falls are such a big issue and I feel like everyone has some sort of connection to it. I had a family member with Parkinson's disease, like there's something that I think affects everyone at some level and also like it's a concern for a lot of people.  Maybe they haven't fallen yet, but it's a worry that they might. That's something that inspired me to create this. Through creating it, I learned a lot about how to take something from the image that I had in my head and what I wanted to make.  into something that works. It's still very much a prototype. It's more of a proof of concept and the idea that the method I had in mind can be effective, but just from the sketches I had in a notebook and then being able to take that into a fully-fledged system with code and sensors and circuits  And to have done that is just something that I've learned so much from and how to just solve your own problems and just do the research, figure out what you need to get from point A to point B. And I mean, I think that the benefit that this research can have, I think, is very clear that  it's not enough to just have things that sense when falls happen. You need to have something that prevents them from happening because it's not enough to know that a fall has happened. At that point, the damage has occurred and falls are the second leading cause of  death among adults age 65 or older, the second leading cause of accidental death in adults age 65 or older globally. So it is a big issue and having something that can be engaged in the active prevention of these falls, I think is something that I definitely want to continue pursuing and working towards. And I'll hand it off to my brother, Sam, to talk about his project.",

And I feel like this is something which can really be helpful to each one of us in trying to help foster better discussion environments around us.  So my program came to the conclusion that what we really need to do to decrease political polarization and therefore increase the quality of our political dialogue is to separate our social relationships from our political beliefs. Basically, we shouldn't choose our friends. We shouldn't hold it against people that they might disagree with us, which I think is a really important lesson in the wider world.  Additionally, I investigated a wide number of interesting phenomena and how they relate to political polarization, such as people's skepticism of different views, moderation of the entire society, and several other more complex parameters.  And I think from this project, I've learned a lot about mathematical modeling, as well as the research process. And I think it was a very valuable experience for me.",

And whereas in Albemarle County Public Schools in recent years, visits by students and staff to school clinics have exceeded 180,000 or more than 140 visits each hour of every school day.  And whereas in a given year, our school nurses record more than 14,000 treatments of students with chronic conditions. And this year, 17 of our school nurses are members of the emergency medical core and have administered COVID-19 vaccines to employees. And whereas school nurses often are the first and on occasion, the primary healthcare provider for families. And whereas the instant actions  of school nurses in emergencies have saved lives, prevented more serious illness and injury, and contain the spread of infectious diseases in our schools, and whereas school nurses are invaluable connectors of the school community, families, and health care providers in promoting wellness and access to health care when a child's cognitive development is at its peak.  Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Albemarle County School Board does hereby express and call upon all members of the school division and residents of the county to express deepest appreciation to all of our school nurses for their extraordinary and selfless devotion to public health and safety every year, and especially this year, and further resolve that a framed copy of this resolution be provided to every school nurse in the division this May 13th, 2021.",

My name is Cindy Hersman of the Breivana District, and I'm a teacher with Albemarle County Public Schools and a parent of a senior at Albemarle High School.  I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of a group of concerned parents who volunteer in the AHS drama department. This year has been very abnormal and difficult for all of us due to COVID-19. The changes we've all had to make in our daily lives are notable. As the schools began to gradually open up to various activities back in March, we were all very excited to see our friends with kids involved in indoor and outdoor sports able to be spectators at these sporting events.  and see the joy on their kids' faces as they competed at every level.  We were encouraged that we as parents of theater kids would have the same opportunities to see our kids perform. It was unfortunately an extremely long process on a statewide level to advocate and protest the inequity that was on full display when it came to how the theater kids were designated versus their sports contemporaries. We saw numerous sports being played in extremely close proximity, sometimes without masks at all.  At that moment, we weren't even sure we would be able to witness our own kids perform even with masks and social distancing requirements in place. All the sporting events, games and tournaments across Virginia and even in other states for championships have all been allowed and even celebrated as they should be without any negative repercussions for participants or spectators. We're extremely grateful that we will be able to see and be in the in-person audience for the upcoming musical at Albemarle High School.  We would like to ask that some of the guidelines that are still being forced on the theater community be reviewed and adjusted to allow our kids to perform without the artificial limitations that were not considered feasible for their sports counterparts. There is no basis for the inequity that is on blatant display for how sports are allowed to be played without any physical distancing whatsoever, but are being arbitrarily forced on the theater department.  Our theater kids are not just being told to comply with the normal six foot distances, but now to an extended distance of 10 feet apart. If the idea behind this additional distance is due to projection of voices and fluids, it doesn't seem like that was considered for sporting events when players yell, scream, and cheer for their teammates during normal play. All in all, theater kids feel deeply the societal inequity that exists for the arts. We respectfully request  that you do whatever is in your power to show these artists that they are valued and celebrated as much as the athletes in the school district. In summary, we are simply asking for our kids to be able to perform on stage with the same exact guidelines that were given to their sports contemporaries. Thank you.",

I know the school board is limited and that you are not responsible for making specific hiring decisions or for curriculum design. But I do think you can continue to push for your stated commitment to anti racism.  And as we look to next school year, I urge you not to return to the status quo. I'd like to ask you to learn from this year and be really intentional about next year. And I think there are a few areas in particular that I'd like to ask you some questions about. So one question is whose priorities and needs are being centered? And one is around curriculum.  So in all subjects, but in social studies and in history in particular, just continuing to tell the truth about history. I know many states and many districts, there's been some pushback to telling the truth about history. And I just urge you to continue to hold your commitment to anti-racism as you have stated before.  I'm wondering about with the gifted identification, what measures are being used? I know that this has been in flux, and I wonder who is being excluded from these services. I wonder about the SOL tests, and when we didn't have the tests last year, how did that work out, in particular for students of color? Who do the tests benefit? Related to hiring decisions, I know that this has been an area of focus,  I'm wondering, who are you bringing into the school division and what leaders and educators can students benefit from learning from different perspectives and wisdom that all students can benefit from? With regards to books, classroom study, and in the library, whose stories are being told?  With regards to the school resource officers, I know that they have been removed from the school. The MOU has been eliminated and I really appreciate that. And I am still very wary of these newly created positions of the safety coaches. And I would like to continue to push on who's safety is being prioritized and just to really keep a lens of anti-racism in the hiring decisions and the unrolling of this program.  Regarding ongoing professional development, I know that the county has been moving in the right direction with culturally responsive teaching. And I just wanna make sure that this isn't a flashy project, that this is something that continues to have sustained and ongoing effort and attention. I wonder about the overall school environment. And I just wonder, aside from COVID, are there other reasons that families of color have felt safer keeping their children at home? And so when we open up next year, what are we going to do to create a safe school environment for all children?  So in closing, COVID-19 is an invisible disease that we work together as a community, not only to mitigate, but are working to eradicate. So what if we work with this same energy, commitment, and effort to fight the invisible disease of racism?",

I'm very proud to be serving with this admirable group of professionals. I'm very pleased to share with you the numbers this week. As you can see on this slide that the case counts have been falling  As of today, Albemarle County's seven-day floating or moving average of number of new cases per 100,000 people is 2.1. Case counts have been decreasing for the past 24 days, which exceeds the threshold of 14 days. So this is considered a decreasing trend. I believe this is the lowest number that we've had this school year and since I've been looking at the data.  The seven day floating or moving average for the percent of COVID cases tests that were positive is under 1%, 0.9%. This indicator has been decreasing for 24 consecutive days. So this is also considered a decreasing trend. The numbers for Charlottesville have also been very good.  The seven day moving average of number of cases per 100,000 residents as of today is 1.9. This indicator has been decreasing for the past 38 days, which exceeds the threshold and is considered a decreasing trend. The percent positivity of Charlottesville has also dropped. You can see that as of today, that's 0.5%. And this has been decreasing for the past  42 days, that's also considered a decreasing trend. The numbers of cases at UVA remains low. Over the last two weeks, they reported a total of nine cases, six in students and three in staff. So we're very pleased with this progress. I'm also just going to update you a little bit about the youth vaccination rates. As of  Yesterday, the Pfizer vaccine was only on license for children ages 16 and above. But as of last night, they issued the approval for use in youth ages 12 to 15. But they have not yet reported on the data of those kids receiving their vaccines as of today. But for the other age group, 16 to 19, with a little bit of math and estimations, I can tell you that  The vaccination rate for 16 to 19 year olds in this community is about 50% for these people who have received one dose. And to be considered fully vaccinated, we are at about 31% of this age group. So that's all very good news. Dr. McLaughlin?",

That's primarily because  Our core indicator for case incidents has fallen below the 50 cumulative cases per week.  total into the moderate level. I believe to get to the low level, you need fewer than 10 cumulative cases over a seven-day period. And if you recall, we do see this one spike here. You may remember that a couple of weeks ago, we had an anomaly with the numbers where 65 additional cases were added in to the Albemarle numbers from testing that had been done over the course of several weeks. So that's good news.  really all around. When we look at our level of school impact, we still feel that our impact in the schools is very low. We have very sporadic cases with no evidence of transmission, no impact on student absenteeism other than normal absenteeism, and staff capacity is at normal levels.  And when you put those two together, for the first time, I think, since we've been reporting on these metrics, we've actually moved to the lowest level of impact on the CDC chart when you put our moderate level of community transmission and our low level of school impact. So, you know, it hasn't been often we could come with really good news to the board, but I think the trends certainly are, have been in our favor over the past couple of weeks.  and we'd be happy to take any questions from the board.",

    "text": "Good evening. My name is Rosalyn Schmidt. I'm chief operating officer. Tonight, I just want to provide a brief update on four studies that are either underway or will be shortly that will help inform our long range facilities planning. So those four studies involve Mountain View Elementary,  Lamb's Lane campus, the Brookhill Proffer site, and then renovations at Albemarle and Western Albemarle High Schools. First, I want to start with Mountain View Elementary as some background. Next fiscal year's capital budget now, with the passing of the Board of Supervisors budget earlier this month, officially includes a modest expansion of the school and some site improvements.  Due to its limited site as well as an already large school size with over 700 students, no further expansion is recommended. And as stated when the project was first recommended, it addresses current space needs and minimal enrollment growth. So it is not intended to be a long-term solution and further study is recommended. So that's what this study will help us do. We have hired a consultant to help us develop a more long-term solution.  They will be conducting a subdivision yield analysis to help us better understand potential growth and would develop options for consideration. And a key component of this study is to get stakeholder feedback. We are meeting with the staff tomorrow morning and the first community meeting is scheduled next week. The purpose of these initial meetings is to get a brainstorm on the topic. The project team will then develop specific options for consideration and return in June for feedback on those options.  We estimate the work to conclude this summer and will present to the board for your consideration as you finalize your CIP requests. The second study I want to update you on is what we refer to as the Lambs Lane Campus. This is the campus that includes Albemarle High School, Jack Jewett Middle School, Greer Elementary School, Ivy Creek School, both of our building services departments and our vehicle maintenance facility, which houses our transportation department and fueling station.  and it will soon be the new Boys and Girls Club Center. As you can tell by this aerial, and if you visited, it's a very dense and highly utilized area that needs further study to ensure that the campus is equitable and that we have a long range vision to best utilize the limited land that is available. So what we're doing in the short term is we are planning improvements on Lamb's Lane itself,  science improvements and screening that is being installed along Limes Lane as a part of the Safe Route to Schools grant. And then, as well as the construction of the new Boys and Girls Club Center. For more long term planning, however, we are in the process of hiring a consultant to create a master plan for the area. The study would include community engagement, determine challenges, opportunities,  and vision for the campus. And that would include recommendations for necessary traffic improvements, both vehicular and pedestrian, and a conceptual master plan for future use and opportunities, including potential relocation of our support services, staff offsite that would provide additional instructional opportunities in green space to the schools that remain on the campus. We estimate the master plan to be complete in about six to 12 months, and we'll report our findings to the board.  The third study is related to the Brookhill proffer. So Brookhill is a development along 29 North on the East side of 29, just North of Polo Grounds Road, as you travel away from town. If you recall, as a part of that development, the county was proffered two parcels of land. One is actually in the development itself, which is intended to be the site for a future elementary school.  And the second was actually not in the development, but across 29 between the Berkmar Extension and Ryle Mills Road, that long sliver of space that was intended for a comprehensive high school in the future. But as you can see in the language of the proffer, there's some flexibility and other uses for that property.  As a reminder, it's a very narrow site with very challenging rock and terrain, and this is a visual of a school similar in size and amenities to Monticello High School. So this study is actually being done by the local government and county staff as directed by the Board of Supervisors. They have directed staff to engage in a study to evaluate additional uses of this site.  While the high school will certainly still be considered, other options under consideration are the relocation of our vehicle maintenance facility as one example, but more technical analysis of the grades will inform the possibilities. This study is in the very preliminary phases. It is our understanding that staff is to present a proposal to the BOS about the scope and time on the study in June. We will keep apprised of the progress of that study.  Lastly, I want to highlight work at Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle. If you recall, the high school facility planning study done by F&I back in 2017, which recommended the center model, also recommended improvements to existing schools. Due to the age and condition of the facilities, Albemarle and Western Albemarle were prioritized first. That study included a simple cost per square foot estimate for the work, but limited details on scope. So this study is intended to further define the scope and cost.  We are also planning stakeholder engagement to better define priorities and opportunities. The study was previously underway, but was paused last spring due to economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have since re-engaged the consultant and have a scheduled completion by November.  So again, that was a quick overview. But those are four, I think, exciting work underway. I hope it provides a glimpse of the early stages of work that will ultimately result in projects in our long-range facilities planning. And I hope you also see our commitment to get stakeholder feedback at beginning stages of a project's lifecycle. So I'll now open it up to any questions or comments you may have.",

As a reminder, we're working off of a baseline of the school board's approved funding request that you approved in March. Since then, we've received more information about anticipated revenues for next year, primarily from state revenues, which now includes  a 5% salary increase for SOQ-funded positions, the state's portion of the 5% salary increase, as well as some other state revenues and technical adjustments. Total revenue revisions are revised upward by about $1.4 million. On the expenditure side, we also propose making some revisions here  They are listed and summarized in this table. We propose to change the classified salary increase from 2% to 4%, increase the teacher salary raise from 5% to 5.2%, expand the STEP program, and make further FTE restorations. In addition, this is partly offset by technical adjustments that have been made as we continue to refine the budget.",

    "text": "You might ask why just two schools?  rather than offer an extension to the current 15 afterschool programs? Well, it's pretty simple. Our objective is to address the challenge of providing extended day services to pre-kindergarten students while minimizing the impact on our ability to serve the kindergarten through fifth graders.  We currently have 273 students who are ages three and four registered in Bright Stars, Head Start, and Early Childhood Special Education programs. Now, here is our challenge in addressing the burgeoning need for expansion. When we opened the school year in 2019, pre-pandemic,  there were over 500 kindergarten through fifth graders on our afterschool wait list. The pre-kindergarten students registered in 2019 were not included in this total. So our bottom line challenge is finding staff who are willing to consider  a 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. part-time schedule with low wages.  This is also something that's important. Because of the required eight to one and 10 to one student to teacher ratio for three and four year olds versus an 18 or 20 to one ratio for kindergartners through fifth graders, we are likely to add 10 students to the wait list for every pre-kindergarten class that is offered.  And so another piece of information, this challenge will not be fully addressed until we can resolve the hiring of staff issue. The majority of our afterschool program educators are teacher assistants who really appreciate the $15 minimum raise. Mr. Reed.",

And likewise, it will open the doors to the world of possibility.  by allowing students to experience new and unique and rich learning opportunities.

And that's because it's a partnership between the Woodbrook and EDEP administrations who collectively oversee the programs to include the staffing, the identification of students, which will be determined by the criteria you see enumerated there, free and reduced lunch,  The adults in the household will provide proof of employment. And then finally, if there are more than 10 families who wish to participate, then they will be selected ultimately by a lottery system. As far as a mechanism to assess the quality of the program, we'll look at things like the student's attendance record, discipline referrals,  students growth and self-confidence and level of independence, academic performance, and a parent survey, and a teacher survey for those teachers who are working directly with the program. There'll be many similar criteria and elements for the Mountain View program.  However, the Mountain View program will be under direct oversight of the school administration. Staffing will be similar, identification of students will be similar. As part of the planning process already in the works for the Mountain View program, we are including five Saturday enrichment opportunities in conjunction with parent and child workshops offered through a partnership with the Bright Stars Family Support Worker.  Additionally, as part of this program, students would be afforded transportation home. The evaluation components are identical. So in summation,  I wanna say we want to assist the students in evolving their personal response to the essential questions. How do you define success? And for these little guys, we're gonna sort of extrapolate the question, what is a happy life? And as they get older, then that question will evolve to what does it mean to have a rich full life? Ralph Waldo Emerson states, some pursue happiness, others create it.  In Children Through Action, students will build self-confidence and develop self-awareness so they can create their own happiness.",

We'll look at their academic performance, potentially in comparison to a control group of peers within the building who are not participating in the program. Things like their attendance record.  What does it look like in comparison with their control group? Is their attendance better, worse, about the same? Parent feedback is going to be significant. We want to hear from parents about their perception and assessment of the program, the quality of the kids' growth, how they interact with their peers, for example, their siblings at home, and then feedback from their teachers is going to be critical.

    "text": " So the two different concepts will be evaluated by the different features that they offer. So in one school, it will be an extension of the extended day enrichment program where the principal will continue to collaborate with the director of services. Now, what we'll be able to look at there is not  hiring an additional staff person who is qualified to teach whereby the majority of that person's time will be spent in that school working directly with the students who will be in the extended day enrichment program. No, I'm sorry. Well, that's true too. And so with plan B,  We are going to allow a lot of options in terms of hiring a full-time staff person, as well the hours of the day. So with that program, we may see a schedule for a teacher who may begin his or her day two hours later than the regular teachers.  so that he or she could pick up two hours with extended date enrichment. So we'll be able to compare  how difficult it may be to hire someone with that sort of modified schedule, how staffing will be used in the school, where it's a combination between extended day enrichment and supervision directly under the control of the principal for providing direct educational responsibilities  for the student from the beginning of the day through afterschool care. In addition, that second model will allow us to engage families through a Saturday school program as a way of looking at extending learning opportunities for students, those younger age students. So there are a lot of components there that will bring us some uniqueness in terms of how we support students.  So we're leaving some flexibility with principles where concept A would run until six o'clock, concept B may run until 4.30 because we're concerned about three-year-old students or four-year-old students have a long day from 7.30 in the morning until six o'clock. So we have a lot of flexibility there in terms of comparing.  One thing that's missing, and Mr. Page asked me this earlier, what about the small schools, like in the Southern feeder pattern? The reason we didn't select those students, those smaller schools is because you may only have one or two or three students in those programs.  But I mean, after some thought with Mr. Page's challenge, that's something that we may want to consider. Because when you look at smaller programs, that's where it becomes complicated with the regulations that we have to follow. With like a three-year-old, you have a 8 to 1 ratio.  And with a four-year-old, it's a 10 to one ratio. But if you only have one three-year-old in that program and the rest are four-year-olds, you have to follow the regulations of that eight to one. So a lot of little moving parts that we have to play with and try to figure out. So these two concepts are designed to just give us additional information in terms of making decisions moving forward.",

    "text": " Our next item is our school board salary advertisement. And to sort of update all of our board members, an elected school board, such as here in Albemarle County, may pay each of its members an annual salary that is consistent with the salary of procedures and no more than the salary limits provided for by local government bodies.  The school board has adopted the procedure currently used by the Board of Supervisors in setting its member salary pursuant to Virginia Code section 15.2, 1414-3. Specifically, the school board will establish the member's salary by affirmative vote annually between May 1st and June 20th, or 30th rather.  Before setting a salary each year, the board is required to hold a public hearing and provide notice as specified by Virginia Code Section 15-2, 1426 and 1427. If the salary increase is approved by an affirmative vote, then the increase will take effect on July 1st.  Currently our school board members receive an annual salary of $6,907. The current chairman's stipend is an additional $1,800 annually, and the vice chairman receives a stipend of $35 per meeting chair. Typically, the school board increases its salary by the same increase provided to classified staff.  If the board follows the same increase as classified, then the salary beginning July 1st, 2021 would be $7,183. So what we need to do in a motion tonight would be to direct the board clerk to advertise for public hearing a school board member salary of $7,183 with a chairman stipend of 1,800 and a vice chairman stipend of $35 per meeting chair.  We need a motion to that effect.",
