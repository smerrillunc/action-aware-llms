    "text": "Thank you. Judy's gave me the clue. Thank you all. I just want to call this June 19th special meeting of the Albemarle County School Board to order. And we are scheduled to go through until 1 o'clock. We have two major topics for this morning.  And the first is the return to school plan, the draft. And I think that's going to be extremely important for all of us, because not only does this give us a chance to kind of drill down, but it also can impact decisions that we make regarding the school calendar.  And so I think this is going to be of great value. And then the second session, I will probably take a break in between, will be on SROs. And I'm very much looking forward to that. I got the printout that everybody got in the email last night and just printed it off. So I'll be kind of looking at that as we go.  One thing that I would like to note is that I am sorry that Dr. King can't be with us today. We hope that he recovers quickly and that he can be part of our discussion next week.  I know that Ms. Gildner, probably Dr. Haas, and others will be able to fill in for Dr. King, but I think his voice is a really important one to this discussion.  So with that, it is truly my pleasure to turn this over to Allison Linney. Allison, we're glad you're with us again, and I look forward to today, and take it away.",

And I have been watching your meetings since the beginning and just wanted to say how incredibly impressed I am by how you all are managing this time and the kind of engagement that you're having. And so  It's a true pleasure. I think I've been working with you all for about five or six years in different forms or fashions. So it's just a delight to be back and to help you have this conversation. So, you know, I watched yesterday's meeting as Jono told everyone. And one of the things that is on my mind is that I know you have this incredible document that the staff has put together. I also know we've got the staff available to us as we want to have them in the engagement of our conversation.  And so what I wanted to propose and what Jono recommended is, you know, really what do we want to accomplish? So I'd actually like to set a few objectives with the school board for this portion of the conversation. So my general goal is to take about two hours to help us talk about the fall and the back to school process, and then save about two hours for the SRO. Jono, have I got that right?",

Okay, so we are taking a look at that document. And I think that for the four sections set us up pretty well in terms of being able to say that's about the chunks of time that we'd like to have A couple of other ground rules that I want to tell you. I remember from last time was that your preference is that we stay as a whole group that we not do as much breaking into breakout rooms.  Everybody give me a thumbs up on that if that's where we still are. At the same time, if at any point it seems like it would be useful to break into pairs to talk, we can do that as well. I have the breakout room functionality that we can use as we proceed, okay? So I think part of what we'd like to do, I watched yesterday's presentation. I understand who are the different leadership sponsors within the staff.  in terms of the different sections. And I think we're well off to start with healthy environments and have a robust discussion about that. But I'm also open to just pausing for a moment, see if anybody wants to come off mute and say anything sort of overarching, if you feel that I'm diving in too quickly.

Anything they read in there that they'd like to make sure they understand before we have a discussion?

It's mentioned in the statement of the areas of focus, but I don't really see a lot of discussion about, you know, the problems with recycling air that can carry the virus. And then also I had a question about hand washing in terms of how frequent it's being done.  I watched the EAB webinar about best practices for returning to school, and they suggested doing hourly hand washing. And I don't see that in here, just entering and exiting rooms. And I don't know how often our particularly elementary school children who are in the same classroom all day will be entering and exiting.

So we are sharpening the pencil and just being very creative in all of our transportation pieces of it to give instruction as many opportunities to develop a viable schedule. So it's one of those non-answers right now. We are working on it.

A couple of things. First is we would obviously, our custodians do other things other than clean. They're moving things and other work orders. And so the first step is to prioritize that. Their main focus would be cleaning and disinfection. And so there may be some decreased service levels of other things. So that's the first.  The second is we have both daytime and evening custodians. And so we can do some labor, some shifting around to better support in the daytime for more frequent cleaning. And the last piece I'll add is we are looking at schedules that would may or may not have every school in the building at the same time.  And so for instance, so that allows us to double up more or less custodial staff at one school while another school is not there. So we would obviously exhaust all our internal things. We're not, I'm not seeing a need for external yet, but if we get there, we would obviously pursue that.",

Debbie, I think that's probably what they said. Yes. And are some health officials often say that they'll they'll spike the fever later in the day, not first thing in the morning.  and then concerns about the accuracy of the infrared thermometer. So we know that taking temperatures may make people feel better, and it's a very visual thing, but we don't know the effect, you know, how much we're actually achieving by doing that. And then counter to that, you have a lot of logistical challenges. By taking the temperature at the front door, you have now gathered  people, which is what you don't want to do. And then if you take temperatures as they get on the bus, let's take the scenario. OK, so you have a kid that does have a fever at the bus stop. What do you do? Do you leave them at the bus stop?

So normally in every school year, your athletic teams come back well before your students. So one of the things that I've been doing is working with our athletic directors, Amy Boyer, who's our representative from ACAC and our athletic trainers, looking at the National Athletic Association norms, National High School Athletic Association norms,  and local information that's been coming out from both CDC and VHSL and putting together procedures on what  practices may look like if we're able to get to that point. One of the things that we would do is maybe on the first time that a student came to a practice, we would actually go through the self-check with them, actually take their temperature the very first time to show them and guide them through what a self-check would look like, what kind of questions they should be asking themselves,  and what to do if they are worried about a cough or the different symptoms that may present themselves if they are symptomatic.

And the other encouraging thing is they are very interested in a regional collaboration with all the school districts they serve to have a common develop a common response plan. In conjunction with the health department school districts and some local pediatricians.  and to develop a common response plan that would be publicly shared with our community before school starts.

Is that something that they are planning to do? We're developing a list of questions that will become guiding questions that our supervisors will work with their staffs on to determine what their actual needs are. This is something that once we have a better sense of what we talked about,  learning more about our students and who's coming back that will also help us help guide us with what we're going to need staff wise to support those. And from there, what we will do is one of the things in the document, it talks about some accommodation and obviously you know virtual is an easy accommodation or relatively easy accommodation for.  for teachers, but you're exactly right. That does not apply for other staff members. We've talked about, are there ways to reassign people to other situations that may allow them to do work that they may not have been able to do in their original job? And so those are some of the things that we're wrestling with. One of the things that I think is helpful to know is as we brought people back in for our first phase of our employees coming back into work, at this point, we've only had two people, I believe, that have needed to not come in yet.  And so I'm hopeful that I know that right now there's a lot of unknowns and with the not knowing exactly start date and schedule and what school is going to look like, I know that there's a lot of angst for our employees around that.

But I think it's going to be important for us to know, not the school board, you know, but within the system.  And I'm not sure where I'm going with that, but it's just somehow it's important that somebody be aware. And I know that we'd be sensitive in order to, in dealing with it.

I think this is very much aligned to with what Ms. Collins was saying about the work that we're going to work with our families to educate our families and help them understand  the importance of keeping your child home if there are symptoms. I think it's a very similar thing with our staff. We need to work with them, make sure that we've got really strong relationships, help educate as part of our coming back in training or onboarding, for lack of a better word, making sure that they understand the importance of being open and honest with their supervisors to let them know if something is going on.  I think that's a first step. And obviously this is something that we need to get much better developed as far as that process goes. But I, you know, one of the things that I have heard throughout all of this is that when people are more upfront and when they know that things are going on, that we can better plan and prepare for the actualities. And that's what, you know, we would do. And we will have procedures in place so that for our supervisors, when they hear something, they will, for a reporting process to help us out there.",

And so I've been advising my corporate clients to be very cautious about any actions they take against an employee irrespective of leave time or anything.  And I want to liken it to an employee who is theoretically at a nuclear power plant. And there is a nuclear release, a radiation release. Under the OSHA requirements, an employee is perfectly justified to say, hey, there's radiation. I'm not coming to work. And they can't be penalized for that decision.  It is unclear at this point, from my perspective, whether an individual, and I err on the side of caution, an individual with a justifiable, reasonable, and articulated concern regarding the safety of the work environment  is protected from any sort of job action. And so if I fall within a category, specifically if my physician says, Dave, you can't go to work, this is dangerous. I think that gives them protection under OSHA if they come to the employer and say, hey, look, I think I have an articulable concern regarding the safety. And so I just want us to be very proactive on that because,  I mean, you know, it's not something we typically consider, but I think it's going to be a big issue with a lot of places going forward.",

And then the next one is about people who have trepidation about coming back to work. And in those cases, they do not meet those other qualifying conditions. And very honestly, the main difference between the two is that one has the FFCRA availability of leave. The leave options are exactly the same in the other one. However, in the one where they have the qualifying conditions,  Obviously, FFCRA is an option, and then it ends with looking at some accommodations that may be helpful. In the situation where the person has trepidation, we start with what are the accommodations that may be able to help the person come into work, recognizing that they may not be able to, and then the leave options then are exactly the same. So to your point, Mr. Oberg, we really do wanna make sure that we are treating our employees fairly.

Just to give you another example with respect to accommodations,  One of the high-risk groups are the folks over 65 years old. I'm one of them. And that is not a disability under the ADA. However, for certain guidance, and I think we have also thought about including that category into those who could seek an accommodation, if not under the ADA specifically or legally,  seeking accommodation because of the high-risk group. So I do think that we have to be very mindful of folks who may come and say the place is not safe and explain why, and then we'll have to address it. How can we make it safe? Can we provide different PPE? Can we do disinfecting? They have to have more than just a generalized complaint. It has to be something that they can tell us that then we can... It has to be reasonably articulated.  Yes, I agree. And we're prepared to do that as well. As Dr. Cox said, this is on a case-by-case basis. Somebody may come with an articulable fear or complaint. We may be able to address it. We may be able to change schedules to accommodate that. We may be able to provide additional PPE for that person  But each and every case will have to be looked at.

With respect to in school, the guidance of the state so far is to recommend wearing of masks. We do have communities who may be very interested in having their children wearing masks, especially older children, and there may be some who do not. This is another legal  conundrum right now because the laws really haven't caught up to our situation. And it is, I will tell you, in many meetings with school board attorneys around the state, this is something that's being debated right now. As Ms. Collins pointed out, it's a recommendation to wear the mask.

So I actually, if we were having a normal retreat right now where our goal was to be together until 1 p.m., this is actually when I would give you a bit of a quick stretch break. And so I'd like to suggest that because I think that can really help with engagement and conversation. As you go into that break, here are a couple of things I'd like to suggest. One, do it as fast as you can, come back as quick as you can so that we can resume. But I'd say no more than five to seven minutes for this first break, we'll take another one  later in the morning. And then think about for me, what else is it that you wanna talk about relative to the last section of the report? And then anything else that we can give feedback to the staff about some of the questions that they have asked me to consider is sort of, does it feel like this is headed in the right direction? Is there a way that you would wanna see content presented  differently, does this feel like it is committed to the spirit of what we're trying to accomplish here in terms of the health of everyone and the system. So any additional feedback you have for the staff and especially what's missing, I know that's so important to them. But let's go ahead and take ourselves a quick break, get up, stretch. And Judy, when we come back, we'll start with you, okay? Great.",

So we actually, that one piece of our assessment, balanced assessment portfolio is well built.  So that's, I mean, we've been doing that probably over the last five years of how do you build a balance assessment? How is it not just a multiple choice and true false kind of assessment? So those tools allow us to do that. The other piece I would add to Ms. Kastner's comment is one of the things that's happening with the professional development is for each unit that the teachers are teaching, they are coming in with a pre-assessment. So that's a pre-assessment, not necessarily of what they're going to teach, but the foundational pieces  that should be in place as students go into that new content. I think you'll see a comment on mastery learning. That's best practice. It's something we've been moving towards and trying to get to. But this is one of those opportunities to magnify that and talk really quite well about what are key points, what is the student mastering in this, and be very diligent in our learning continuums.  The skills that are needed, but the concepts and the processes that are needed to are spelled out very clearly for students. Sometimes those are hidden to students, but we're working very clearly and consciously on making those visible.",

    "text": "So I would comment on that. I agree. I think that right now what we're working on is really just transitioning into dealing with what's right in front of us.  I was alarmed by what it showed in terms of the COVID slide, but I think more alarming is when you look at those same slide decks, you'll see the summer slide that occurs for students annually. And it's most impactful with students who are underprivileged. So one of the things we've been talking about at the cabinet level,  and we're starting to gather some of our own data around is studying our own summer slide and the annual impact that it has on student learning. There's a lot of mythology about whether or not underprivileged students can learn at the same rate as their peers. The absolute fact is that they can. There's also a lot of mythology around whether or not  the kind of instructional practices that we use for all children are as impactful with underprivileged students. And the truth is that they are. And looking at our data from a national level, you would see that during the course of a school year, all students make the same kind of progress. And in some years, in fact,  the quote unquote underprivileged students exceed their more wealthy peers in terms of progress. Our teachers are highly effective. They get great results with their students. And every summer, because some students have more access to continuous cultivation throughout the summer that other students do not, there's the summer slide. And so,  the students who have opportunities during the summer to enrich and extend their learning, come back to school with actual growth that occurs during that summer period, which continues to put them ahead of their marginalized peers. So there's one of the things that I would consider structuring into another retreat with the board at some point,  would be to start off by reading a section from Malcolm Gladwell's book that's called Outliers where he lays out in stark detail the impact of the summer slide and the very promising detail that if we take measures to eliminate an extended summer break by spreading the school year evenly over  of what we currently use as this agrarian calendar, but instead move to where we spread the school year evenly over the 365 day year, you can virtually eliminate that slide. It will level the playing field for students and provide multiple opportunities throughout the year for students to catch up on their learning if they need to.  and also for teachers to engage in voluntary professional development to deal with the needs of students right in front of them during that time. I'm putting the cart a little bit before the horse by talking about this because it's really something that we're currently just studying. Last week, I had a meeting with Debbie, Chris Gilman, Mark Leach, and also Sarah Duesenberry and Christine Diggs  because what I want to do is to look at our own data for Albemarle County schools and replicate the tables that are in Malcolm Gladwell's book so that we can show people that we in fact have the same kind of summer slide that other places experience. And I think we did land on some data that we could use with map testing in elementary school because that's given  in the fall and the spring. You need to have something that you can look at fall, spring, fall again so that you can see what the impact of the summer slide is. Because I know lots of times people have an understanding of something at the national level and even the state level, but they need to see it for themselves locally so that they understand we have some of the same issues that you have in other places. So Kate, I'm really glad you brought that up.  We've also done a little bit of preliminary research with the Education Advisory Board to get insights around how other high-performing school systems around the country implement extended learning time. And what I would want to avoid is a conversation of just something called a year-round calendar. There's certain branding that goes with that that can infuriate people. However, I think that  Talking about an adjusted calendar that extends over the course of a 365 day year is more of a recovery calendar. And I think that we would want to have that in as a tool in our tool belt, moving forward as a school system, so that there's that option for families, at least in each feeder pattern, to have an extended, what I would call a recovery calendar, because it's a fact.  Katrina was not just screaming in the wind. It is an absolute fact that our kindergarten students, first grade students, there are finite skills that they only really have so much time to learn and build so that they become competent readers later that without addressing  and accelerating and catching them up, they're going to be behind where they should be. And I do think that having a recovery calendar in place for four or maybe five years minimum after this will be a necessity. And then it's a question of once people experience a calendar that stretches through the whole year, I think in most places and what we've seen in the research is they don't want to go back.  So I just thought I'd put that on the table as a more of a futuristic topic of discussion. I'm certainly interested in hearing the board kick it around. Matt, I was talking with DJ this morning about that exact issue.",

One of the factors I hope we don't miss, though, is that it's not only going to impact our students and our families, it's going to have a huge impact on our staff. We have a fair number of staff who have jobs in the summer to supplement their incomes.  If we break the brakes up differently, it makes it much more challenging for those staff members to get that employment. So we're just going to have to go in with eyes wide open and assure our staff that we are thinking about them while considering this.",

That's a great point. So it's good to look and see what other places have done to address that. And, you know, as someone who came up as a teacher, I painted houses in the summer. I worked for Parks and Rec.  I did all kinds of stuff in the summer. I'm sure my school system would have much, if they had the opportunity, would have enjoyed employing me as a teacher so I could help kids when they need help. So what I would say is that it opens up more opportunities for stipending teachers and treating them like professionals they are and valuing what they know and can do. And so, for example, if you ran a school year where  You had three to four-week intersessions between nine-week periods. We could employ teachers to do the kind of extra time and support that we need for students to engage in enrichment with students. So that's just one example of how successful school systems have made that shift, Dave, and that's a great point.",

Some parents told us those enrichment activities were great, but I the motivation for my child to do them.  was not so great. And a teacher helping with that could help. So we're offering parents, if you'd like to have a teacher call your child once a week and talk with them about which activities they're doing and how that's going. It's kind of a project mentality. We're offering parents that. So those are two options that we're offering that we've never offered before. And then we're offering the same invitation summer school for students that we had identified as  not reading on grade level in March. So we'll be inviting those students in, we're gonna be doing virtual tutoring. So you would have a time that I would call you and we would do a tutoring session through Zoom, et cetera. So those activities are already happening and we are extending those times to four weeks. Usually we do about, I don't know, two weeks, four hours. So we're trying to think about extending that  and having more contact than we might necessarily had. So, and those are one-on-one sessions or small group, depending, the school-based intervention teams are making those kinds of decisions. So that's up and running this summer.

So we can look at those scores and say, you know, if a child is, typically if a child is reading on or above grade level, they are passing SOL scores in general, and actually pretty clear on that. So we have some parallel assessments that we can use to determine where students are. We also can, while it's hard to compare cohorts, over time we can say, our fourth graders were reading  70, 80, 90% of them were reading at this level. So we can begin to compare cohorts. Those benchmarks are very clear for grade levels so that we know if a child's reading above, on, or below grade level. So we have those kinds of pieces in place for elementary schools and then map in place for middle schools.",

I think one of the important things I know Matt has reiterated to me is how much all of you are welcome to cabinet meetings. I mean, we have to alternate how many people can be there and things like that. But Matt, one of the things we may do is think about how we  continue to let people know when particular topics might be a focus of the cabinet meeting. Debbie, you might be able to help folks think about sort of how we communicate that. But I think those of you who've told me you've gone to cabinet meetings have really appreciated the opportunity to kind of dive down with the cabinet. But with that being said, kind of closing comments about the report to date, where you celebrate it perhaps, where you might  look for more. Just give each board member a chance to maybe say something there. Dave, you get to go first, buddy, because you're in the top left-hand corner of my screen.",

There will be an uptick with having that number of students coming back and also all the staff that are associated with them and all the various people that are in support roles at UVA. My sense from what I've been taking away from the Virginia Department of Education weekly meetings that we've had is right now the plan from the governor's office is to say,  you know, at some point we're going to be in phase three and we don't have a phase four. It's phase three and then it's every man for yourself. And, um, so school systems are going to be trying to figure this out. Uh, the, the role of the, of, of the governor's office in closing all the school systems in Virginia, I,  I don't know how this sounds, but it wasn't about schools. It was about flattening the infection curve so that hospitals had time to catch up on the cases during a scenario where the federal government was lacking in terms of providing testing and all the other things that we needed. So it was not about schools. It was about flattening the curve for Virginia. I think there's a lot of celebrating going on right now that the curve got flattened.  And so it's like, OK, so now you're going back to school, make up your plan. Our plans are not going to be approved by the Virginia Department of Education. They're going to be read. And they're going to provide feedback to us if they feel like there's some aspect of the plan that we haven't covered. So it's going to be, you talk about challenges.  There's certainly all the technical challenges and all the pieces. I think our staff has done an outstanding job of addressing. Then there's just going to be the part about the community in a situation, again, very similar to where we were in March, where there will be infections, there will be issues presented with that.  How will we move forward? And I think our best bet is to continue to work very closely with the Thomas Jefferson Health District and work with them to do what's best for our students, our staff, and our families. So that's kind of my overarching look at it is that we're now  We're now holding the ball. Every school system in Virginia, all 133 of us are going our ways, and we're going to try to figure it out. That's kind of how the VDOE works in terms of how they do things.",

But I do want to end on a positive note and say, there's a lot of good things that I think can come out of this in terms of exploring online learning, offering new options and new ways for our kids to access information. And so while this is not ideal by any sense of the word, I think it's neat, I guess,  No, that's the wrong word.

So first of all, thanks to everyone for the fluidity in what we're doing here. We touched base during the break. And because of what we're learning about wanting to wait until we have Dr. King to be with us, we are going to go ahead and proceed with what I suggested about each of you having a chance to give your comments about the SRO and also any instruction to the staff and others for how to frame up the strategic nature of the conversation.  But the PD that I had planned for us was really an opportunity to talk with you all such that you, to the extent that you're open to this, to talk with you a little bit about how you're doing, how you're functioning during this time, how you feel about how things are working for you as a school board member. And so when we do that, when we talk about your personal lives, we are actually permitted to go into a professional development team building situation.  And so at the point at which we shift into that, we will go on off the public live stream because you too have protections when discussing your personal lives and sort of how you're doing during this time. So we will do that. And then we will also consider additional PD next week, depending on how we have to adjust next week's schedule to talk about some of the other items that we discussed earlier in today's meeting.  So thanks to everyone for flexing with us on this. I had to check that with Ross and Jono during the break. Ross, did I get that properly, please?",

And I, I understand this difference in our agenda today, but I do want to register my frustration that what was a two hour discussion was changed to two and a half minutes with just 10 minutes of notice.  Um, and it really goes to a feeling that I have about our meetings in general, in which we are often surprised with detailed information, uh, that I personally would like more time to process, um, and give thoughtful feedback on, um, so, and I know that we will discuss our meetings in PD at some point, so I'll have comments then. Secondly, um,  Where I am right now, I really urge us as a board to not look at our county as somehow immune to nationwide issues. I've gotten that feedback from a couple of folks and I recognize that we prioritize being an anti racist division and I applaud us for that. But we do still have the same stubborn outcome gaps as do other divisions. And as you saw also on the data that I sent last night, we still have  the same types of issues with placing police where there are more lock and bound students. The daily progress has reported, um, that we have the same types of disproportionate minority contact and Elmore County as do other municipalities. So I really urge us not to disregard nationwide research as something that we think just doesn't apply to us. Um, thirdly, I really appreciate the speed with which the staff has been able to bring together.  a review, but I again caution us on mistaking a lack of problems in a survey over the summer to meaning a lack of issues. And Mr. Oberg mentioned this before. So I'm also curious, because I did not catch this yesterday about how this stopped being an independent review. It still feels like we're looking from the inside.

Jono and I attended a  educational law conference four years ago, about the same time there were some Department of Justice and other reports about disturbing reports about how SROs were implementing discipline and perhaps a disproportionate application of that discipline to some of our minority students.  I did meet and Jono and I met but I met also with Matt and multiple members of our Staff to look at what our MOU looked like and I have to say it is It didn't look very good to me four years ago. It was not very specific about what we wanted to accomplish Having said that we've gone now to superintendents to police chiefs to lawyers. We have a very  good SRO contract, but that does not, or draft MOU, that doesn't answer the foundational question of whether the SRO or what roles. I think it's very easy to get caught up in the visible presence of the police in the schools. And I'm concerned with that as well.  encroaching in the areas of discipline, but there are layers of connectivity between the schools and the police department that are not, don't require that.

    "text": " So I would echo the frustration that Judy shared in that it is rough. I was expecting a more robust, longer conversation. I certainly didn't prepare a statement, a two-minute statement that's going to encapsulate all my views. But to try, now that I have about two minutes left, speaking to Kate, I know we have put work into our MOU. The piece that's missing for me is the accountability piece. No matter how much we rework our MOU and say things that sound good,  and what we want to accomplish. We're not checking if that's what we're accomplishing. Something that comes to mind is the D.A.R.E. program, which I went through as a kid and maybe some of you did as well. And then when they actually looked at it 10 years later, they found out it was increasing drug use because we were going into our middle schools and talking about the effects of drugs. And so and kids were like, oh, that sounds interesting. Let me give it a try. And so with with having officers in our school, it's something that is that we spend money on.  that we've put a lot of thought into, and we're not having that last piece of just what is the actual effect. And personally, I don't have the data in front of me yet, but my inclination is to think that the program needs to be reworked, re-envisioned, or eliminated if it's not working. I've had people write in that said SROs don't break up fights unless they happen to be right there when it's happening. It's still teachers who are doing it.  They don't stop school shootings. If they're serving an investigative role, which seems to be what I'm imagining they are, then we still are capable of calling the police and having them come. So I just think it's something that is ripe for review. And to be perfectly transparent and honest, I think there's been some frustration because I think a feeling is coming across that we're not going to be giving it a truly  from the ground up and unbiased kind of review. It's seeming like we're sort of painting a picture of  It's seeming based on our statement and the things that are being said that we're kind of lining ourself up, teeing ourself up for the SROs are okay. When really I think it's totally okay to re-envision and there could be other things we do. There don't necessarily have to be police in our schools. They could be in a central office. They can be reduced. We could secure, there's just so many options. And I just want to make sure that we're all coming with a blank piece of paper when we go through this review of the program. And it hasn't necessarily felt like that to me.",

Object to having a police officer being a quote school official.  and all of that entails. I think that the police department can be useful in helping us evaluate buildings and procedures and physical safety issues. But again, that doesn't require a police officer to have a continued presence on school property. I think there may be occasions where it's appropriate to invite someone from the police department on site for educational function, and that's fine.  I would like an independent review of our program as long as it can be concluded in time for the next school year. And I was assuming that it would be a statistical review and not an anecdotal one requiring retelling of personal experiences because I don't think it's right to ask people to relive trauma. I've done a little bit of academic research on SRO programs and I've not found  instances where they, those programs do what everybody assumes that they're doing. And that's just not here, read this article kind of thing. You know, these are real studies. So I think also that our continued language around quote amending the MOU  is not helpful because the MOU has a starting point of officers on site. And I think we just need to reimagine our relationship with the police department and what that looks like.",

We have to have frequently physicians, paramedics, but we don't have those on site all the time. If there's an emergency, if a child breaks his arm, which is much more likely than something like a school shooting,  We call the paramedics, and we get we get emergency treatment there so I don't think it's, I don't think it's a binary issue that hey look we, you know, we either have them on site or we don't have a relationship. I don't think that that's that's that's valid.  I got a very kind of upsetting email from a parent yesterday evening who basically said, look, you know, you're endangering our children and you don't care about our children. And if there's a shooting, then it's your responsibility. And first of all, I don't think that SROs have been shown to eliminate shootings. I just don't. There's no evidence of that.  But I think it is our responsibility to the extent that our children are suffering. And if you don't like the term violence or microaggressions what have you if our children are any of our children are suffering.  anxiety or upsetness because one of our police officers are there, that is our responsibility. I mean, that's our decision. And so I think we have to be very, very concerned about that. I'm getting waved at. Do the dance. I'm not going to stop until you do the dance. My gut instinct is that we don't need police officers in the building.  But if I'm wrong, I can be educated opposite. It's just where I am at this point.",

    "text": "Like everybody else has said, I've been sort of torn too.  with all of the information we've received. We've received a whole lot of emails saying that the SROs have to go. We've received a whole lot of emails that have said that they have to stay. And one thing that really concerned me, I guess, with the program is when a lot of those emails cited the fact that a whole lot of our black and brown kids are just traumatized by the presence of the cops in the schools.  And I can sort of see that in a way, because maybe of some personal experience that some of those kids might've had, or even some of the things that they might be witnessing on the news, especially within say the last two or three weeks. But at the same time, the main thing that I've been concerned about is what do we have to do in order to alleviate that situation? I think as a school board,  We can't just say that we understand this is how the kids feel and there's nothing that we can do about it. But I think if we have a  in the MOU with the county police. If we have some type of statement saying that your main function is to come in and build a really good relationship with our students, so that our students will be able to see that not all cops are bad. And at the same time, we can't just be relying on the cops and school board to do it.  After seeing the demonstrations that have occurred, like throughout the world. We also have to have some way of letting people know that we need to sort of make sure that any cop who is racist, or any cop who is performing a crime that those cops have to go.  And if we are working with our students to let them know that not all cops are bad, and at the same time, in our society, trying to make sure that we are doing something to remove those bad cops, I think we'd be doing then a good job for our kids. We'd be letting them know that not all cops are bad, and that as they move forward in life, they'd be able to sort of recognize that. I don't think that we can let them leave our school system thinking that all cops are bad.  And that might be a really hard thing to do. But that's one thing that I think we have to do. And also, in relationship to the survey, are we going to get to that now? Are we going to get to that later? Because I see your hands are going up, but.",

I feel very strongly about the fact that we have an opportunity, and this is in light of what many people talked about and going back to what Kate and I have been talking about for the last three or four years, of setting up a new model  for our relationship with the police department. And one of the big issues for me is educational disruption, the environmental disruption for students who feel negatively about an officer being present at school. I'm totally fine with that removal.  And I do know that we're going to need to have some sort of a relationship with the police department. We have football games that they're at. There are other events that they are at. But we can do a new model, and that's very much in our hands to do. And that gets into independent reviews. That is in our hands to ultimately decide.  And so I think we should be going down that path. Accountability is one that I believe in too. And while there is a lot of good content in the current MOU, the draft MOU, there's a lot that can be taken out if they're no longer on campus.  There are a lot of things that could be molded in that, but we've got to have some sort of a working relationship with them, and that is really going to include an MOU. We have to get the data, not only from the schools, but from other sources as well, so we can make an informed decision.  And I do encourage all of us to come in with an open mind on it. But as I've said to a lot of people in responding to the gazillion emails that I've responded to, my goal is to set up a new model that can hopefully be in place before the new school year.",

I have to say as the superintendent, one thing I would say is that I don't know how this sounds, but we're not here to drag our feet or to slow things down when the board wants to act. I would  I would hope that as a school board, you would expect me to raise my hand sometimes and say, would you mind if we please provided information for you so that you could study a situation before you make a decision about it? So I don't know what else to say, except I apologize for just wanting to provide data so that there can be an informed decision about something that  could potentially be important. That's my job. If I jumped right in with everyone and said, let's call a vote tonight, I would think that you might think I wasn't doing my job. So I feel like I need to say that we're in a retreat. So my point of view is that I feel like I'm simply doing my job by offering a perspective for the board.  I would say that at any given time any one of you wants to make a motion about an issue you're certainly welcome to do that. I'm not the chair of the board but I would say anybody can make a motion. I'm not I'm not suggesting that you don't. I was asked in the meeting before last what my perspective was and I simply offered it. I'm an administrator. That's what I do. I administer.

That's what I think.  I detected from comments from board members earlier that there's a sense that we're, it's almost, I feel like an us against them, that we are somehow trying to slow it down as if I or my staff have some vested interest in keeping the police in the schools and we're opposed to making a change. That is not the case. I think I've made it pretty clear, at least in emails to the board,  that I'm very happy to shake up a paradigm that's existed in our schools for quite some time now. When I began my teaching career in 1990, there were no school resource officers in our schools. I dare say that the majority of the school board, if not all school board members went to schools with no school resource officers in them. So that is a paradigm that's developed over time.  I in the emails I've received from the public. I've been keeping track of new like new thinking that I've been doing based on the feedback that I'm receiving things that I hadn't really thought about. It's just become sort of like the wallpaper for me. I walk by it every day. I see it seems to be working. We concentrate more on having a good agreement and less on  really what the outcomes are gonna be or what the impact's gonna be. So honestly, I thought that we had made a good proposal to the board to put the brakes on for a meeting or two. We're not having school right now. We haven't had school buildings open for months. So we still won't have school for a couple of months. So I didn't really see the absolute urgency to make a decision at the very same night that the issue was brought up.  However, I honestly am a little bit confused right now as to what the desire of the board is. And I would like there to be motion and direction, very direct direction from the school board on what you would like us to do as a board.",

    "text": " I'm not suggesting to keep the current MOU. What I suggested yesterday was that Ross actually found a really pretty solid resolution that a board passed recently that it's not an MOU, but it would certainly serve as a way for the board to structure an outline of what you want to see moving forward.  I have, I mean, I'm just reading the tea leaves here and I have a general sense from what all of you are saying is that, you know, regardless of what we find out, there's a strong desire and there's a strong desire to not have a daily police presence in the school. So if in fact that that's like, for example, that's what the board decides after looking at the data, then that would be one of the first parts of that resolution is, you know,  Here moving forward, Albemarle County Schools will not have a daily police presence in our schools with a school resource officer or any other officer of the law. Then outlining the different parts of a relationship that we could have moving forward with the Albemarle County Police Department that allows us to deal with first responding  to situations that present themselves. I thought, I don't, I think it was Dave that said something earlier where he said, you know, we need, occasionally we need an ambulance at the school, but we don't have paramedics at the school all day. And occasionally we need, you know, different kinds of services from first responders that come to the schools, but they're not there all day. So it would be good just to, I think, lay out, how do we, how do we continue to do different things  It would mean, it would really just mean not starting from scratch all over again and re-articulating a relationship. Cause there are some pieces to it. Like here's, here's a piece that, that I think we're just going to have to figure out is that we do share information with the police when there's an emergency. So for example, if they're communicating with a, with a child  online or they're communicating with a child via phone that says they're going to kill themselves, we'll get a contact from the police, not me personally, but it'll come into us and they'll say, we need to be able to find this student. This is the information that we have so we can do a welfare check. And then we need to find the student for them because it's an emergency.  So that would be something it is spelled out in the agreement that we have with the police department. And that'll be something that we'll need to spell out in a relationship with a new MOU that we developed from scratch. So I don't, yeah, so that's what I'm thinking is I don't wanna do the status quo. What we would do is use what we learn and start from scratch.",

And it's interesting that some of the best facilitators I've ever known sometimes disappear for a while, and you disappeared for a little while in that last conversation we were having, which is kind of the sign of a true pro.  I'd like to thank Dr. Haas and his entire team for what was presented today. It was absolutely worthwhile in every way, shape, or form. And I want to thank every member of the board for candid comments, good decisions, and moving us forward. So thank you all.",
