    "text": " Good evening to everyone. I now call this October 22nd meeting of the Albemarle County School Board to order. We will have a moment of silence.  Thank you. Because of the pandemic, we are required to read this statement into our minutes. The minutes of this meeting should reflect that this meeting is being held electronically, pursuant to Virginia state law and Albemarle County ordinance, because the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impracticable and unsafe to assemble a quorum physically in a single location.  The meeting is being communicated to the public electronically through Zoom and streamed live on the Albemarle County Public Schools website. And public comment may be offered through the Zoom waiting room feature in accordance with the school board's protocol or by written submission. And also tonight we have another statement that we hope our listeners will be aware of and adhere to.  I'd like to quote from a paragraph that is in our policy on school community relations. It says in part, the school board recognizes the public has vast resources of training and experience. And I add perspectives that are useful to schools. The strength of our school system is in the degree to which these resources are tapped in an advisory way. And these resources are involved in supporting the improvement of our educational program.  Broad and diverse community engagement with the work of the board and the school division is so important that its value is expressly stated in the policy. Everyone is encouraged to offer their ideas, judgments, concerns, and questions about how well the school division is serving the needs of students and contributing to the health, safety, and economic prosperity of our community.  The live streaming of school board meetings office of that valuable opportunity to benefit from the voices of more parents, students, employees and community partners. Since the pandemic participation in school board meetings often has gone from less than 25 people to more than 1000.  We'd like to build on this growing community interest. Beginning this evening, those who accessed our live stream link will be offered a brief survey that will help us to expand our community outreach and contributions. Please take a few minutes to help with this goal. So if you are listening to our meeting, please take that opportunity at the end of the meeting, at the end of this session. Now for the introduction of our school board members, Dr. Kate Acuff,",

    "text": "Thank you, Mr. Page. I'm going to start by reading the public comment guidelines.  The school board invites and actively seeks the public's input in the matters relevant to school board governance and provides for time during its business meetings to hear from Albemarle County residents and community members.  As authorized by ordinance of the County of Albemarle, the school board will hold its meetings electronically during the COVID-19 pandemic. The school board is, nevertheless, committed to encouraging public comment despite meeting on a virtual basis. For this reason, there will be two ways for the public to provide comment. First, as always, written comments may be submitted to the school board clerk prior to the start of the meeting and will be given to all the school board members for review.  And as long as the school board member holds its meetings electronically, members of the public wishing to provide public comment during the meeting may sign up online by 2 p.m. the day of the meeting. Before electronic public comment starts, I'm going to announce the order in which the speakers are going to comment. Each speaker's access to public comment will be activated when it's your turn. Speakers will be notified when they reach the two-minute mark and at the three-minute mark. And that's usually just me holding up one finger when you have one minute left.  Speakers during the meeting are those submitting written comments should state their name and address our magisterial district and further speaker should limit comments or try to limit comments to those matters that are relevant to school board governance or the operation of the school division.  Lastly, although the school board will not respond to comments made during the public comment period, school board members may address comments at the end of the meeting agenda under other business. With that, let me pull up the public comment list. We have four speakers today. The first is going to be Margaret Lowry-Keppel. The second is going to be Michelle Drago. The third is going to be Amy Gertner. And the fourth is going to be Kenneth Martin. Ms. Keppel, if you are on, it is your turn.",

And I'm here tonight to ask that the staff at Albemarle High School, please follow Virginia state law and register my daughter, Elizabeth for the AP European history test. The code of Virginia section 221-254.1.f states school boards shall make advanced placement  preliminary SAT national merit scholarship qualifying test and pre ACT examinations available to students receiving home instruction pursuant to this section. The school board shall adopt written policies that specify the date by which such students shall register to participate in such examinations. School boards shall notify such students and their parents of such registration deadline and the availability of financial assistance to low income  and needy students to take such examinations. I have not been informed, and I've been homeschooling since 2004, so I've really never been informed of SAT deadlines and AP deadlines, which has not been a big deal for me because I just figure it out and call the school and make the appointments. But I did want to just mention that whoever handles that section of the  of the public school system in Albemarle might start doing that since it is written there that that should be being done. I do understand or have figured out that November 13th or 15th is the deadline for registering for the AP exam. And so there is some urgency here, hence my wanting to come to this school board meeting and mention it. I also have a private school student, a son who would like to register for the same exam.  Those are my comments. Thanks so much for your support. I don't know, accounting has always been really good to homeschoolers. So I'm not angry. I just want to move this along and make something happen. So thanks very much.",

    "text": " Hi, my name is Michelle Drago and I am a member of the right Vienna district. I've been a kindergarten and first grade teacher for 12 years here in Charlottesville.  And I'm here tonight to talk about the county's mask policy on behalf of hundreds of other educators that we have been in contact with in the last few days. On the Return to School website, as of 6.21 p.m. tonight, the mask policy said, students and employees shall wear a mask or acceptable face covering at all times, regardless of physical distancing, in an ACPS school building, in another ACPS facility, on a school property or campus, or in an ACPS vehicle or bus.  That was very clear that was very wise and this makes sense given all CDC guidelines regarding safety protocols for gathering in groups, and for state guidelines regarding masks and other closed air environments like Virginia stores or other places where people are congregating.  However, in a tab that is closed unless opened by the reader further down, it says students may remove masks and face coverings on a case by case basis for specific instructional needs or activities or is otherwise determined by a teacher, including to provide a brief respite from wearing a mask or face covering. In this event, six feet of physical distancing as approved by ACPS must be maintained.  That part is not clear, that part is not wise, that part does not make sense given CDC guidelines regarding safety protocols or given what we know we need to do in other closed-air environments. The two statements oppose each other. It is like a teacher saying, you may not tease anyone in my class, but you can if the teacher gives you permission on a case-by-case basis.  There is such a thing as wise decision-making and it needs to be done in a very clear way in a time where public health is at risk. The mask policy is irresponsible and reckless. The lack of clarity opens teachers up to complaints and different interpretations. Some teachers will be seen as the good guys who let their kids take masks off for a bit. Others will be the bad guys who make them keep them on. A student or parent who wishes to not wear a mask could possibly use the ambiguity of this statement to complain or overrule a teacher.  This puts the burden of deciding whether to enforce mask wearing at all times to each teacher in each grade at each school. That's not acceptable. Leadership needs to make the decision themselves. That is the only way we can try to protect our staff, students, and families. Right now, we know that that does not necessarily apply to certain students with developmental conditions and health conditions, and that makes sense.  However, we are talking about the broad scale and it says leadership is expecting teachers, excuse me, I'm saying leadership is expecting teachers to have to make the hard decision to draw the line on mask wearing. This does not feel wise this feels a bit cowardly leadership cannot hide behind the teachers and expect us to bear this burden, in addition to everything that we are having to bear now already.  If even one teacher is too scared to insist that all students wear masks at all times because they might be opening themselves up to disagreement. The teacher, the other students in the class, the kids who ride that bus, play with them at recess, and family members of all people who come into contact with these students are at risk.  Teachers will not return to the building. Some of them, because of this, if they know that they might not have students wearing masks at all times, despite the very clear wording at the top of the phrase.",

    "text": " Good evening, members of the board, Dr. Haas, and ACPS employees and families. My name is Amy Gertner, and I'm a resident of the Whitehall District. Thank you again for coming to hear the questions and concerns of members of this community. I'm currently serving as the president of the Albemarle Education Association. We are very concerned how the mask policy the AEA advocated for this summer is being presented. The wearing of a mask is not an option in this community. An indoor mask break does not keep everyone safe in a school building.  Teachers do not want the responsibilities of regulating an inside mass break. The AA officers met with Dr. Haas in his cabinet yesterday. A cabinet member suggested using an out-of-the-way corner of the classroom where students could remove their masks for a break. If you've ever been in a classroom with young children, you know that once one student needs to go to the bathroom or get a drink of water, go to see the nurse, all the students will need to do this as well. Are teachers being asked to consider posting a mass break schedule in their classrooms?  This would make sense if we were not talking about a virus that spreads through the air. Smoking sections in restaurants did not work to keep others safe. This is like proposing a corner of the swimming pool in which to pee. If this virus is present, it's going to spread throughout the room. Every child that sits or stands in a corner will be breathing and touching the surfaces in this area. Masks are what we wear in public. They're not optional. The COVID virus does not take a break because we're uncomfortable.  My youngest nephew was quite shocked when he learned he would be required and expected to wear underwear every day in kindergarten. Yes, every day. We learned to live with the discomfort of our clothing, clothes, coats, shoes. We asked the board to give us the policy with clear expectations of wearing a mask at all times while in our public buildings. We asked that you put the safety of our students, staff, and families first. I want the board members to know that many ACPS bus drivers are AEA members as well. They reached out to the AEA to advocate for their  regarding their safety. I submitted their questions and concerns and they were in yesterday's agenda. We were told Jim Foley would be sending an email to the transportation department in a day or two to address these issues. Some drivers are feeling anxious and discouraged because they feel their needs have not been heard or addressed in a timely manner. I want to end this short lesson with the toothpaste tube. Elementary students and teachers will recognize this activity. This tube is to remind us to be careful with our words  Once the words leave our mouths, they cannot be put back into the tube. Our roads are like toothpaste. There were comments made at the last school board meeting that were hurtful and educators took offense. I hope this will remind everyone to be kind and respectful to one another. We do have the same goals and responsibilities to keep students, families, staff in this community physically and emotionally safe. Thank you for this time this evening and for listening to the concerns of others. Thank you.",

I'm Kenneth Martin I live at 1120 meal Park drive extended in Rio district and I was asked to deliver this message to the evening to the school board from the NAACP. The album all Charlottesville branch of the NAACP supports.  The recent decision by the album all county school board to began on November 9 2020 phase 3 of the approved. The opening guidelines for pre K through 3rd grade.  We seek to ensure all students will have equal access to adequate instruction, resources and materials necessary for proficient academic performance as determined by the standards of learning. We seek also to mitigate the effects of the disruptions in the orderly processes of the Albemarle County Public Schools in order to control the spread of this pandemic.  Academic virtual learning is still in its developmental stage and it is mainly experimental locally. For this reason, every teacher began the fall 2020 session the same as first year teachers. Students, particularly those in the primary grades, are at the beginning stages of learning how to learn academically.  They can benefit most from their teachers employing the skill sets, experience and expertise they have acquired throughout their years of successful teaching. Of course, all students can, but this decision is crucial because successful primary years usually set the foundation for future academic progress.  Our branch of the NAACP is certain that you will employ the necessary protocols and procedures that have demonstrated success in other localities and that the necessary safeguards for the safety of students and employees will be in place when phase three begins. Thank you for allowing me to speak.",

    "text": " Yes, thanks Dr. Haas and good evening board members. I'm Pat McLaughlin, chief of strategic planning. And I wanted to give you two brief updates tonight. One on our school calendar and another on an opportunity in which many of our students are participating. First, our school calendar has been updated so that Monday, November 2nd is now a trade-off day for parent conferences. November 2nd will be an instructional day for students. However, all instruction will be asynchronous for them and our buildings will be closed to all students. There'll be no in-person access.  Teachers can use November 2nd for parent conferences or they may set up conferences outside of school hours and use November 2nd as a trade off day for that time. And as you know, Tuesday, November 3rd is election day and is now Virginia State holiday.  November 3rd was already approved as a non-student day and a non-work day for 10-month staff on our 2020-2021 school calendar, and that's now a holiday for all of our 11- and 12-month employees as well. Essential personnel who must open schools to be used as polling places on November 3rd will be granted a floating holiday that they can use at their convenience. A majority of our schools are used as polling stations, and with the exception of access for voting, all of our school buildings will be closed to staff, students, and the public on November 3rd.  And on that note, we were recently contacted by Michael Quinn, a volunteer with the Albemarle County Election Board.  Mr Quinn was looking for help finding student volunteers for the election day page program. That program is open exclusively to high school students and pages work in five hour shifts at our polling places from 5am until 8pm on election day. Mr Quinn worked with john hobson one of our lead coaches to get the word out about this opportunity and it gives me great pleasure to let the board know that Mr Quinn has successfully recruited 140 high school volunteers and of those 140 students 136 are from Albemarle county public schools.  Mr. Quinn reports that he continues to get between six and 10 applications each day. So this number is likely to rise prior to the election. I believe this is an outstanding indicator that we are indeed developing informed, engaged citizens in Albemarle County Public Schools. And I thank you for giving me an opportunity to celebrate them tonight.",

As you can see from this first slide, that these are some of the lowest numbers that we've experienced since we started presenting this data in August.  You can also see that the trends of all these numbers have been decreasing, which you'll recall means that over the last 14 days, each day has shown a directionality downward. The cases you'll recall are the number of cases per 100,000 of the population. Albemarle County, down to 6.4.  The next slide shows you Albemarle County's percent positivity, and this has dropped quite considerably. We're down to 2.5%, which is the lowest it's been in quite a while.  The next slide, the city of Charlottesville, you'll see that their numbers are still higher than ours, but they're a lot lower than they were, and they've been trending downward for at least the last two weeks. And the percent positivity of Charlottesville, you will see here, is extremely low, 1.8%, which is the lowest it's been since March.  So all of our numbers are looking good. And I checked in with the health department before this evening's meeting to see that we still have not had any outbreaks in any of the schools in the health district. And several of those surrounding areas have gone back, as you know. So I'm very pleased to report that.",

    "text": " So thanks Eileen and and as you all may recall from our last board meeting, the CDC recently released guidelines to assist schools as they plan to return students to the classroom. And these different just a little bit from the VDH metrics in that the CDC uses a 14 day cumulative count for case incidents, while the VDH uses the seven day average.  And you can see that the case incident rate in our area is declining, but it still sits in the higher risk category from the CDC. The CDC percent positivity is also calculated a bit differently as they use a 14 day average compared to a seven day average for the VDH. And as you can see here, that percent positivity for Albemarle County is down to 2.8 percent, which is in the lowest level of risk.  We left these dates we tried to match these dates up with when we get our updates from the Virginia Department of Health. But one thing I think is important to note is that as of yesterday, that percent positivity from the CDC had dropped to 2.0%. So, so as Eileen said, things are certainly trending.  in the right direction for us. And based on our current numbers and our case incidence rate places us in the higher risk of transmission and our percent positivity places us in the lowest risk of transmission category. I think it's important to note that the percent positivity has moved from the moderate level when we were with you two weeks ago to decide on stage three. So we've moved two full columns over in that metric in a positive way. And remember the third factor that the CDC identified  was mitigation strategies within the school, which are consistent and correct use of masks, social distancing to the largest extent possible, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, cleaning and disinfection, and contract tracing in collaboration with the local health department. And when schools implement all of these practices correctly and consistently, it lowers the overall risk of transmission in our schools, even when other factors are elevated.  We currently have all five mitigation strategies in place and we feel like we're implementing them correctly and consistently. It's also important to know that all four of these columns allow us to move into our stage three according to guidelines from the CDC and the DOE and the Virginia Department of Public Health.  One other piece of information I wanted to make you aware of is the launch of our ACPS COVID-19 dashboard. This dashboard can be found on our return to school page and gives information about any cases and outbreaks that have taken place within our schools or our departments. The dashboard is updated as cases are confirmed, but no less than once per week on our site.  And tonight we'd also like to expand our update a little bit by giving you some, some information on our progress towards stage three. We've received responses to date from 98% of our pre K through grade three families, and on average, 55% of our students have elected to return to the hybrid model, while 45% will remain virtual.  When we look at individual schools, we see that the range for families selecting hybrid was between 45% at our school with the lowest number of hybrid students to 73% at our school with the highest number of hybrid students. If you flip those numbers, you see the range for virtual. Our school with the lowest number of virtual students has 26.9% staying virtual and with the highest has 55.5% staying virtual.  And we also thought you'd be interested in the demographic breakdown of these responses. So the table on the left shows student choice by demographic group. So, if you took all of our all of all the white students who responded to the survey 55% chose hybrid and 45% chose virtual.  And the table on the right mirrors our equity dashboard. And this shows what percentage of each demographic group is represented in our hybrid and virtual models. So you can see that our demographic groups, this far right column is our total population for this current school year. And you can see that both the hybrid and virtual models mirror fairly closely the demographic breakdown that we have in our school. We don't see any great disparities here between those numbers.  with the percentage of students who are gonna make up both our hybrid and our virtual learning cohorts when we begin in November. And so at this time, I'd like to turn things over to Ms. Collins to provide some information about our K-3 schedules.",

And I wanted to share with you some information about schedules for K-3 students as we move from stage two, virtual for all, to stage three, hybrid for some.  All virtual students will have a similar schedule to the one they have now. The day is divided into an a.m. and p.m. section. One is synchronous with their teacher and the other part of the day is mostly asynchronous with their specials included. For our students whose families chose hybrid, they will attend school on an every other day cycle. Face-to-face will look something like the schedule you see in front of you.  While the order may change, the time requirements are from the Virginia Standards of Learning. The next schedule is the Learning at Home schedule, and it may look something like this. Students will have support during the day from teaching assistants or other staff in the building to complete the assignments that they were assigned by their teacher the day before.  They will also continue to attend synchronous specials like art, music, and PE. So we wanted to share these schedules. We had some questions earlier about them, and these are the schedules that we have given to the principals, the elementary principals, as samples to follow as they develop, as the teachers and principals develop schedules together.

    "text": " Thank you, Dr. McLaughlin. I'm Claire Kaiser, assistant superintendent. One of the factors that allowed us to consider moving to stage three was ensuring that we had enough staff for that in-person learning hybrid model that was just shared. This evening, I will share our current state around it.  When the board made the decision to move to stage three, teachers and support staff were given the opportunity to apply for accommodations to teach virtually. If you look at the chart before you tonight, what you will see is the breakdown of those accommodation requests. You may remember that when surveyed, our teachers indicated that about a third of them would be requesting a virtual accommodation. Our numbers of actual requests show less than that, right? It depends on the grouping and the grade levels,  It ranges from about 3% in the ADA for the whole school division up a little higher than that as we go through each of the different areas. When you look at the breakdown here, the first column is of the total teachers.  And we divide that into requests based on the request associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The non-ADA category includes individuals who indicated a need for accommodation due to being in a CDC-identified high-risk category. They may be caregivers or live with somebody who is in a CDC high-risk category. They may have childcare issues, or they may have just generalized concerns about returning to work.  Our total number of teachers gives us the overall perspective as our numbers did when we did the survey. But we also wanted to show the numbers broken down by those most impacted by the return to in-person face-to-face learning. And so there you see the breakdown of kindergarten through third grade classroom teachers, special education teachers, ESL teachers, and then our regular education and special education teaching assistants. You can go to the next slide.  The numbers are really promising. Ms. Collins and I have been meeting with our elementary principals for staffing meetings over the course of last week and this week, and now we are meeting with our secondary principals. And in those meetings, they are sharing their plans for how they will utilize staff.  Now that we have a firmer indication of our student numbers and the request for hybrid and virtual learning, we are able to determine what some of our teaching needs are. And I am very pleased to say that any of the accommodation requests for those individuals with  an ADA accommodation request will be honored in stage three. For our non-ADA accommodation request, that's going to vary a little bit school by school. And because the numbers vary and the number of teachers at each school who made the request vary. And so we are using a process that aligns very much with what we do for our reduction in force process, where we have a limited number of positions that our teachers are  that are being considered for. So we're going through that process right now. We should have that wrapped up by early to mid next week. And we are hopeful that we will be able to accommodate as many people as possible. We do recognize that we will not be able to meet everybody's accommodation request.  If a person's accommodation request is not met, then they will be given the opportunity. We hope that they'll come in. That's really what we would like them to do. Our principals will work with them to make sure that they understand the mitigation strategies that will be in place. And we, again, are hopeful that they will come in. If they choose that they can't, then we will continue the opportunity for them to choose to take a leave of absence, or they may decide to resign or retire.  We are very pleased with the way that our staffing has come forward with all of this. And the bottom line here is that we have the ability to staff both the hybrid and the virtual needs of our students in Stage 3, as well as meet the accommodation needs of many, but not all, of those who requested to remain teaching virtually. And we are very grateful and thank our staff, our tremendous staff, for their willingness to step in in both the hybrid and the virtual models.",

And I recognize that there are teachers, I mean, if I'm in Brownsville, I may not want to work on the other side of the county.  But are we going to have any opportunity to allow people to say, look, I'd like to go back virtual. And there's an extra person who wants to go back in person at Meriwether Lewis. Can we swap? Because if you're doing it virtually, it doesn't really matter where you're going. I understand where it's going to impact you if you're doing it in person. And it seems to me that we could make an exception such that it's not a long-term  replacement is just for this year, then you have a temporary transfer, and then you're automatically guaranteed to go back. It would make me feel a lot more comfortable if I knew that people weren't, hey, look, you just happened to be at the wrong school, and so you're going to be unemployed.",

I always debate, like, what do I bring up again that we're going to have a conversation, but I hope we make it clear to our teachers that we're granting it in a fair way that they're aware of how we're making these choices.

It is interesting that, you know,  not to confuse the two things because this is certainly not around RIF. However, I did think it was a really great fair and defendable practice that's not entirely based on seniority and gave us a chance as a staff to revisit it.

    "text": "Thank you.  Good evening, everybody. I'm Jay Thomas is Dr. Collins referenced and quickly the agenda that will follow today is we're going to talk about the high school redesign overview, the two pieces of the high school redesign that we're going to focus on today are the academies of all tomorrow and program of studies in specifically advanced placement testing.  And during the work session, we're going to ask you to make some recommendations back to the High School Redesign Committee. That's the work session that we're going to walk you through here in a minute. Now, we've got a team of people that will help be leading these conversations. I'll introduce them to you here shortly.  The tentative schedule will follow is this. You get to listen to me for about five minutes. And then we're going to break you into two groups. We're going to ask a group of four to stay in the main room, group of three to go to the secondary room. And we'll have two presenters. We'll have multiple presenters in the room to just give you a quick overview of your topic. And then after 20 minutes of you doing a work session,  those presenters will switch and you'll have an opportunity at the other topic for 20 minutes. Then we're going to ask everybody to come back to the main room for a few brief minutes and just give a brief overview. Then we're going to remix you into a different group of four and three and ask you to spend 20 more minutes or up to 20 minutes with your new group talking about everything you learned from those two sessions, the general overview,  and then finalize some recommendations back to us in the High School Redesign Committee as we move forward.  So as you guys know, are very well aware of our mission, our vision, our strategic priorities and core values and our anti-racism statement and equity statement. What we hope that you will see and the public will see as we go through the presentations today is the work that we're doing is tied back to all of these policies and statements. And this is what we also put in front of our families and our teachers when we met with them last week as well.  So when we met with our community last week, again, this is the, as Dr. Collins said, we met with them previously as well. The four learning targets that we worked with our school community were around understanding the big picture of high school redesign.  The academies of Abmar, what's the purpose and how are we developing those out? What's the role and implementation status of how we're trying to centralize opportunities for all students? And what are some updates and impacts on our program of studies? So we shared this with our teachers on Tuesday. This is the third time at a minimum that we from the central office have done presentations several times last year and then again this year.  And then we had our community meetings with our families again, had a nice turnout for our family community conversations, especially for being virtual we offered a five o'clock, and then a seven o'clock on a separate day option we had 165 families register and you can see the enrollment demographics by race here representative of who attended our meetings.  Just a reminder, right before we're getting ready to go into the breakout session. So the high school redesign, when we talk about the components of redesigning high schools, there's really five components. Facility and construction, which you'll hear about actually after the work session. Curriculum assessment and instruction. Natalie Farrell, who's with us today, one of our lead coaches, is actually leading a grading conversation. You heard from her and the team.  a few weeks ago around grading and learning management system, which is Schoology. And that's, I presented that to you guys several times in the past as well. So the two areas of high school redesign we're going to be focusing on today are the Academies of Albemarle and specifically the Program of Studies AP testing or the advanced placement classes.  So what we're going to do now is Natalie is going to put you guys into groups of four and three. So we're going to ask you which four would like to stay back in the main room, which three would like to go to the breakout room. The main room, you guys will start with the Academies of Albemarle. Jeff Prilliman, who's our Academy and Center Director, and Katina Dudley, who's our Lead Coach.  also support science, among other things. They will talk to you about the Academies of Albemarle, while at the same time, the group that goes to the breakout room will be led by Michael Craddick, who's our Center One Director, and his focus will be on the program of studies. So they'll each do about two or three minutes just overview of the topic, and then get you right into the work session. After 20 minutes, the presenters will switch,  We'll bring you back to the main room and then we'll go from there. So would you guys like to decide how you divide it up on the four and the three? Yeah, Katrina, do you have a question?",

    "text": "Thank you, Katina. Hello, all. I'm Jeff Perlman. I'm just going to give you a brief background and reminder of how we sort of got here. Really, this was something that the school board maybe set in motion several years back when  the vote around going to a center model. This is from the HBA F&I study, where we said, hey, we're not gonna build a whole new high school. We're gonna go with the center model to alleviate or address capacity issues. I don't think anyone on the current school board was around when the addition was put on to Elmore High School. But at the time, Matt Haas was a principal there. And his thinking was that if all we're doing is  alleviating capacity by adding seats that we're missing an opportunity to do something special. And I think the same thing applies here with the center model or that same thinking. If all we're doing is adding seats by adding centers and additional buildings, we're missing an opportunity to do something special. And so with that thinking, we started looking at the academies of Albemarle. We've researched other divisions that have done this. We've looked at school systems that have won awards.  We visited other school systems, talked to numerous stakeholders. In the spring of 2019, we started visiting our middle school families. It was primarily Jay Thomas and Patrick McLaughlin. That was around the program of studies, which you'll hear about a little bit, but talking to our parents about changes that would happen for their sixth graders when they hit 10th grade. In the fall of 2019 and into the winter of 2020, we worked with principals, teams from each school,  and essentially did the same activity that we did with y'all guys back in February, as Debbie mentioned earlier. More recently, we met with families of seventh graders, still with the anticipation that their kids, when they hit 10th grade, will be the first ones to participate in these numerous academies that we hope to offer. As it stands right now, these academies are based on the Virginia Department of Education career clusters. And our belief, and looking at the data,  is this is a great way to increase student engagement, specifically thinking about letting kids pick areas that excite them or that interest them, and to give more of our students an opportunity to take part in an academy experience, which we know for our kids that have had this so far that it's been incredibly powerful.",

    "text": " Did the new slide come up? Yes. Okay. So for the Academies of Albemarle, there were three bodies of research that we found to inform the decision on the creation of these specialized learning environments. We really focused in on opening opportunities to all students, leveraging student interest, and preparing students for post-secondary experience.  And we've attached the research to show and support that opening opportunities to all students is one way to mitigate the opportunity gaps that we currently have in Albemarle County schools. Also feel that by leveraging student interests, students will have choice over their learning and their learning experiences. And therefore they'll have some control and that could increase  their ability to, or their desire to take on more challenging work and more challenging courses. And then preparing students for post-secondary experiences. These academies will be designed so that all students explore career opportunities and other work-based learning opportunities as they engage in these particular academies and experiences. The questions that we would like for you guys to consider tonight  would include one, how many academies should be located at our sites within Elmar County. So we have currently six sites and how many academies should be placed within each of those sites. When we're looking at where to place academies, what criteria should we use to determine if academy is a good fit for a site? And how will we know if we get that right?  So what we have available to you tonight, either linked in the notes or just presented on the slides, our current Academy demographics at all six sites that have either an Academy or they're a site that hosts student learning where students travel from one building to another. So in addition to having Center One, we also have KTEC and we also have Murray demographics enrollment.  We also have some responses from our community conversation shared on a couple of the slides and some of the data we collected from that. And then of course, we've also included some of the research based on those three criteria that were shared on the last slide. So again, these were the questions and we're just interested to hear what you have to say and what you would like to share with us.  These are our current academies, and it also shows where those current academies are located. And then at our meeting back in January, February, these were some of the newer academies that we were considering based on the career clusters that are shared by the Virginia Department of Education.",

    "text": "So I can't even pull up the stuff, but I'm looking for that information.  I guess what I'm saying to start the conversation off is I'm incredibly concerned about the academy model. I would classify it right now, as harsh as it may sound, as a failure in my books on many levels, just because it's not representative of the student population. I think it is, in essence, segregating some of our schools. So as we continue to push forward with this model, I just...  And maybe this isn't the right time, because you're just asking us to pick which ones we want to do. But the ultimate, what's guiding me is.  How are we going to make sure that our students are fairly accessing this? And we don't have a track record to show that we've done it at anything. I mean, at KTEC, it's disproportionate in one direction. And at Murray, it's disproportionate in another. And I know I've asked very tough questions of Chad. And I know he's working really hard. And there's been no successful strategy that he's shown me where it's working. So that is what's top of my mind.  I don't know if this is the right time to bring it up, but I don't want to neglect that as we start considering where we're going to be placing things and and what's what is that going to mean, and I was for the board members who are newer who I can't see right now.  You know, this is a conversation that we brought brought up and I think even our thinking around it sometimes can be a little disordered because I mean we were talking about well let's put some of these what what I would classify as programs that are going to. I guess it's just factual programs that are going to potentially get you into a lower paying job, which is totally fine. We need workers to do that that appeals to many students, but let's put those in in places that also have like the math and science academy so that it's  equal, you know, I just, these are tough conversations to have. And I guess I'm curious your feedback and how you have thought about that to encourage to make it so we're not repeating our pattern.",

    "text": "I was the principal at Albemarle High School when we started the Mesa program.  And at that time when you had academies, I mean, that's what you did. I mean, you set up an application process and interviews and all these things. But the problem is, you know, now if I could have seen the future based on what's happened is that by having those things in place, you don't have a demographic representation from your students. And so one of the things that I've asked for  and will be implemented when we move to this model is to eliminate all those applications. The only kind of application we would have moving forward is just who are, you know, just who are you basically, not, and no prerequisites, because if you're building in project-based learning experiences that all students can access and be part of, then it really, you really ought to be able to have students participate wherever they come from. We put something in place at Mesa that said,  you had to have something like, I think it was geometry. And I won't take ownership of this, because I didn't, this wasn't something I did, but a decision was made that you had to have geometry before you could be in that program in the high school level. And that just really made things even skewed further. Now, the one school that we have been pretty successful with so far is Center One, which really has a range of, you know,  I hate to say, like, but types of students, a range of academic interest or, you know, like, so you have some kids that you might say would be on the typical AP track ranging to students that drift a little more toward an interest in career work. And we were very intentional because of the questions that the board was raising. And if we wanted to actually have a test bed or really a place where we could try to do things differently,  That was the goal of center one. So I feel like at center one, they've been pretty successful and we've also monitored their enrollment very closely. So if we start to see it go South during the registration season, we can intervene and find out what's going on and fix whatever issues they're having. So I think we can do better. I mean, we've got a lot of lessons learned. I'm glad you're passionate about not wanting to have these kinds of disparities in enrollment because  Believe it or not, that's not how it is everywhere. There are plenty of boards that are just happy to have an academy loaded up with the same students. And I don't know if you've been following the news, but Thomas Jefferson in Fairfax has basically abandoned all their enrollment requirements that have turned that into a segregated school. Of course, it's causing a big uproar there, but that's a good problem to have, I think.",

And it's a lottery if there's more kids than we can accommodate. But we're actually trying to figure out a way, can we accommodate more students than currently? The other thing I would love to add, because I think it's actually a big piece, CenterOne and KTEC have different demographics than our other academies.  I think because kids can maintain their base school identity and attend Center One. I think the ability to go every other day to an academy might be something that makes things a little more equitable, as opposed to right now, kids have to become a full-time student at Mesa, HMSA, and ESA.",

    "text": " Yeah, I can address that, Judy, if it's okay. So part of it this year was our registration was really kind of ramping up to finality at the same time that we went out in March. And so I do not believe reaching back to our school counselors and administrators, we didn't have the ability to have the in-depth conversations.  that we would normally have at that time when a child changes their mind about a class or an interest. So on the left-hand side, what you see is kids are interested in going to Center One for these programs. That's what we wanted to highlight there. And it is almost identical to our representation as a division. And that blew us all away last year when we saw that. Mike Craddick was a static. We shared it with Matt. And then when we got to the actual, all right, here's the schedule, we noticed this as well. So we've actually reached out to those kids and families to say, hey,  We just want to kind of learn, we're not putting any pressure, but what happened? And in some cases, kids were excited to come to the program, but they needed other things for graduation requirements that may have overlapped. Sometimes they actually had competing interests. I wanted to go here and here, and they just made a choice. And sometimes we didn't do a great job of following back up with the kid and family and really putting the supports in place to help get them there and keep them there.  So these are continued conversations. One of the things I do as I work with the school counselors, K-12, that we're having those conversations with them and the principals about how can we continue to support kids when they're interested in programs and get them over the hurdle sometimes. And this is one of the things that we did ask the families as well. If classes are offered on the AB, which our high schools now are on a common schedule for the first time, maybe ever,  It allows the opportunity for students to be able to maintain that base school identity, but still go somewhere else. So you're not taking classes just based on where you happen to live and what that school happens to offer. So we're hearing a lot more positives about that. And that's why we have the center one up here, because I think what Katrina is saying is, is it the heart of everything that we are trying to do and believe in? We want to have better representations, our principals, our counselors, our schools.  want to have better representations in our classes. And so I think we can do it and we're trying to be very systemic about how we go about that. So that's... I thought, hey Jay, I just want to chime in though.",

But aside from that, I would, one of the concerns I've had, and I've talked with Jeff about this a few times and Matt,  is having people being able to move in and out of academies or having not had. I mean, right now you have to decide when you're in eighth grade to go to Mesa when it doesn't make sense since our whole first year is supposed to be the freshman seminar trying to decide what you want to do. So I would hope there would be different pathways between or into these academies. Or you could take business and some math and engineering  an academy sort of create your own academy.",

And I think we all completely agree with it.  is that the students wouldn't decide on going into one of these, we call them academies, they're really pathways. Academy sounds flashier, I guess, but they wouldn't decide to do that until after their ninth grade year. So that's already a change that's been put into place in the model because that way a ninth grader, they can do the freshman seminar, they can get well-established at high school,  They have their legs under them, and they really have enough experience to say hey I think I just want to try this next year.

It makes it sound like it's something that it's not. And I'm just, honestly,  The reason that Murray or Mesa or all these places is because we've been like most school systems around the country that we talk about equity and pay lip service to it, but didn't make it important. If we had from the beginning, most of these places wouldn't be this way. And we wouldn't have students, you know, you've got the National Society for Black Engineers at Albemarle High School. It's the only high school chapter in Virginia.  None of them, well, I think there were a couple that were in the MESA program. If equity is really important to us all those years, then we wouldn't have the state that we have right now. It is now though. And if it's important and the board focuses on it and stays focused with it, and we'll stay focused with it, we can have representation in all these programs. We can. If it's really important, which it is, then we'll do it.  But as we know, whatever you focus on is what you get. And we have not focused on equity as a school system until very recently.",

And I think I'd have to, Katina's not here anymore, but I mean, I think, and the coursework and even the curriculum at the academy also gears toward a certain level of achievement that we've not prepared all of our students to have. I think there's a greater diversity in students and the range of experiences, say, with the Health and Medical Sciences Academy.  where students can be there and do, you know, students who are interested in being vet techs or students who are interested in going to medical school or being researchers, a whole range of things.

    "text": " All right. Good evening, everybody. My name is Mike Craddick. I'm the director over at CenterOne, and I'm here to talk to you about the program of studies. As you know, annually, we provide updates or changes to the program of studies for you all to review. This year, there are no changes to any adding or removing any courses. However, the AP limit is a change that is  will be part of the program of studies. So we have two questions that we would like you to consider as it relates to the AP limit. And first being, what criteria should be considered to determine the AP limit? And what number should the AP limit be set?  So with those two questions in mind, we've compiled a wide range of resources here depending on what you might be interested in diving into.  So just give you a quick overview of what you'll find in the slide deck here. And the other group found it helpful for me to post the link into the slide deck so you can access the hyperlinks and everything as we go. So I'll be happy to do that for this group as well. But as you click through, you can find a little bit about AP, what our course offerings are, and general enrollment by school.  The key thing I want to, one piece of data that you may want to spend some time on, in 2017 there was a presentation to the board with our AP and dual enrollment program evaluation. There's some key bullet points and I think this really was the catalyst for this discussion and really got this discussion going about  putting a limit on AP. We also have some research studies that if you're interested in the research around, there are some studies coming out, the student mental health is becoming more and more of something on the forefront of our mind, that there's some interesting research coming out around it. You'll find some response data from our parents from the other week, as well as statistics about our AP program, number of  number of courses that our seniors graduate with. So on this slide, you're seeing that 92 of our seniors graduated with one AP course. You can dig into the demographics and rates for AP and dual enrollments on that slide.  And number of exams taken is also available. And then this is where you can kind of really take a look at the impact of what a CAP may look like and do. This is just what we believe to be a balanced AP and dual enrollment schedule. As you read the program evaluation, you'll  you'll see consistent theme of that high stakes test is really, you know, that piece that preparing for it and taking coursework towards it is a real driver of that stress. So really balancing in some dual enrollment courses where it's more like an actual college course where you have the full course to earn your grade and earn your college transcript.  Balancing those in, this is kind of a representative schedule what that could look like. I wanted to throw out here as well to give you an idea of what it would look like to earn an associate's degree as well as a high school diploma at the same time, and the number of courses it would take to do that.  and of and this is just a sample of course you know you could substitute in dual enrollment or an AP here or there and then finally a case study of one of our seniors that will graduate this year with 15 AP courses on on their transcript and what courses they took throughout ninth, tenth, and eleventh grade and if there were a hypothetical cap of nine AP courses  How would that student have planned a little bit differently? So you could see the impact of the changes where they would substitute in and continue to have access to college level coursework with a AP cap in place. So with that, I'm gonna leave, turn this over to you all to discuss and take some time to research. And we'll also seek out a updated timeframe so we know how much time we have here to work with.",

Even the college board saying how many, how many AP classes you even have to,  to take to show that you're college ready and you can do college.

And so we have our dual enrollment colleges and that is a guaranteed college transcript.  It comes right from the college. Your AP classes, you have to score high enough, and then the college has to accept that offering. So there could possibly still be opportunities for kids to be able to take other opportunities. So for instance, BYU is a program that a lot of our families take advantage of to take AP classes online through BYU. They could simply, instead of bringing those back in,  with our limits on the AP test, they could send them right off to colleges themselves. So there's opportunities for them to still take classes in other ways, but what Mike was showing you a little bit ago is how we can offer these same classes through our dual enrollment opportunities as well.",

And they said, our teachers can offer curriculum at a high enough level that we don't always have to go through a separate entity, the college board, to offer these classes.

But still, the stress level that the student would be exposed to would be one criteria to decide whether or not we should reduce the number of AP courses. The second one was college guidelines, whether or not by doing that, we would affect our students' ability to be enrolled at certain colleges, whether certain colleges would look  and reduced AP numbers as sort of a bad thing. And then the third thing I think we talked about was the personal interests of a student.

Now the colleges oftentimes say to us the first thing they're going to look at is the core AP classes. Then if you're going into something that's a non-core, is a field in college, that's when those AP classes may come into play. So that's, it's a tough one. So  What we do is we do have some data about the number of classes that are offered both AP and dual enrollment in our different schools, low enrollment and again one of the things we're talking about with the program of studies, how can we allow kids to start taking classes and other buildings. So for instance, there's there's certain classes offered in one school but not the other.  So why can't a kid, now that we've learned how to do Zoom, maybe even Zoom into a class or go over to that school one day a week and take it. So we don't necessarily have to limit the number. I think naturally there may be a couple that are really low in enrollment anyways and just struggle to make every year that a principal may choose not to run that year. And that's reasonable because if there's not enough kids to support it, there's not enough kids to support it.",

    "text": " Good evening. I'm Lindsay Snoddy, Deputy Director of Building Services, and we're going to talk about High School Center 2 Schematic Design. Student capacity issues at both Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School have necessitated the need for additional instructional space. With that in mind, we studied our high schools as a 4,000-student high school system versus three distinct and separate comprehensive high schools, recognizing that all students should have the opportunity to participate in any academic program offered in the county.  Based on this, the recommendation was to use a village or center model to alleviate capacity issues and to modernize existing high school spaces. High School Center 2 is a 60,000 square foot facility with a 400 student per day capacity that is a resource for the entire division. It is strategically located to provide access to interdisciplinary project-based and specialized programming.  It will also serve as an interface between the school, community, and professional organizations that provide out-of-the-building authentic learning experiences such as internships and other work and community-based opportunities. The current goal is to open the Center 2 in spring 2023. Design funding for High School Center 2 was approved in FY19-20. However, funding for construction has not yet been appropriated.  Tonight's presentation is for information only. At the next meeting, we will recommend approval of the schematic design for High School Center 2 and authorization to proceed with the design development. Quinn Evans has their team here tonight, and they'll present the schematic design. And Charles Tilly will kick it off. Thank you, Charles.",

We're delighted to be here tonight to share the High School Center to Schematic Design. Thank you, especially to Jeff Perlman and Lindsey Snoddy and all the school staff, as well as Matt Workman, the county and all their efforts in guiding this process to this point. I know we still have a ways to go. I'm Charles Tilley with Quinn Evans in Richmond, and I'm a leader in our K-12 practice designing learning environments  And I have a long history of working with our county public schools. I'm joined tonight by two others on our team who've been instrumental in planning this project to this point Kylan Shirley and kind of wave your hand is an associate with quit Evans, then our project manager, also joined tonight by David Stephen with new Vista design.  David is an educator, an architect, and an educational facility planner from Boston. He was instrumental in the development of high-tech high school, as well as many other innovative learning environments across the country. David's been helping vision the architectural program and how the center would be arranged. Next slide.  Tonight we want to present three items, essentially some background and the programming of High School Center, of architectural programming, of all of the pieces that we put together to form the basis of the program, share the schematic design, elevations, floor plans, and those type of technical things, and then talk a few minutes about project logistics. Next slide.  For the programming of this building, we began the project using the high school facilities study that you guys completed in 2017. And through that visioning process, that visioning process that was done in 2017, the idea for creating centers around the county to address enrollment capacity issues, as well as equity and access was developed. Next slide.  In those discussions, the design patterns were defined that formed the guiding principles for development of high school learning spaces with the center, as well as other high schools.",

    "text": "All right, good evening, everybody. So the principles that we worked with align closely with the Virginia profile of a graduate, as well as 21st century learning goals that schools around the country are setting for their programs and students.  And these connect with not only content knowledge, but higher order critical thinking skills that students develop when content is applied to authentic context and problems that connect to the development of workplace skills, civic responsibility, and career planning. And I'm going to go through these principles quickly and talk about how they relate to the schematic design for High School Center 2 that Kylan will be sharing with you in a moment.  Please be aware that if you want to look at them in more depth, you have access to the complete set of workshop notes that can be found on the High School Center 2 website. So the design team conducted a series of three workshops that took place in the spring, summer, and fall of 2019, and engaged a group of about 20 ACPS administrators, teachers, and community partners. And the areas of focus included exploring 21st century learning goals for the state and district,  and their implications on the High School Center II facility, sharing best practice examples of school facilities designed and built within the past five to 10 years that modeled many of the design elements prioritized in the high school study, and discussing ACPS's particular school and district needs and priorities. And the highlights of these priorities include on the educational level, offsetting capacity overages at Albemarle High School and Western Albemarle High School,  Also creating programs that are relevant and flexible, putting discovery and innovation at the center of the learning experience and making it more visible. A focus on helping students to develop skills in collaboration and social emotional learning, incorporating PD into the process, and most importantly, graduating students that are thriving and ready for success in life. And community priorities included ensuring access to everyone,  and connecting to local business and resources and serving as a community have been resourced. Next slide. And during our workshops, we connected these goals and the high school study guiding principles to design features that were prioritized by the group. And when we think about community orientation and accessibility to all, we want to make sure that there's safe and welcoming arrival sequence, as well as clusters of learning within the building that build connection between spaces and that allow for  certain parts of the building to be safely used by the community after school hours. We also wanted to consider indoor-outdoor connections that allow for extending learning beyond the walls of the school. In terms of supporting the guiding principle of interdisciplinary learning, we want to make sure that the classrooms are agile and flexible and that they're also  extended learning spaces like breakout and commons areas that create these synergistic connections and support large groups, small group, and independent learning. Next slide. And to foster the guiding principles of life, career, citizenship, as well as student-designed environments that can be owned and customized by them, we looked again to providing multipurpose spaces that extend beyond the walls of the classroom  and provide spaces for flexible use and sustainability is also an important design focus as well as the idea that the building itself can teach students about sustainable energy use by enabling them to interact with and monitor building systems. And in terms of the guiding principles of mentored and authentic learning the building.  can support these by functioning like a high-performance work environment with varied and professional spaces, such as maker spaces and experimental and simulation labs. And finally, next slide, with regard to the guiding principle of transparency, we wanted to make sure that the building provides visible learning and connections, as well as good wayfinding and opportunities for display, exhibition, and storytelling. And next.  And we did talk to a group of about 20 students and eight teachers in two separate workshops about the kinds of spaces that most excited them. And what they were most excited about were the indoor-outdoor connections, maker spaces in a place that felt like a high-performance workspace, sustainability, and varied spaces with multi-purpose functions, including breakout spaces and STEM and STEAM.  Those were at the top of the list. And I'm going to turn this back to Charles and Kyla now to tell you how each of these considerations factored into the building design. Thanks, David.",

    "text": "As we came out of that programming initial kind of brainstorming process, we developed and confirmed an architectural program that described spaces that totaled about 60,000 square feet, which was our assignment, based on a capacity of 400 students and providing the flexibility to accommodate a variety of programs.  Next slide. And the way we've gone around taking those program spaces and melding them into a building, we see those breaking out into three different areas, instructional spaces,  and something we call the innovation core, which is really the technical resources that are focused around tools for various ways of making things or creating. And then the common spaces that support the academic mission, like administrative space, cafe commons, and those types of things.",

    "text": "Thanks, Charles. So we'll get into the specifics of each of those spaces a little bit more as we go.  and what they're like. But we started our task when we started schematic design back in March with trying to figure out, you know, how do we take that list of spaces and give it the qualities, the more intangible qualities that were identified through the programming process and those guiding principles from the study to achieve, you know, this ecosystem of spaces that work together to create the learning environment we want to achieve. So this diagram shows, you know, relative sizes of the different, the three different types of spaces we identified.  And early on, it evolved into this diagram, showing more how those spaces start to intersect to create that circulation path, that overlap that we need. So this diagram became like a guiding force as we develop design into floor plans and the building that you'll see as we go here. But first, we had to start with the building site. It's a really great piece of property over near Monticello High School. There's a lot going on there, a lot of connections to be made, and some really great views of the nearby mountains.  So zooming in on the site on this slide and flipping orientation now, you can see that access to the site is from Founders Place, which is right behind the fire station there off Mill Creek Drive. And it's a big, big hill. And that cleared area at the top is really the only level area on the site. The rest of it slopes and is forested. So, you know, we look closely at the, you know, hyperlocal climatic scenario there. But there are a lot of other factors that went into how we approach laying out the site.  One being keeping our development nice and tight, both to conserve economic or financial resources, as well as limit the amount of this forest and dirt we had to move. We also wanted to avoid having to extend any public roadways, that's a big cost, as well as work with that steep slope that's there to manage stormwater. So conceptually, the site started to lay out like this.  with the building up towards that level area, parking going down the slope, and stormwater down there at the bottom where it was kind of going naturally, and that left a lot of land left over to leaf force it. Another interesting planning consideration we had, and this was a request from the Albemarle County Planning Department, was leave a space on the back side of the site here for the potential to extend Founders Place and connect it to a new development, which will be down here called Galaxy Farm Place.  So just one more factor as we laid this out here is our schematic site plan, I can see the parking lot laying out there in front of the building as it slopes down the hill. And this is kind of the general mass of the building. From a vehicular standpoint and circulation to the site this reddish line here shows how buses will come up to a drop off area at this end of the building.  We're planning around nine buses, which is what it will take, we think, as if and when the building expands to 600, probably two-thirds of that when the building first opens at 400 students. And then the yellow line shows vehicular and car traffic coming to the site, keeping the two separate with a drop-off area at a main entrance on this side of the building that faces the parking lot.  Revisiting our diagram, this shows how that main commons area of the building sits over here on the right side of the slide in between the entrances. These innovation core spaces, what we see become the high-tech spaces, kind of sit here at the center, merging those common areas with the instructional wing of the building here to the left, and with plenty of access to the outdoors to connect learning spaces to outdoor spaces as well.  Here is how all the different program spaces kind of stack up in a 3D way, showing how the mass of the building is formed. And what became important here was this idea of this collaboration core, where the commons kind of extended through that academic or instructional wing, creating this space between. And I'll go right into the floor plans here, and we'll zoom in space by space as we go. But here on the floor plans, here's the main entrance.  and the bus entrance on this side, all the way to the right of the slide, with the administrative suite right there in between, giving them good observability of the site, the commons here, and then extending out through the instructional wings. The second floor really just stacks that instructional wing, and the commons is a two-story space. One of the main, or like really important comments we kept hearing over and over again early on was, we don't want this to feel like a school. This is somewhere different. It's unique.  So students coming right into this big common space right here, two story space, was a big goal of ours to give a nice big space. And we'll see more of that in a moment. The commons is really like the town plaza of the school. It's a place where, it's the dining commons where you eat. But it's also a place for events like a speaker, a visiting speaker from a local business or an academic. It's where a career fair, science fair might happen.  It's really multi-purpose space. A really important part of the space is what we're calling the share stair. And to the left of the slide are the spirit images, which are not this building. They're photos of different spaces that are intended to kind of give you an idea of the character we're shooting for with each space. So the share stair is really kind of crux moment in the building. It's the functional means of getting to the second floor, but also this wide open,  a place to become a place for an ad hoc presentation or performance, extra seating for an event. And it's right next to a gallery, a student work gallery. So a big part of a project-based learning environment is building this culture around putting our work on display and seeing that work of learning that everyone's doing. So it's a place where everyone's going to move through the student work gallery and really be part of the everyday culture of the school.  So that commons extends out through that gallery in the share stair and forms kind of smaller pockets of common space amidst the instructional spaces. And so these aren't corridors, but it's the circulation space, but they're wide spaces, creating different different size niches and spaces for students to occupy. It's student owned space outside of the classroom, outside the instructional space filled with furniture of different types and sizes to meet different people's needs and accommodate different types of work they might be doing.  interspersed in that space are group rooms, so more enclosed spaces for students to gather and do work outside classroom time, and then teacher collaboration spaces, which are really pretty casual teacher offices. Makes them available to students, but gives them a private place to go. The project studios and learning studios are really the core instructional spaces. We're not calling them classrooms. They're not your normal classrooms. They are really high function, high flexibility, adaptable, and agile spaces  Project studios are more intensive. Some of them will be outfitted like chemistry labs. Some of them like maker spaces. Learning studios are a little smaller, but still flexible. Flexible furniture throughout and resources like sinks and counter space and product storage in all of these spaces. And then operable partitions will be employed kind of strategically between these different studios to allow them to flex and get big or flex and get small.  kind of depending on the needs and as programs evolve and change. And then our specialty studios are the really hyper-specialized spaces like a wood shop or a metal shop, could be more high-tech digital environment like a recording studio or like a medical simulation lab perhaps, but that'll be, it's kind of TBD as we determine what programs go in here.  The idea lab is kind of the evolution of the typical library. You know, we don't need volumes of literature here necessarily, as it's more of a STEM focused center. So this is a place where students and teachers come together to access information, whether that's digital or analog. And it's partnered with this digital fabrication lab, which is a place where students can access technology such as 3D printers and laser scanners. It's that digital shop kind of space.  And there's no gym here, but we are including a fitness room or wellness room. And we think this is a pretty unique opportunity to address wellness and health from, you know, kind of all ends of the spectrum, from physical activity to mental health. It's a place where a student might go jump on an exercise bike, you know, for 10 minutes between class to kind of get that energy out or the workout in. You know, or there could be a yoga class, you know, first thing in the morning or at the end of the day. So multifunctional space to kind  view the whole student as a holistic whole and address health as well. And of course, the outdoor spaces are really important at a school where we're making a lot of stuff. So projects are big and dirty and messy, and being able to get outside is important. So on all sides of the building, these project studios and learning studios on this front side of the building have direct access to the outside. This area spills out into what we're calling the fabrication yard.  And even the commons spills out to an outdoor dining terrace. So giving students the ability to get outside, when you ask students what kinds of spaces would benefit their experience, outdoor learning always comes to the top of the list. So we've made that a priority here. And of course, all the educational goals are primary goals of the project, but we do have pretty aggressive sustainability goals as well. So I hinted at this as we talked about the site, but we're looking carefully at  how we're interacting the building with solar orientation, making sure we're daylighting spaces, managing solar heat gain. We're making a nice big flat roof so it's easy to add solar panels in the future. It's very straightforward install. And of course, choosing materials for embodied energy and recycled content and recyclability. So a lot of careful decisions being made there.  And what does it look like? So we have a couple of concept renderings to share here. Keep in mind, these are very conceptual. We're really looking at form and scale with these. So color palette is not decided. Even materials palette is a long way down the road. So it's kind of a hinting at those things right now. But here we are at the main entrance. So right in front of us are the front doors, the administrative suite to the right, a little entry courtyard here.  All landscaped and to the left are the educational spaces, the instructional wing, kind of out to your left with the outdoor learning spaces in front. You can see a large overhang here, which of course is part of shading the building and managing the solar heat gain and reducing energy use.  Here we are in the Commons. So right in front of us is the main entry. And to the right, we are looking up at that chair Sarah described and the gallery space. The Idea Lab is up here with a lot of visibility to it. And so we're trying to connect all these spaces visually and connect parts of the school. And then you can see down the hall to the instructional wings.  And now here we are at the far end of the building, that fabrication yard where these specialty studios, a woodshop perhaps, can spill out into the outdoor space and providing some covered work area for students to build those bigger projects. All right, shifting gears totally to project logistics. This is our project schedule. So pink circle here is where we are in the schedule. We're just finishing schematic design.  And this schedule has us finishing our construction documents in June of 2021 and being able to bid the project at that time. So potentially starting construction as early as August 2021. With the construction timeline planned for about 18 months, which takes us to March 2023, when there could be, I think, a soft opening of the building that spring and really fully opening fall of 2023.  So back in the summer, we did have a professional cost estimating consultant take a look at our schematic design and give us some cost estimate feedback on that. As you know, the project budget is $20 million. What the estimate showed was a little higher than that, but not too far off target. But what we really got out of this was a really great tool, that cost estimate, with a lot of data to help us inform our design decisions as we move forward.  and refine the design and make sure that we're making decisions that keep us on that $20 million budget target there. I did want to briefly note one of the things we asked for with this cost estimate, this is something that the design committee asked us to explore, were different options for heating and cooling systems. So part of the project we want to be part of or in line with the Albemarle County Climate Action Plan. So of course energy efficiency is part of that. So we looked at  two different variations of a geothermal heating and cooling system and got pricing for that. It's a more expensive system, but it is the most efficient system you can do. So we're showing here what the premium, about a million dollars for a full geothermal system would be if that's the decision and the direction we go with the design.",

    "text": " Right, and that that budget is not based it's based on descriptions of some things you know mechanical systems and that kind of thing.  And as Kylan noted, one of the things we're going to do as we start the next process of continuing design is we're going to dive deeper into the amount of square footage we have in the building. It's right at 60,000, but we may be able to pull a couple hundred out here and there, change a few materials, something that would bring it back partially  But I don't believe that we can pull out enough to get the full geothermal system into the project as a design, you know, part was a lot of part of a lot of that geothermal cost is drilling the wells.  There is a payback of roughly around 16 and a half years on that. The hybrid system, we're using a really efficient mechanical system to begin with, so similar to what you're using on plenty of your other projects right now, this would be a system-wide  a building-wide system, a very efficient mechanical system. But to get the full geothermal pieces into the project in the $20 million budget, I think we'd have to reduce the building square footage at this point a pretty good bit. Or dial maybe some site work back. We have 200 parking spaces on the site. There's an opportunity there potentially.  But there's some things we could do to do that if we were given that direction. I just don't know if we could get all the way back to 20 million with the geothermal in there.",

What environmental plan do we have in place when we speak to our, when we prioritize  the sustainable measures that we want in a new building. Because new buildings are one of the prime opportunities we have to build sustainable, environmentally-friendly buildings. And that's something that we've aligned as a county and as a school board. So I always kind of feel like I just ask, well, what are you doing? And that seems like something that maybe we should have prioritized. Our follow-up is with the, I know we're making space for the solar panels, but do we have a plan? I know there's power purchase agreements. Do we have a plan to get solar on there? And I guess I'm just kind of curious the process on that.",

    "text": " So as far as this building design goes, we've prioritized lead principles. And that includes, like Kyla mentioned, recycled materials, how you're laying out the site of the building, having a two-story building so we have a smaller footprint, making our mechanical system as efficient as it can be with whatever budget we have. Geothermal is kind of that next step forward, which does have a higher upfront cost. We got crozet. We got lucky because the cost increase for geothermal is offset by  and increase we'd have to do with the electrical service. So it made, there was a much shorter payback with the Crozet scenario. Here, it's new construction. The design committee made, I think, a great decision in not bringing natural gas to the site, even though natural gas is available for the site. So we're doing that so we can, as the grid becomes cleaner, the energy serving the building will become cleaner. And then long-term for the solar power, for solar on the building,  We talked about this a little bit too, the solar power purchase agreement is how we've done that at six of our schools. At Henley, we were able to get solar on the building through a grant opportunity, but solar PPAs are a great strategy for us to do that in the future here. Thank you.",

And I think with all the different areas, like the project studios, and I appreciated Mr. Shirley's comment about no gym, but definitely a wellness center, because that's going to be an important part.

That might be an opportunity that, you know, for, you know, summer or other types of the year.  But I would say by and large, it's the community gathering space that is there if other schools or other facilities aren't available. Monticello High School is right across the street, obviously, so there's large meeting spaces over there as well. But I would think that would be a good place.

So we've got the Tier 1 criteria, which is really based on seniority. From there, we go to licensure. And then we also, there's a calculation for it, the endorsement areas that they're licensed in, whether or not a person's on a plan of improvement. That's all the Tier 1 criteria. In the Tier 2 criteria, that's where we are looking at special skills and training.  educational certifications and honors and contributions to extracurricular programming, to curricular or extracurricular programs. And then obviously at this, at the elementary level, we don't look at the enrollment history and elective courses, but that is another piece of this. So that's the piece of the policy that we are following. We are looking at, we did do a Google form that allowed people to fill that piece in. And I'm going to see if I can share.  the messaging that went out to the group, to each of the teachers that we sent this information to. Stop sharing this.

And the reason for that is because we did not ask for specific information about those health conditions. It really is self-reported. And so there have been some teachers who have sent some information with doctor's notes and things like that. And we'll go back and take a look at that and see if any additional consideration should be given. But right now, we're really looking at just going straight through the process.",

And I don't know that all of you are aware that we did approve KTEC opening as hybrid. So many of its students of the programs require hands-on for students to get certifications. So that will be beginning in November.  Perhaps as early as November 9th, when the second quarter begins, it may be delayed a little bit because they're putting in a new air filtration system, which is scheduled to go in that first week, but that could be shifted a wee bit.",

Ms. Drago and Ms. Gairdner both mentioned and we've gotten a number of emails about the verbiage in our policy and also how it's being used. So I just, I wanted to put it to the board to talk a bit, to clarify a bit about what our intention is  with that policy in terms of keeping our kids and staff safest. For me, the new guidelines from the CDC designating 15 minutes of contact over a 24-hour period that came out yesterday or the day before, was it yesterday? It just makes me concerned about this idea of  respite, as well as the comments, you know, talking about expectations of teachers to set it specifically. And, you know, if that could be used against teachers, or if it's something that they would need to be managing on top of everything else as a part of hybrid learning. So I just wanted to get a sense of the board from that.",

I'm just surprised by it, that they took the perspective that it shouldn't be a teacher decision. That's counterintuitive to me. I believe in giving our teachers  the most decision-making in the classroom. But I hear the point, which is that  We know there are people who are not following the mandates. We know people who are following them very clearly and very carefully. And we know people who aren't. And if the concern is that, hey, look, Mr. Oberg, he's the cool teacher. He doesn't make you wear your masks at all. I think that violates the policy. It clearly violates my understanding of the policy.  But I get if that's the concern that, yeah, I get that. I can see that being a risk. I think the intent is that there are certain circumstances where I can see an emergency circumstance where a child just has to have their mask off.  I don't think we can list the thousand reasons why that may take place and the hundred where it might be necessary, which is why I think there's an advantage to giving the teachers that authority. But maybe the term respite is not the correct term, because that makes it sound like, hey, take a break. And I don't think that that was the intent of how it's written. And I know that wasn't the intent of how I understood the policy to be.  That's my perspective.",

During the public comment, it was mentioned that there had been a meeting with central office staff and with AEA officials and during that discussion,  Besides having this as a blanket policy, were any other things mentioned that the AEA expects the policy to be able to show to us and be able to state in concrete terms that would sort of clarify everything and sort of move the decision from a teacher? In other words, what points were made during that discussion?",

I felt quite enlightened because I gained the understanding and I think the cabinet gained the understanding that that was what they were looking for was more specific direction and less discretion because there was a concern that just as Dave was saying,  that one teacher may take the, I guess the lack of really clear direction to be more loose about the policy. And then another teacher would be more tight and it would cause issues for students. They become confused about what's appropriate and what's not.  And so it would make a less safe environment for students and staff. So where we left it was that we would make the policy more directive for teachers with less flexibility and more of a top-down edict on how things were to be done. So we've  We were waiting until we could talk with the board about it tonight and get input as we're getting now and then go back and make changes to the policy to make it that way. Does that pretty much capture that, Mr. Holden?",

We were, in addition to having some tighter guidelines, we were also going to develop some illustrative scenarios.  there would be a better understanding by teachers, the administration, everybody, parents, students about what would be expected. But certainly the language of the policy was never intended to provide carte blanche to just not have the masks on. It was really for very, very limited circumstances. And because it was a policy of general application,  We did account for certain potential exceptions, but indeed they would they were to be only exceptions But we hope to flesh that out a little bit more in accordance with our discussions with the AEA And go from there Okay When",
