As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused all of us to make adjustments. The court is in the same position. We've needed to make adjustments to ensure access to justice. And so what we've had to do is to modify how we conduct oral arguments. We are now proceeding with oral arguments via remote video conference. They will be live streamed for public access.  Our court staff has made every effort to prepare us and to prepare counsel for proceeding in this way. But inevitably, there will be glitches, I think. And so we will need to exercise patience with this new technology. The public will be able to view the arguments in real time at the DC Court of Appeals YouTube channel, which is on the court's website.  Council if you're ready you look like you are, I will call our first case, and it is number 18 t x 1321 accent your sub Inc versus District of Columbia. I believe, is it, Ms. Is it gland.",

We specifically appeal today the ruling of the two February 8th, 2019  ruling and the Superior Court judgment in favor of the Columbia in this matter, specifically the denial of the refund applied for by Accenture to the Office of Tax and Revenue, the court.  There's a question about timing that has been brought up by the District of Columbia. So I think I will address that first, because obviously, if the court does not have jurisdiction, this case goes nowhere. So the district basically said that the appeal that was filed by Accenture was not timely filed, and said that they proposed that the January 23, 2018 judgment was the final judgment.  Obviously, Accenture disagrees with that and says that the February 8, 2019 entry on the docket of the judgment was the final entry of the judgment on this matter. We need to look at the facts on this. For now, if you look at the transcript that the judge, the trial court judge did,  on 1-23-18, he specifically said that I will issue this for now, footnoted it and indicated there were going to be other information or other pronouncements coming from the court.",

One of the issues is, did the appellate actually have reason to believe  And DC lawyers, three attorneys, have never said anything. There was no objection. There wasn't, sorry, we can't do this, nothing. They were in total conformity with what the appellant believed.

We all of the appeal points are obviously in the brief, we don't have enough time to go through all of them as it as it's appropriate. But the main points on this is that the trial court aired by failing to apply the law to the two facts that the basis of the underlying assessment was wrong.  The underlying assessment was for nexus that created tax nexus for the appellant was based on two facts. One fact was somehow or another, that the sub had two employees in the District of Columbia and that somehow there was control proof of common control.  At no time did the District of Columbia bring evidence that showed proof of common control that there was any kind of some common management, nothing that's not in there. If you look at the conferees transcript.  They she specifically who was the contrary that this thing moved on before the trial was done but after the assessment said, I'm basing my position which is coming out of the conference on the fact they have two employees and common control.  In discovery we find that the joint stipulations and other declarations by DC employees from OTR, they specifically say we were wrong. Some did not have two employees in the District of Columbia, and they never showed common control they showed no indicia of it.  They didn't bring up anything that the person had common management. They didn't say that they had common bank accounts, common board of directors, none of that. And that is clearly in Supreme Court jurisprudence that to show this unity or the unitary principle, you have to show common management. You have to show common control and the district.

So we have created this UB unincorporated business tax, and you are going to be in there. Right. And if you're an unincorporated business a pass through business anything that qualifies as under Chapter K.  You are going to be in that unincorporated business regime. And here's part of the confusion is that the district is trying to have its cake and eat it to it wants the, the unincorporated businesses to be subject to the UB talks, but then it says yes.  If you can't be an unincorporated business, and here's the other point in this whole matter, your honors, there's a thing called a QHTC, Qualified High Tech Company in the District of Columbia. Specifically, the law says you can't be an unincorporated business and be a Qualified High Tech Company. But the district forces partnerships on pass-through entities to file, during this period in time, to file a UB return.  and pay the tax, the minimum tax. But then it says all your other income under the QHTC is now gone. It's forgiven. So if the district is saying that no, you can't be a UB because you can't file a UB because you're an unincorporated business and you can't, qualified high tech companies, excuse me, can't be an unincorporated business and file a UB return.  you've got to file a partnership return, then all of the benefits that go with that QHTC must flow. So the district can't have it both ways. It can't follow the federal procedure and say, yes, you're a partnership,  And you can't file a UB return. You can't pay any of the UB tax. So you're going to have to flow this through to your partners. We're going to grab your partners and bring them in. But you don't get any of the benefits as a qualified high-tech company.

Here's what happened. And it's in the brief. Accenture thought that there was one protocol or one process that needed to be filed. The District of Columbia came in and audited the whole group of Accenture companies, and including, at that time, Sub, who was filing the D-20 within the district. The district comes back and says,  You can't do that. LLP is supposed to be because LLP is my income was flowing through Accenture sub was filing a return recognizing that income district return district of Columbia audit comes in and says, you can't do that.  D, LLP is supposed to file an unincorporated, a UB return, and sub, you're not supposed to be filing a return at all. So we did exactly what they told us to do. And because with Paths to Entities, you pay tax on the income once, right? What happened is we're now filing a UB return and we have to pay tax on the UB level,  then the d20 that sub was filing is it wasn't supposed to be filed so we went back and filed amended returns for llp as a ub as instructed by the district and then the money all now all of a sudden the income of lp was now being taxed under the ub protocol  and you can't tax the same income twice, sub then goes and files for a refund on the monies that they have been paying by recognizing LP's income. The district goes ahead, recognizes that's what's supposed to happen, gives them the refund for the first three years, and then says, holy cromoly, we're losing money. We were making all this money with sub filing. Now we're not making that because at the same time,  The QHTC came in.  And Accenture realized, LLP realized it could qualify as a qualified high-tech company. And one of the benefits of that is that you don't pay income tax or after a period of years, you pay a reduced rate. So they did that. They qualify, the district let them qualify. So now what's happening is effectively, UP is not having to pay tax on its income because of the district's position on qualified high-tech credits.  Accenture gets its money back from where it had been filing erroneously. DC is the one who tells them this is what they're supposed to be doing. Now when DC and it's documented in the conferees transcript, if we let them do that, we're not going to be getting taxes. We don't like that. I understand.",

The Scali ABBA versus cellular D or Sario which is the Supreme Court case that basically said the Chevron Skidmore defense does not apply when the statutory provisions are directly contradictory.  And in this case, you've got a statutory requirement in the district that you can qualify as a qualified high tech company. And then in another section it says, but you can't be a qualified high tech company can't be an unincorporated business.  So, and you've got the district then saying yes but you need to file an unincorporated and only unincorporated businesses can file an unincorporated business return. So, the fact that we're supposed to give deference to the districts.  reading of this would be well and fine in maybe a normal circumstance, but this isn't. Because clearly under Scaliaba, the Supreme Court, Chevron and Skidmore defense cannot be applied when the statutory provisions are directly contradictory. And that is exactly what happened in this matter. If the district wants  sub and LLP wants LLP to file as a partnership, which it really can't because of the numericals on how much income it earns. But if they want them to file a partnership return, then the qualifications and benefits of a qualified high-tech company, which all parties agree that LLP is, flows down through. So that's our worst case scenario, is that if LLP has to file as a partnership, then  sub, even though it's a second tier partner, not a direct partner. And imagine if you all of a sudden say you can go to second and third tier partners on stuff, what the chaos that is going to cause. And it's not in the statute anyway. But if you say that LLP is a partnership and has to file that partnership return, in spite of what the law says that they're not supposed to be filing that partnership return, then all the high tech benefits have to flow through to the partners.

And I'd also like to note that to the extent that appellant tries now to resort to some sort of unusual circumstances or equitable tolling doctrine, she did not raise that in her reply brief. And so it's therefore not properly before this court. I also don't think that equitable tolling would be available in any event under the recent Supreme Court decision in the Justice of the Court, and also under the facts of this case. So I think plainly, the January 2018 judgment was final, and Accenture subs' failure to take an appeal within 30 days  rendered this appeal untimely as a mandatory claims processing rule. Rule four must be applied to dismiss the appeal.",

    "text": " Well, outside the record, I can say, as a matter of fact, that was not the case. But there are certain exceptions to Rule 4 that allow a judgment to be reopened for a period of 180 days. And so I think until all of those potential exceptions to any Rule 4 would have expired, we were still in a position to, you know, negotiate with the appellant. And we, when the appellant wanted to go and ask counsel whether any opinion was forthcoming, the district had to be a party to those communications, because otherwise they would have been ex parte. However, when Accenture sub moved for  on this motion for entry of judgment, we vociferously opposed that, said that we believe that the January 23rd, 2018 judgment was the final judgment, and that the court could not reopen that judgment or otherwise issue a new order from which a new appeal time could run. And so we've taken this position consistently both below and on appeal. And so I think- Given what the court said from the bench, was there any theory under which the amount owing would be anything other than zero?  Not at all. I'd like to actually address that, Mr. Thompson, in the context of the Rule 14 argument. If you look at a federal equivalent, which is Tax Rule 155, it is quite clear from federal case law that Tax Rule 155 is discretionary. And so where no computation is needed, it's unnecessary. And for that, I'd point this court to the Testor case in the Seventh Circuit and also to the Prevail case from the Tax Court.  Both would speak to the fact that Rule 14 is not some typical way by which judgments in tax court are rendered, but rather a discretionary sort of ability of the court, if they think that there's a computation that needs to happen, to put that math problem onto the parties and then to ask them to come back with a calculation. But here the question was always whether some owed all of the taxes that it had originally paid or nothing. And so there was no need for any computations. And so I think the only way that this court could reach the merits of the appeal  is if they were to find some type of equitable tolling. Now, of course, appellant's failure to raise that in response to the timeliness objection in her reply brief forecloses it, because it's the burden of the party seeking tolling to make the record. I would like to, though, note, even if this had been preserved, equitable tolling would not be warranted. We're not talking about a situation where the trial court affirmatively misled anybody. The trial court was quite clear at various hearings. I would point this court to Supplemental Transcript 4, which was an April hearing on a motion for summary judgment.  At that point, the court said, look, I'm trying to issue a written decision. If I don't, by the next hearing, I'll issue an oral decision in open court. That's what he did at the hearing on January 22. And then when the district counsel followed up to say, well, procedurally, Your Honor, what happens next? He expressly said, what I do is I will issue an order. And then I will try to follow up with, I think what he called it, is a memorandum. And again, under NIH and federal case law, it is well established that appeal deadlines do not run from memoranda. They don't run from opinions.  They run from judgments, and that's what we have on January 23rd. I think that's also confirmed if you look at the docket. Since under the tax rules don't incorporate all of the federal rules, all that needs to happen is for there to be an entry on the docket, not even a separate order. And if you look at the docket, and this is supplemental record, sorry, supplemental appendix page eight, you'll see it says disposition, summary judgment, date, January 23rd. And even if there needed to be a separate order, we have that order in the January 23rd order  there is absolutely no way for the court to reach the merits of this case under NRA NIH and under nutraceutical and the Supreme Court precedent on equitable tolling in the claims processing context.",

    "text": "Absolutely. So first, a couple of responses to questions that were raised to my opposing counsel. Judge McLeese, on pages six  In seven of their opening brief, sub admits that as a disregard, sorry, as a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes, LLC is also a disregarded entity for district tax purposes. And therefore, they are just out of the equation. And so this notion of being a second tier partner, they are considered and treated as a direct partner for purposes of this analysis. Next, Thompson, as to what changed, I think it's worth unpacking this here, because while appellants counsel sort of gave some of the story, it's not all of the story.  Initially, LLP was exempt from the unincorporated business statute because it was rendering personal services as a significant portion of its business. And so what happened was the LLP would file its partnership return, and then its individual partners would pay district income tax to the extent they were district residents. LLP decided to restructure, or sorry, Accenture kind of globally decided to restructure, the consequence of which is rather than having individual partners, they then had corporate partners.  That meant that they no longer qualified as an unincorporated business under the statute. And so that meant that they were subject to the unincorporated business tax. At that point in 2005, OTR audited Accenture LLP and subbed and said, what's going on here? So LLP at that point discovered this QHTC statute. Now the QHTC statute, like the personal services exemption, is something that takes you outside of the unincorporated business realm.  So by virtue of being retroactively certified for QHTC status, that put LLP back in the position where they should have been filing a partnership return. And then their partners here, Inc and Sub, would be responsible for franchise taxes on their share of the distributed income. And so it isn't that anything changed. It's that there was an evolution of how LLP was structured, and that restructure had consequences. And then because they tried to retroactively claim and were given,  QHTC status, it essentially put them back in a situation where the forms they had originally filed were now correct, just for a different set of reasons. I follow all of that, but it does remain a bit of a mystery why, if that's the correct analysis, a refund was given to Accenture for three of the tax years it issued. To be sure, they were not entitled to that. OTR made a mistake.  The center is not allowed to capitalize on that mistake and suddenly a stop OTR from applying the actual statute as written in the years going forward. And that's probably true.",

If the issue is OTR, you know, these are tax statutes that OTR administers, and if it gives a reasoned explanation for its interpretation of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, then this court owes some deference. If there's an unexplained inconsistency in what OTR has done, it has given a refund for some years and not for other years, and nobody's explained why, does that affect  whether we should be deferring to OTR because we don't know why, what it's thinking is because it doesn't seem to be applying a coherent theory, or does that mean instead we need to set it back or we should be deciding without deference to OTR?",

    "text": "So a few responses, Your Honor. First, deference is not needed here because the plain language of the statute is clear. The QHTC regime gives a corporate franchise rate benefit to incorporated QHTCs. For unincorporated QHTCs, it merely takes them out of the realm of being an unincorporated business  and puts them into this partnership status akin to when the center was trying to claim the personal services exemptions. And so I think deference doesn't need to enter the equation. Next, to the extent you want to give deference, it would be to the current interpretation of OTR, which has been consistent since 2014. And that is because that interpretation is the only interpretation that accords with the statute.  It's well established that this court does not give deference to interpretations that are inconsistent with the statute. And it is quite clear that OTR's prior interpretation of the statute did not actually hew to the statute's text because it was failing to understand the critical difference between incorporated and unincorporated businesses as it applied to their QHTC status. I guess that's if we can. I'm sorry.",

    "text": "Emma Peterson Absolutely. So I think there are probably three factual pieces under this. First, OTR clearly admitted before the trial court that it made a mistake.  And so while the trial judge said, oh, for reasons unclear to me, they gave these refunds for tax years 01 to 03, I don't think that's significant. And so I also think, going back to my first response to Judge McLeese, we don't even need to touch deference here. All you need to do is look at the plain language of the statute. It's only if the statute is ambiguous that we start looking to deference. And so I think next on that point, the deference, I think, would have to be owing only to the interpretation of OTR that squares with the statute. And that is the determination of OTR from 2014 onward  that the QHTC status works differently for incorporated businesses than unincorporated businesses. Can I ask you, leave aside for a minute plain language, what is your explanation about why the council logically would have wanted to have quite disparate treatment for the QHTC tax treatment of unincorporated businesses and incorporated QHTCs?  So just to put my marker down, I believe the plain language is clear. So we don't need to resort to legislative history, but to the extent we do, the legislative history answers the question of the council's intent, your honor. So it's very clear under the legislative history that in order to get corporations to come here, they needed to get some sort of franchise tax rate benefit. And so what the council determined to do was to give a 6% benefit and then to give a five year hiatus to companies that located in particular redevelopment zones.  Now that five-year tax holiday was ultimately extended to all corporate QHTCs. But for unincorporated businesses, the concern that was raised, and this comes, I think, from both the Akin Gump testimony and the Tim Hart testimony, and so this is S.A. 71 and 76, I think the concern was that out-of-state individual investors, if QHTCs were, unincorporated QHTCs were under the UB regime,  those would be subject to entity level tax by the district. And then the individual investors might not be able to get a tax credit for that because most states don't treat partnerships or unincorporated businesses as taxable entities in their own right. And so there was this concern that an individual investor would be subject to double tax, where the unincorporated QHTC would be subject to the unincorporated business franchise tax in DC.  And then the individual outside investor would be subject to tax on that income, even though it had already been taxed at the district level. So the legislative history is not trying to put the unincorporated businesses and the incorporated businesses on equal footing. In fact, the legislative history is also quite clear on that point, that for incorporated businesses, the franchise tax rate in Virginia was 6%. And so it was very important for incorporated businesses to have parity with Virginia to draw them into the district  or at least not disincentivize them to locate to the district or to leave the district. And Virginia and other jurisdictions don't tax unincorporated businesses. And so necessarily, how the QHTC statute treats unincorporated businesses is going to be quite different, and it's going to be animated by different tax concerns. I think I follow much of that, I hope, or at least some of it.",

    "text": "So respecting that marker and with the caveat that no statute  goes at all costs, I would say just a few things. First, the council was worried about accepting QHTC, unincorporated QHTCs from the UB statute. It was thinking about individual investors. They were not thinking about partnerships or unincorporated businesses that would have corporate partners. So in some ways, the fact that a sub is liable for the corporate franchise tax right here is because a corporation has elected to partner with a QHTC in this manner.  And so LLP could obviously change its structure, could become incorporated, and then would be able to take advantage of the full amount of the corporate franchise tax rate benefits that are afforded to incorporated QHDCs under the statute. Throughout the trial record, it's quite clear that Accenture made a deliberate determination to remain as an LLP when it restructured, and it did so without consideration of how state tax implications affected that. It is clear that if it wants to get the benefit of the statute, it has a way to do so. It also has the ability to go back to the council  This statute has been revised twice now. And at no point, to my knowledge, has the center gone back and said, look, you wanted to encourage business in the district, including for unincorporated QHTCs, but the way that you've done it here is actually hurting us. They could have done that when the QHTC legislation was being amended. They could have also just gone to the council and asked for their own tax abatement, which we see corporations doing and unincorporated businesses doing all of the time. And so I don't think that  the mere fact that the consequence of a censure and a censure substructure puts them outside of the ability to take advantage of the corporate franchise tax benefit for incorporated QHTCs require some sort of gymnastics to rewrite or reread the statute in a way that doesn't accord with its plain language and also is inconsistent to the concerns presented in the legislative history.",

    "text": "So first, it was not preserved below. In fact, at motion for summary judgment, I think it's 32 footnote 48.  The party said they were not at this point raising the question of whether QHTC status should flow up from LLP to sub. They asked for an opportunity to have further briefing on that if the court were to disagree with them on their motion for summary judgment. And the district opposed that and said, no, you had your shot at the summary judgment apple. You don't get to have a second round. So that issue is not before the court because it was not before the court below. But I would also note that on the merits, there is a difference between how factors for  apportionment flow up and how statuses flow up. The characteristics of the income at issue would flow up in a pass-through entity. But this is not a characteristic of the LLP's income. It's a characteristic of the LLP itself. So the LLP, by virtue of being a QHTC, gets several benefits. It might not get a franchise tax rate benefit, but it can get  property tax abatements, it can get personal property exemptions, and for some years can get exclusions to sales tax. So those are very important benefits that flow to the LLP that the LLP is allowed to take advantage of. And so that entity characterization cannot flow up because it's separate from the income. And independently, sub itself does not qualify as a QHTC. If we were in a position where sub was itself a QHTC, it might be able to get a benefit on its corporate franchise taxes.  However, it doesn't meet the criteria because it doesn't have employees in the district. It doesn't have office space in the district. And so since it is not independently a QHTC, it is not entitled to this benefit. And LLP is the one who can take the benefit. It may be that it can't get a benefit on its corporate franchise taxes, but that's how the council structured the regime.",

Two points that I want to bring up is, one, in this court, having to do with the mandatory nature of the  decision is that for purposes of timing, I think you need to look at the frame. This court in frame clearly said that when the appellant has been affirmatively misled into delaying the filing of a motion of appeal by some action or conduct of the trial court, the appeal will be allowed if the notice of appeal is timely filed after the misleading action has been corrected.  Clearly, we have in the timeline and in the facts that once the District of Columbia, Attorney Wood, and the then attorneys called the clerk and said, we're waiting, we're out here, we're waiting, what are we going to get? A clerk called back and by email said, I've talked to the judge, he's decided, no, no, that was it. Within 30 days of that time period,  The appellate then filed the appeal. So they did exactly what the court had instructed in frame that as timely filed after the misleading action had been corrected. So the appellate did do that, without a doubt.  I then have to one other argument that the court made about I mean that the DC has made about the partnership returns. You're right. The entity that is in the District of Columbia the LP does get property tax benefits remember, and we've always said it has an office it has employees, it has a physical presence in the District of Columbia.  It has an LLP. But if you look at the federal law, which the DC law is in conformity with, partnerships can do that. They are separate legal entities. If there are benefits that they get them, that's fine. That is all calculated into the income that is then flowed down and pushed down. So if they get a credit for training,  they get a credit for property tax, they get a credit against their business license tax, or they have to pay the baseball tax in the District of Columbia. All that is calculated and then the income and or losses is pushed down to the partnerships. It is well-established federal law and state law that a partnership  Everything gets passed down to its partners, all characteristics get passed down. It's not the characteristic of the entity itself, whether or not it gets to have free parking spaces or anything like that. The characteristics that are noted in the Internal Revenue Code  Our credits losses, and definitely, and any benefits that that is done the calculation that net gets pushed down to the partnerships, and they get to take the credits to the same extent that the entity did they get the losses to the same extent that the entity did.  So, all we're saying your honors is, if you, if you are going to believe that it's a partnership, and it needs to pass it down, then we get those same benefits that the partnership gets as a qualified high tech credit company or certified company, which includes a reduction in the franchise tax rate.  So, it that is just established federal law. The other thing is that the DC says that we didn't argue this in the court below. We've, it was in the initial petition is in the brief that that was filed and argued in the Superior Court.  You're right that we said, if your honor is going to go down this road, we want a chance to brief it further. We absolutely did. But it is in the petition, in both the original petition and the amended petition, and was argued at the trial court. All right. Thank you. Thank you to both counsel for your arguments.",

    "text": "Good morning, Your Honor. I may please the court, Caroline Van Zyl, on behalf of the Office of Risk Management. I would like to reserve two minutes for rebuttal. This public sector workers' compensation appeal presents the question whether a schedule award is available for impairment to the brain or psychological injury.  Under the text of the relevant statute, it is not. At the outset, it is important to understand what a schedule award is and what it is not. Schedule awards are not typical wage loss awards. No one here disputes that awards are generally available for injuries to the brain when wages are lost. And schedule awards are not for temporary conditions. Rather, schedule awards are designed to provide injured employees with a some certain for the permanent loss or loss of use  of a particular part or function of the body. Toward that end, the council, borrowing from an existing federal statute, adopted a specific and extensive list of body parts subject to a schedule award and the amount of payment warranted. So 312 weeks' compensation for the loss of an arm, 38 weeks' compensation for the loss of a great toe, and so on. This list also accounts for the loss of use of organs, but notably,  the council specifically excluded the brain from the definition of a compensable organ. The message is clear. A discrete award for impairment of the brain over and above actual wage loss benefits is not permitted. Not only is the statute clear on this score, but ORM, the expert agency overseeing public sector workers' compensation, has issued an opinion here  and regulations clarifying that impairments not listed on the schedule are not available for schedule awards. That determination merits deference.",

So the award is available once a pre-existing injury that has been deemed compensable has gotten as good as it's going to get with medical treatment. And so procedurally, what the claimant does and what the claimant did here is files a specific form along with medical documentation requesting a schedule award for a specific body part here, the head slash brain. And so  Procedurally, I would describe it as an outgrowth of the original award or notice of determination as opposed to a completely different proceeding or reopened case. What statute or regulation, I guess, would you consider such the later application to have been filed pursuant to, not substantively, but procedurally? Procedurally, so  I mean, obviously substantively the most relevant statute is six 23.07. Um, there are regulations that, that do cover this, that, uh, were promulgated in, in 2017. Um, basically what the regulations say is that because the statute is, is silent as to whether this is the sort of determination on what you get a hearing, um, ORM has interpreted the statute to, to funnel  those sorts of claims through the program, the CRO, and then up through the Superior Court into here is sort of part of the progression.

There was then testimony at one of, I believe, the Senate hearings where a doctor explained that injuries to the back are both difficult to diagnose and difficult to classify.

So just to close the loop on the legislative history and then to turn to your question, what happened after that hearing was this definition was inserted that exempted the back, heart, and brain from the definition of organ. So I think it's fair to assume that a similar rationale applied to all of them. What I would say about a severe spine injury like that, and you could say something similar about brain impairments,  the disability radiates, right? So if you have a severed spine, you would expect to see the loss of use of perhaps both legs, which are compensable as consecutive awards. So similarly, the schedule, for example, doesn't include the loss of use of the shoulder.  But we often see awards in cases where the shoulder was injured. It's just that the shoulder injury impairs the arm. It radiates. And so that's what you see the award for. I assume is it also true that in a scenario like that, there might also be the possibility of getting a wage loss award if it had a wage loss impact? Absolutely. Absolutely. And that is the default in workers' compensation. The default is that you measure compensation by wages lost.  You know, here, for example, Miss Jordan was temporarily out of the office for about six months and she received wage loss compensation, temporary wage loss compensation for that time. Schedule awards are a quasi exception to that rule. They are still meant to capture predicted wage loss where the injury is severe enough that wage loss can be presumed.  But you don't have to show wage loss. And for that reason, sometimes they can both overcompensate or undercompensate for what you might expect to receive based purely on wage loss, but it is when the claims examiner first denied this claim the rationale was that the",

So it's not before the court.  put all our eggs, so to speak, in the statutory basket for purposes of this appeal. We do not concede, however, that there was anything incorrect about that argument. We just think that it is incredibly clear that the statute bars compensation under the schedule for a psychological impairment, and therefore you don't need backup or alternative rationales. One other  textual wrinkle that I would note is if the court were to, as Ms. Jordan requests, open up the schedule to awards for body parts that are not specifically named or not considered compensable organs, the court would also have to determine how to measure wage loss because there's simply no relevant text. And so the question would be, do you  value these losses based on actual wage loss, based on some proper and equitable consideration in proportion to the total body. There are so many different options for compensating these awards that it is a quintessentially legislative judgment in terms of whether and how to do so. So that is another reason why we would urge the court not to open up the schedule and embrace a sort of atextual  non-schedule award for permanent partial disabilities.",

    "text": "Good morning. Good morning.  May it please the court, my name is Charles Tucker Jr., and I'm counsel for the appellee, Ms. Sheila Jordan. Sheila Jordan respectfully asked this court to affirm the Superior Court's decision reversing the agency's denial of her petition of permanent partial disability compensation for three main reasons. One, the agency's decision is arbitrary and not in accordance with the facts.  The agency's decision is not in accordance with the law. Three, affirming the agency's decision would effectively serve as a blanket endorsement of unequal protection under the law. Your Honors, we're here today arguing about whether or not public sector employees are entitled to equal protection under the law that governs workers' compensation in the District of Columbia.  The permanent partial disability compensation that has been denied under the CPA is afforded to D.C. 's private sector employees under the Workers' Compensation Act and to D.C. 's federal employees under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. Although it has been long established that mental and emotional injuries are compensable under workers' compensation law, the agency has interpreted the statute  to require the PTSD be considered a brain injury for which compensation is barred. This interpretation, upon which the agency bases its decision, is arbitrary and unreasonable, as the court did find. For this reason, the court owes the decision no deference and must, in the interest of justice, review the statutory interpretation no more. Brings me to my first point, Your Honors.  which is that the agency's decision is arbitrary because the factual findings upon which the decision is established are not supported by substantial evidence. This court has recognized what substantial evidence is, and it's more than a scintilla of evidence. Here, the record supports two main facts. One, Ms. Jordan filed a Form 12 making a claim for permanent partial disability compensation.  or specifically PTSD, not for injury to her brain. Secondly, that the agency approved compensation for Ms. Jordan's PTSD. Getting more precisely to my first point, section three, subsection B of form 12 lists Ms. Jordan's diagnosis  or nature of disease or injury as post-traumatic stress disorder. Section 3, subsection D of form 12, specifically describes findings and relevant diagnostic test results as avoidance of fear and anxiety. Subsection 3, E,  of the Form 12 lists the health care provider's specialty as a psychiatrist. Now, Your Honors, I'm not a medical doctor here trying to break things down for you this morning, nor do I claim to be. But clearly, those facts illustrate that Ms. Jordan was being treated for a PTSD claim, a injury, or a issue dealing with  physical, emotional impairment. The entirety of the record submitted in support of the PPP claim specifies the condition and injury as specifically PTSD. It is unreasonable, then, for the agency to make a factual finding that Ms. Jordan sought PPP for a brain injury. Well, counsel, let's say that that's correct.",

They paid for the treatment, the medical treatment.  for the diagnoses, and in fact, paid for supplement requests for treatment.

And the treatment by their own doctors supported in the record that at all relevant times, she was being treated for a PTSD condition.

I don't know how it's calculated, Your Honor, and I will not attempt to make such an assumption at this time. However, the agency determines such.

And this question somewhat more broadly, which is, can you get a scheduled award for something that's not listed and doesn't fall within the catch all?  uh uh provision uh your opponent argues that the authorities actually go the other way and they say if you're not on the schedule and can't fit within the catch-all as you know back and uh uh brain claims can't uh then you cannot get a scheduled award um but you're saying that your understanding is that that's not the case that there's authority for giving such awards i'd point to court to",

    "text": "Thank you, Your Honor. A few points, starting with the last point that my friend was addressing.  The ECAB is the final adjudicatory agency that determines workers' compensation awards under the FECA. And we have cited a number of ECAB decisions that stand for the proposition. One, not only is the brain not compensable, and not only are psychological injuries not compensable under the FECA, after which the CMPA was modeled, but there is no such thing as a  an extra schedule award. Schedule awards are limited to the byparts delineated in the text of the statute. And in our brief, we quote In re Lawrence Fulton, which was a 2002 ECAB case. And we have reviewed the cases that have addressed this issue since, and that remains good law in the ECAB. If the DDC has decided something else  First of all, it would be very surprising to me if it were dealing with a schedule award. And second of all, I'm not sure what the authority would be to adjudicate workers' compensation schedule awards since federal law is very clear that the ECAB has the final say and is unreviewable even through mandamus on these issues. Second, in terms of whether PTSD is properly viewed as a brain impairment,  The form 12 that was submitted by Ms. Jordan, which is in the appendix, terms this as a brain slash head injury. So that was her representation that is in accord with the AMA guides, which are the touchstone for these determinations under the relevant regulations. And so to now say that PTSD is something other than a brain or head impairment, I think it's foreclosed both by  the form 12 and by the briefing that has since occurred in this case. And in terms of this idea that somehow Ms. Jordan is being treated unequally because she has a psychological impairment, either because the Workers' Compensation Act might compensate something like this or because in circumstances where wage loss occurred, she would be entitled to compensation.  That just is not true either as a matter of fact or as a matter of law under the WCA. If you want to get a non-schedule award, you have to show wage loss. And here, the issue for Ms. Jordan is that she has not shown wage loss other than the first six months when she was out of work. There's been no continuing wage loss. And I would note that to the extent that there are differences between the public sector and private sector statutes,  Those are presumably intentional, and they adhere in the text of the statute. If Ms. Jordan wanted to challenge that as being contrary to equal protection or something like that, she would have had the opportunity to do so in her briefing here and below. She did not. And for those reasons, if the court has no further questions, we would ask that the judgment of the Superior Court be reversed. Thank you.",

And so the UCC, in addition to the CPPA, would permit Ms. Archie to assert these claims. Now, had U.S. Bank never acquired this loan, could she have sued U.S. Bank under the CPPA? No, but that doesn't address the question of whether once U.S. Bank brings an action against her standing in the shoes of Premier, can she then assert as a recoupment claim  A claim having to do with the wrongful and origination of the loan that penny Mac now us bank is seeking to enforce, and I would also note that penny Mac and now us bank never contended that Miss Archie couldn't assert for example unconscionability.  defense is a common law as a defense and as a recoupment defense or fraud, for example. And so I think it would be entirely inconsistent with the statutory objectives that the DC Council had to hold that only when the CPPA is at issue, you cannot assert even as a recoupment claim or recoupment defense  a CPPA claim.

    "text": " So I think the major issues are as follows a reasonable jury could have found that premier violated the CPA certainly by lying about miss Archie's income to qualify her for the loan.  And I'd like to direct the court to a couple pieces of the record that make that, in my view, crystal clear. At page 799 of the joint appendix, you'll see the last loan application, which is dated as of the date of closing, which in itself is highly unusual. And you'll see that it reports Ms. Archie's income is $12,187.  And if you look at page 871 of the Joint Appendix, you see the underwriting requirements that Citi gave to Premier because the way that this transaction operated was Citi was going to buy this loan immediately after it was originated.  And you see that Citi told Premier that Ms. Archie needed $12,187 of monthly income to qualify for this loan. And I think what that shows is that Premier obviously knew exactly the income that Ms. Archie needed to qualify for this loan. And that's exactly what they put in that last loan application.  And that, in my mind, would have been certainly more than sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Premier had knowledge that there was no reasonable probability payment in full by Ms. Archie, that Premier, in fact, misrepresented Ms. Archie's income. And I'd also point the court to the testimony of the only other person who is involved in all of this who testified, who was Rob Jackson. He participated before the closing.  And I would really recommend looking at his testimony carefully because you see, he, when I asked him about these loan applications he interrupted me and this is a page 683 of the joint appendix, and he said that he couldn't remember his own signature.  And that he has changed his signature since then and it looks different. He also though admitted that the loan file contained crazy stuff that should never happen. And in particular, he was referring to the changing  income on the loan applications. The other documentation in the record, the fake pay stubs and the W-2 didn't add up even to the income that Premier was representing. So a reasonable jury could easily have concluded that Premier violated the CPPA. And as the D.C. Circuit said in Williams, that would have been highly persuasive as to a finding of common law unconscionability.  As well, I asked you again I'm sorry to circle back around to this in a way but when you are asked you when your answer says a reasonable jury could have found that premier violated the CPA.",

And as an assign of a merchant, I think U.S. Bank would be properly subjected to a counterclaim based on that language.  But again, you don't have to reach that issue to permit Miss Archie to assert a recoupment defense that she would have had against premier, given that US Bank is not a holder in due course that under the UCC, all the claims that she would have had available in recoupment against premier are available to her.

I don't think that affects the CPPA question because it's this court recognized in modern management versus Wilson and as Judge Bates recognized in Hughes v. Abel, what you might call victim complicity doesn't mean that the person doesn't have a CPPA claim.  There was, of course, a strong dispute that Ms. Archie had knowledge that Premier was misrepresenting her income. And that was an issue that the jury would have had to resolve. The court ruled on summary judgment that she couldn't establish any of these defenses because she'd had prior transactions. But again, if that was the case, you wouldn't have had a plaintiff prevail in modern management.  In DeBerry, where this court ruled that the CPBA did apply to transactions just like this one, the plaintiff had been involved in four refinancings and the court never suggested that the latter three would be, of course, exonerated for the lender. And the court didn't hear from Ms. Archie at all. So it didn't consider all of the circumstances, which you would certainly have to do before ruling on common law.  unconscionability. It didn't address that, you know, perhaps the fact that she was involved in these prior transactions shows that she was easily susceptible to being duped by a scam like this. That, excuse me, that she suffered from disabling mental and physical conditions.

    "text": "So let me just pick up right where we're talking about unconscionability, substantive and procedural in the nature of this transaction.  One of the things in the case law that we talk about with unconscionability is the effect of the loan. And that really goes to why this loan happened. Again, this was the third loan Ms. Archie took out in three years against this property where she had had no mortgage on the property at all, no deed of trust. When she took a title to it, she'd already taken a lot of money out of the property. And if you look at her own affidavit,  But on page 639 of the appendix where she says, well, I had to work with these people on the foreclosure rescue program because you couldn't afford the loan that she was in.  And so the effect of this alone, whether she could pay it back or not under its own terms based on the income she wound up having over the last 12 years, is that she wound up staying in the property for 12 years and paying only a small piece of the cash that she received from the loan back as payments for a few months.  I thought there was a factual dispute about the extent to which, or there's a claim that there was a factual dispute about the extent to which she actually received the proceeds of the loans. I think that, yeah, it's unclear what she was saying exactly about that issue, but it is clear that she only made a few payments. I think it was about eight payments.  And according to her, she didn't have income. So I think it's a pretty fair inference that the money came from the cash that she received from the transaction. But in any case, it was less than the cash that was put out by the lender that ever came back on this loan. So she's paid nothing from her social security, from anything else on this loan ever.  And this was, when you talk about equity here and what the equitable result is, and this was something that Judge Jackson said below, she's paid nothing on this for a decade and more. And at a time when she says she has little to no income. I mean, I think her perspective is that it really isn't that unfair that she paid nothing on it.",

Remember, the vast majority of the money from this loan went to pay off a prior loan, over $300,000 that she was in debt at that point. And the reason I started by mentioning that section of her affidavit talking about foreclosure rescue programs she wanted to participate in, the reason she got this loan is because she was going to run out of money on that loan and lose the property 13 years ago. So that's why we are where we are now in terms of the equity  In terms of unconscionability and the substance of the loan, the substance of terms of loan are clearly proper and reasonable and were at the time per person of her credit worthiness. And the form of the loan standard federal Fannie Mae Freddie Mac form loan documents. So there's no problem there. And the interest rate is well within what the law allowed. It was an adjustable rate. And over the last 10 years, it's gone way down actually, lower than even what she would have wanted.  She never reached the point of actually paying on the lower terms. So I don't see any substantive unconscionability here in terms of the loan. And then when we talk about Mr. Knott has made a lot of what the process was in terms of the loan being originated and her income. And he always characterizes this as what Premier says. But at the end of the day, she signed the loan application. It's her obligation under law to review that and make sure it's proper and to not sign it if it's false.  But her position throughout this has been that she didn't read anything. She didn't ask any questions to anybody, essentially ever, about the terms and what she was doing. And she has a responsibility to do that, to at least ask about what's going on.  Do you disagree with Mr. Knott in his interpretation of the CPPA and the provision about successors and interest being subject to the same claims as Premier would be? Yes, we disagree with that. We don't think that PennyMac or U.S. Bank is a merchant as defined within the Act.  And the subsequent case law on that, including some of the cases we've cited in our brief, talk about having to continue to be involved in making credit available to a person. For example, the O'Sinubepe Allow case talks about that. And, you know, our clients were, my clients were completely passive here in terms of taking this assignment and don't bear the same, we're not merchants in relation to her, merchants in general.  with regard to this credit transaction. All the credit came from Premier 13 years ago. So we don't see them as merchants. And that was the whole thing below. Is that consistent, you think, with the Deberry interpretation?",

But nonetheless, she didn't do anything more than just basically put herself in the hands of other people and made no effort to even learn what she was doing. So, you know, she did nothing to,  try to learn what was happening here.

But of course, those were the issues that were disputed and that a jury would have had the opportunity to evaluate had it been able to hear testimony from Ms. Archie. It's not correct, by the way, that Ms. Archie received the default judgment against Premier. That didn't happen.  For purposes of U.S. Bank and PennyMac, I actually believe that they are merchants. They participate in the supply side of the transaction. I think they claim to have made some payments for taxes and insurance and things of that nature to preserve their claim to the property. So they're still involved with this transaction. And I would also point out that, again, unless U.S. Bank is a holder in due course, which it is not,  It takes the bitter and it takes the sweet. It has a claim to try to enforce this loan that a purchase but it is subject to the defenses that Miss Archie would have had. And again under the CPA section 3901 a five, as well as 3905 k one.  An action for relief from a trade practice such as this is certainly, I think, a defense to enforcement of an unconscionable mortgage, which this was. As far as the timing of when U.S. Bank purchased the loan, because it's attempting to claim some superior equitable position here, U.S. Bank bought this loan after judgment had been entered for Ms. Archie on the statute of limitations.  And only subsequent to that did the court reverse that decision. After initially saying in the 2017 hearing that there were a lot of factual issues, certainly as it related to unconscionability, the court then reversed course and found that the fact that Ms. Archie had been involved in prior transactions was dispositive. And that is inconsistent with modern management. It's inconsistent with Hughes v. Abel, Williams v. First Government, and other CPPA decisions.  Lastly, Mr. Smith took the position that the UCC...
