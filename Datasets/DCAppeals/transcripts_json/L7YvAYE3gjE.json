    "text": "This case is about how the trial court misapplied the law and abused its discretion in determining child support for two minor children. Not just a case of one appealable point, but many, as there were many flaws in the trial court's opinion, and one of which we believe requires reversal.  misapplied the law by ignoring the actual family history, awarded child support for certain expenses when those expenses did not primarily benefit the children, did not follow the plain language of the child support statute, shifted the burden to Mr. Klisch to rebut evidence of expenses for the children with documents when it did not require Mrs. Klisch to prove those expenses with documents.  disregarded the law by not doing a realistic assessment of Mrs. Clish's ability to pay child support. And it did not determine or rightly determined that Mrs. Clish's income for child support purposes was $342,000 per year.  The award was rooted in giving Mrs. Klisch child support so she was better able to meet her own expenses. Mrs. Klisch asked the trial court to consider her personal expenses of $201,000 per year as a basis for awarding child support. And the court did that. And the reason we know that the court did that is because the court acknowledged it in one of its rulings. The court said,  The Child Support Award, which includes an order that defendant pay retroactive child support, will put plaintiff on a more even footing with respect to the maintenance of the children going forward, which in turn will free her up to better bear her own costs. This is at page 33 of our brief, your honors. This is a case where Mrs. Klisch, who earns $342,000 a year that we assert, is paying less than 10% of the children's expenses.  and claims that she needs child support to buy Christmas gifts for her own children.",

For example, when it comes to this mortgage  the mortgage as it relates to everything other than the interest payment, because it's just like any other improvement to the house that benefits the title holder. When you pay a mortgage, there's a certain amount of the mortgage and it changes over time, but there's a certain amount of the mortgage that goes directly to reduction in principle. That directly benefits the title holder, that directly in theory increases the value of the equity in the home. And it's just like a capital improvement.  But it's more than a capital improvement. Because a capital improvement, if you improve your house and put on an addition, there's really no guarantee that the value of your house is going to increase dollar for dollar. You just don't know. It may, it may not, but usually not. But when you pay down dollar for dollar the principle of your mortgage, it is dollar for dollar increasing the equity in your home. And that is primarily benefiting the titleholder, Mrs. Clutch in this case.  may incidentally benefit the children because they live there, but it primarily benefits Mrs. Klisch, because long after the children have left, she's going to have that house. And all of the principal payments that were made based upon child support that were received inures solely to the benefit of Mrs. Klisch. None of that inures to the benefit of the children.  We believe that is a misapplication of the law, that she disregarded the law in that regard, related to the mortgage, related to the work-related childcare, related to transportation, that principle of the law.",

So after that one or two years of them practicing in the pool, and then they graduate from college, that pool is going to remain there. And when Mrs. Clish markets her home to sell it, she's going to go, look, I put in this pool. The value of my home is much more now. She shouldn't get child support to be able to put a pool in the ground so the children can swim there two summers.  This principle also applies to things like the car, Your Honor, the transportation. This is a case where Mr. Klisch was ordered to pay child support to maintain the car.  The car is a unique situation in this case because immediately before the only a few days before the trial was the car even transferred into Mrs. Clish's name. Her mom paid all the expenses of the car. But the trial court decided that, and it's right in the judgment of absolute the divorce, the trial court speculated, we say, because  Mrs. Clish may need the car in case the children are in emergency, or it's very difficult to navigate the streets of D.C., so it's in the best interest of the children to have a car. Well, the car, again, is an asset of Mrs. Clish. Maintenance to the car only applies to maintain that asset. And throughout this, throughout the judgment of absolute divorce, and in this particular circumstance, there seems to be a different standard applied. It seems like the court applied a best interest standard.  the parent to have a car. But that is not the standard by which child support is awarded.  The standard by which child support should be awarded was actually correctly stated in the judgment of absolute divorce. On page 45 of the judgment of absolute divorce, the court said, the court will only award child support for expenses that reflect the actual family experience and the reasonable needs of the children. And that is primarily for the benefit of the children and is not speculative. So even the court stated that it has to be primarily for the benefit of the children.  The court further than went on the same page that said child support payments are for the benefit of the children, not the mother. Other issues that we raised in our...

And when you compare, for instance, a capital improvement or even a payment towards the principal of the mortgage versus rent, for example, that provides housing, the benefit derived by the person receiving the child support is entirely different.  So when someone receives child support for a mortgage, the benefit is even more than a capital improvement, like I tried to explain earlier, but maybe not so clearly, in that it increases the value of that asset. By paying the interest on the mortgage, it maintains that asset and allows the person to live in that house because you're paying the interest part. If Mrs. Clish, I agree with you, if Mrs. Clish had rented,  a home instead of choosing to buy a home, the analysis would be different because a benefit to her is entirely different in that circumstance. While there's no case that specifically other than the one in Pennsylvania, we cited DC that says, we're gonna make an exact distinction between mortgage and interest. The fact of the matter is, is by analogy, if we can agree that capital improvements can't get child support for capital improvements because it doesn't primarily benefit the children,  And the benefit derived is to the title holder, the principle of law is exactly the same when someone receives child support for the mortgage portion of the principle that only goes to increase the value of that asset.  And to point out the other part of what we think there was an abuse of discretion was that the court has Mr. Clish paying 100% of the entire mortgage expense for the half the time the children are with Mrs. Clish. And that just seems, it's an abuse of discretion, is unreasonable.",

The applicable standard of review for the Court of Appeals to apply in reviewing the trial court's child support decision is abuse of discretion. The trial court has broad discretion in making child support decisions. Absent a showing of abuse of discretion, such decisions, both under the statutory guideline and independent of the guideline, as in this case, will not be disturbed on appeal.  As this court stated in the case of Johnson versus United States in 1979, they're prepared to countenance imperfections in the trial court's exercise of discretion to enjoy more fully the advantages of making the determination discretionary. Furthermore, the court of appeals is to defer to the trial court's findings of fact, unless they are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them.  There's also the issue in this case of whether the trial court's decision to apportion the fees for the parent coordinator with Mr. Clish paying 75% of those fees and Ms. Sears paying 25% of those fees was appropriate.

And when the family is intact, that lifestyle is very much dictated by the parent who has the higher earning salary, in this case, Mr. Klisch. The very principle of child support, the way that it is structured in the District of Columbia for children  of parents of all income levels is using the income shares model. The income shares model does look at both parents' incomes. And in particular, it's actually federal regulations that require states in their child support guidelines to ensure that the guidelines are reflective of the parent who has the duty to pay child support, which is in this case- Well, let me ask you about that for a moment because",

And that standard of living of the child can not only include bare necessities, but also the comforts and luxuries of life. The child's reasonable expenses or necessities may vary with the financial status of the family, the customs, the family's social circle, and the needs of those particular children.

But the suggestion is that there didn't need to be this 90-10 split in order for the children to maintain the lifestyle that they had had if only your client had been expected to pay something closer to what she  would pay if she were a single parent earning what she earns, for example. No one would get away with paying merely, what is the figure, $800 a month. I don't know what it is. I won't debate you on that. But I see the point.

The Prisco case was a case where the case was before the court on a motion to modify child support. Child support had very recently been set by a trial court in Fairfax County. So there was a very short period of time between that prior child support order and the motion to modify child support that was pending. And the court determined that  The record did not support that there had been a material change in circumstances.

I would be concerned about a legal principle that stands for that because, in effect, it puts a disincentive on a parent from choosing to own a home  and provide the stability to the children that may come with having a home in one neighborhood for a longer period of time, rather than a rental property where the parent may, you know, may rental prices can increase, they might get pushed out of a neighborhood, there could be all sorts of other  ripple effects that would arguably be negative and not for the best interests of these children that would come from a legal sort of a black line along those cases. And it would really impact, I fear, parents across the board in the decisions that they felt that they could make based off of what they can afford if they know that the principal portion of a mortgage payment is somehow going to be cut out  you know, D.C. housing expenses are expensive and it is what it is. And I think the court exercised appropriate discretion in this case by, you know, allocating sort of the bare minimum that Ms. Clish needed to, or Ms. Sears needed to pay in order to remain in the Cleveland Park neighborhood for these children so that they could remain in the neighborhood they had known their whole life. The court did not include costs for home maintenance,  did not include sort of any extras in the housing expense category. The only expense that was included was that mortgage payment, which Ms. Sears had no way of, no other alternative to minimize that other than potentially moving much further away in order to have a house of significantly lower cost. She would have needed to move probably multiple neighborhoods away  or live in a much smaller rental property. And these children had grown up their entire lives in a home down the block that cost $3.9 million in 2008. That is what they were used to. And Ms. Sears bought a property worth only 1.225 million. That's what she purchased it for. It's not even a comparable  home to what the children had known their entire lives and what they still know when they're with Mr. Klisch on his custodial time. Part of the purpose of child support is to help to mitigate against severe differences between the children's lifestyles when they're with each parent so that the children aren't having completely different experiences with mom versus with dad and that the children aren't  concerned that mom is needing to look at her checkbook every month and be worried about how she's going to pay the bills when dad clearly in this case does not have that concern.

And the rest is not only Mr. Klisch's problem, remember, he's paying 100% of the children's expenses when they're in his care. He's paying 90% under this order, 90% of the children's expenses were in her care. And in fact, the court ordered him to pay 100% of the mortgage.  When it's in her care I mean the court said and it's most ruling promotion to alter our men the court recognizes plaintiff may see a return of investment. Over time, the court sees the court says didn't assess any maintenance costs to Mr. Because it would be unfair, but for him paying all the mortgage and that's simply.  The court respectfully disregarded the law. The fact that the Prisco case is a modification case is not relevant. It's the principles of law set forth in the Prisco case. And so it's not a matter of  What is in, what is the motivation? I don't think it should be the policy of determining the motivation of a, and whether they determine to rent or buy, because if they buy, they know that they might not get child support for the principal portion of their mortgage payment. That should not be a consideration. What should be a consideration is the best interest of the child, right?",

We try to restore them as best we can to the situation they would have been in had this divorce not occurred. And it seems to me that Judge Deal is absolutely right. If you're going to try to do that for these kids,  and have them experience all the benefits they had when both parents were together and both incomes were fully used towards them, that you should divide it up in a way that maximally benefits the children. Your client made it clear at some point in the trial that this wasn't a matter of whether he could afford this or not. We're not talking about a balance that's hurting him from what his testimony is.  And finally, I would note, you keep using this $345,000 figure.

That alone, you know,  Well, the court said it was improper shifting, which is just one of many reasons why the court can reverse in this instance, when it talks about the evidentiary basis of what it accepted as evidence and based upon in perpetuity. After the date of separation, Mrs. Clish takes the children to indoor skydiving and then says, well, indoor skydiving, which we've never done before,  I've done this, and I anticipate doing it three or four times a year.

And the nature of this car theft is so impromptu, last-minute, improvised, that it doesn't look like the kind of thing that could have been planned in advance. Moreover, when you look at that 43-second phone call, I've actually been practicing to see how much I could say or how much I could have a conversation with someone in 43 seconds. If, in fact, Mr. Gregory were in the neighborhood because he had somehow conspired  to do this car theft or do robberies in advance with Mr. Sutton, there's absolutely no need to have a 43-second long phone call. If it's just about, hey, I grabbed a car, where are you? Let me pick you up. That takes much less time, whereas 43 seconds is ample time for a  like hey you know Sutton who's been headed to go to Sam's house also where Gregory's playing poker or smoking weed or whatever may be going on he's like hey man like you know want to go for a spin no I'm in the middle of my poker game um how about we meet an hour later yeah let's meet at Pete's place up near Fort Totten there's quite a lot that can be said in 43 seconds but if in fact Mr. Gregory had been planning this with Sutton there's no need for a long phone call at that  Particularly it might be, hey, I'm over here on the corner.",

And that really points to a big flaw in the government's theory that Gregory is there all along and is the getaway driver because  you know, oh, so he's there, and then he's not there, and then he's there, and then he's not there. It's also perfectly consistent with an idea that Gregory is continuing to do whatever he was doing, not joining Sutton at 3.55 or 3.57 or 4.15 in the afternoon. Maybe Sutton's picked up another buddy, and that they then meet up sometime later, and yes, they're together. It looks like they're together in Maryland.

    "text": " Well, I think Your Honor, whether the jury didn't believe what Mr. Miranda said or thought that what he said was too uncertain to link Mr. Gregory and Mr. Sutton to what happened to him.  The argument that Mr Gregory's making here doesn't depend on ignoring all of Miranda's evidence, because even, even if you were to take what Miranda said that the person who robbed him got into the passenger seat and drove away so he assumed that there was another driver.  Once again, we don't have anything linking that person to Mr. Gregory, and Miranda had the opportunity to identify Mr. Gregory in a show up shortly afterwards, and you didn't identify him. So we just don't have enough. Maybe yes, maybe it was Mr. Gregory driving the getaway car, but maybe it was some other friend of Mr. Sutton's, or maybe it was a Nissan Murano that coincidentally was in the same area as a Nissan Rogue.  But the key is that we don't know, and we're relying on speculation. We're kind of guessing. We're saying, well, maybe probably this. So then probably this and probably this. And well, this one is probably wrong then. And together, it just doesn't come into enough to get us to actual reasonable inferences that Gregory was a part of this, and certainly not that Gregory was a part of this from the very start.  Because once again, we have Sutton trying to reach Gregory. We have no idea what that's about. And if they really had planned this whole thing out, I mean, you look at the nature of the crimes, they're very impromptu, very opportunistic. This idea that, you know, oh, let's go out together and commit robberies today. And, oh, I happen to see a car, so, you know, grabbing this car. And, oh, I happen to find this guy. I mean, you,  That is not a well-orchestrated machine. And had they planned it all, why wouldn't Gregory have answered any of Sutton's phone calls earlier in the day?

Your Honor, Mr. Sutton's argument is that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was in either actual or constructive possession of a firearm at a time of the aggravated assault in this case. And that is at the time of the collision with Ms. Navarro's  vehicle. The government failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt the wall-armed enhancement to aggravated assault while armed and thus the accompanying possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. The government argues in their brief that the aggravated assault occurred prior to the collision, such that the relevant inquiry is the location of the firearm in the car before the collision. And this is from the government's brief, page 45.  the aggravated not after the crash, but just before it. Also on page 45, the relevant inquiry was whether the gun was readily available to Sutton up to the moment of the crash, not afterwards. To find Mr. Sutton guilty of aggravated assault while armed with a firearm, the jury would have to engage in conjecture and assumption that Sutton was in actual or constructive possession of a firearm at the time of the aggravated assault.

    "text": "Pretty much, Your Honor. The point is that during the commission of the offense, which is the relevant time period here, the government has not provided any basis for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt  that Mr. Sutton had possession of the firearm or could have reached the firearm. In fact, the government brief suggests the possibility the gun could easily have been kept in a compartment accessible to the driver, such as a center console or the glove compartment.  It just as easily, the gun could have been down Mr. Gregory's pants, which is where it was ultimately recovered. What was Farafino's testimony about which one of the two had the gun when they left? His testimony was that the individual with tattoos was the one that came up ultimately and finally got the gun back without the magazine and without the bullets. Which one is that? That is Mr. Gregory.  So the testimony and evidence at trial was that the gun belonged to Mr. Gregory, not to Mr. Sutton. The search warrant of Mr. Sutton's residence did not find the gun. The evidence linking the gun to Mr. Gregory was found during the search warrant of his home. And Mr. Gregory was the one who's crawling out of the woods injured and with the gun on his person.  So this is a significant crash, this crime, this aggravated assault. Indeed, in the government closing, the government says those cars were smushed, destroyed, both the Nissan and the car Ms. Navarro was in. How do you cause that much damage unless you were going exceptionally fast? You don't. That's not a fender bender. So our argument is airbags are deployed. There's blood everywhere.  It's an enormous crash, and there's just no evidence at the time of the offense where that gun is. It's particularly confusing to a jury where the gun is not what caused the injuries.",

    "text": " Good morning. May it please the Court, Nick Coleman for the United States. I'd like to begin by addressing Mr. Gregory's arguments before proceeding to address Mr. Sutton's arguments about the well-armed component.  I think it's important to note with respect to Mr. Gregory's argument that I'll begin with what he concedes. He concedes, I think he must, that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that he is the one who assists Mr. Sutton in getting the gun back from Mr. Farafino in Maryland.  He concedes, as he must, that he is then in the car with Mr. Sutton during the subsequent high-speed chase from the police, the crash with Ms. Navarro's vehicle, and then his flight and capture with the gun that lacks the magazine and the ammunition. So his argument appears to be that  There was not sufficient evidence for the jury, however, to conclude anything other than that he may have simply innocently gotten into the car after the last attempted armed robbery, or rather armed robbery in the district just before the incident with Mr. Ferrafino. I think there was more than sufficient evidence, however, for the government, rather for the jury to conclude otherwise.  beginning with the fact that with the theft of Mr. Casas' car, we have the 43 second call right around the same time. We have cell site evidence showing that both men, Mr. Gregory and Mr. Sutton, their cell phones are connecting with the tower that is essentially right at that location.  Neither one of them lives anywhere near there. The cell site evidence that was submitted to the jury showed that there were multiple towers, that would have been far closer to their addresses.  And thus, again, although one could posit an innocent explanation for each individual piece of evidence there, taken together, particularly given that the jury has the right to draw a reasonable inferences, it certainly had a sufficient basis to infer that these two men were working together both before and after the theft of Mr. Casas' car. In addition,  The evidence was pretty overwhelming that Mr. Gregory provided the lone gun that was used in the various armed robberies. He certainly is the one, he can't deny that he was caught with the magazine-less gun, and he certainly can't deny that that was the one that was used by Mr. Sutton in the failed attempt to rob Mr. Farafino.  He cannot also deny that an ammunition and a magazine matching that gun were found at his residence, that during a jail call with his girlfriend, he acknowledged that that was, when she said that was your clip, he is angry that the police discovered it. In addition, if you look at the descriptions of the gun that was given by the various victims, Mr. Perkins was the most,  incriminating this, he specifically describes the gun that is pointed in his face as a 40 caliber Glock, which is the gun that is found on Mr. Gregory. He, Mr. Perkins testifies that he used to be in the Marine Corps and he's very familiar with guns. So he's able to give a very specific, precise description of the gun that is later, in fact, recovered from Mr. Gregory.  The other two victims, actually the other three victims all described the gun consistently or pretty consistently with that gun. Certainly Mr. Rosales, I think says that he thought it was perhaps a 45, but he acknowledges that he doesn't know guns all that well. But all of the evidence is that there was only one gun. Now I know that Mr. Gregory argues  Uh, that, uh, although only one gun was ever seen or used during the Farafino incident, well, perhaps they left one behind. We submit that there was never any evidence of a second gun. And so what this, the jury was certainly entitled to conclude that there was only one gun and it was provided by Mr. Gregory, which, uh, it was a very powerful piece of evidence that these two men were working together from the very beginning that they planned this together. Uh, and that Mr. Gregory.  uh, provided the gun, Mr. Sutton, uh, was the one who acquired the ride, namely the stolen vehicle that they needed to use to, uh, conduct this series of crimes. Um, if there aren't any further questions about the sufficiency of the evidence, uh, for Mr. Gregory's conviction, I'd like to proceed to, uh, Mr. Sutton's arguments.",

    "text": "And that's the phone call, is what I'm positive.  Right. So there actually, I guess I respectfully disagree with Ms. Basker about the interpretation of the phone records between the two men before Mr. Acosta's car is robbed. In fact, if you take a look at the phone records, it appears that there is a completed call, a duration of about seven seconds, but it says that it's completed. If you look at the phone records from about  less than two hours before the robbery takes place. Now the remaining calls from Mr. Sutton to Mr. Gregory go to voicemail. We do know that, but the very first call does appear to be completed. We do know that Mr. Sutton Lee apparently goes to voicemail several times.  Uh, the phone records also do show that Mr. Gregory accesses his voicemail. Uh, so I think in fact, the jury had evidence here to conclude, uh, that the two men were in communication with each other even, you know, well before, uh, Mr. Costa's car stolen. I think also one, a very important point to make, uh, here is that under Pinkerton liability,  The two men didn't necessarily have to specifically agree to steal Mr. Casas' car, provided that the crime committed by Mr. Sutton was in furtherance of their conspiracy, and it was a conspiracy to commit armed robberies, and it was reasonably foreseeable.  Then he would be liable, even if the jury couldn't conclude that the men specifically discussed stealing Mr causes car or something exactly like it. So, under Pinkerton liability he can still be, and we would certainly submit here.  The jury did convict the two men of the conspiracy to commit armed robberies. Stealing a vehicle to carry those out is certainly in furtherance of that conspiracy, because after all, a stolen car can't be traced back to the robbers in the same way that using your own car or a car belonging to a friend or family member could be.  I think here, again, though, I think the jury, the coincidence that these two men are in that location at the exact time of the robbery, and then either during or immediately after Mr. Kausas' car is stolen, they are communicating for 43 seconds, which we would submit is perfectly consistent with the idea. I'm sorry, go ahead. Just about the evidence.",

Their home addresses and the address of Mr., I think it's Mr. Sutton's mother, because that's where he's arrested, are certainly given and their locations are shown. Those addresses are nowhere near this location, certainly to the point where you wouldn't expect, if they were making any phone calls in that area, they would not have connected to that tower. Their addresses certainly aren't any, they aren't.  sufficiently close that you would think they'd just be walking around and their cell phones would accidentally connect with that. Again, you know, the individual piece of evidence that their cell phones are connecting to that tower at that time, is it, is it capable by itself of some hypothesis that, that  Mr. Gregory had no idea what was going on. Theoretically, one could hypothesize such a thing. But again, the jury, particularly in light of all the other evidence, was certainly entitled not to accept such a hypothesis and to instead accept the far more reasonable, we would submit, explanation, which is that these two men had coordinated this.  their activities throughout the rest of the afternoon certainly show pretty tightly coordinated activity.",

There's certainly no evidence to suggest he brings his own gun to this series of armed robberies. He immediately after taking Mr. Casas' car, so as we can tell, is then immediately, literally at that moment, it's Mr. Gregory who calls him on his phone.  First, there is, he's the one who initiates that call and the Mr Sutton has to call him back, which, again, we submit in light of all the other evidence suggests these two men are now they are coordinating at this time they expect that this is how the ride is getting picked up.  During the remainder of the day, we also know that because Mr. Casas' car, they don't have the key fob, so it has to be left running. It means that one of them had to be minding that car, otherwise they would risk its loss or that the police would come upon it. So it stands to reason that Mr. Sutton would not have wanted to leave his getaway car without someone to mind it.

The gun, however, and losing that gun was obviously important enough to Mr. Gregory that he really wanted to get it back. We do know that Mr. Sutton called him during that incident.  And rather than just leave that gun with Mr Ferrapino after he disarmed Mr Sutton. It's obviously important enough to Mr Gregor that he wants to go out and try to get it back which he succeeds in doing.  Uh, but, you know, there, I think what that's what that again shows, I think, is that, you know, there is a fair amount of coordination between these two men, because when something goes wrong, uh, they don't just scurry away. They work together, uh, and they go together to go try to get the gun back, which they do succeed in doing.  Um, one point I did want to make, uh, in response to something before I forget, uh, that, uh, appellant Gregory argued with respect to whether there was someone in the car, uh, Mr. Perkins testimony, and this is on page 39, I believe of the August 1st, uh, uh,  a transcript. And if you look at what he says is at the very top of the page, he says, I seen him. This is presumably Sutton. This is the robber getting in the vehicle. I didn't see nobody else in the vehicle. I couldn't see in the vehicle.  So what he's saying is he's not saying I got a good look inside the car and there was no one else there he says I couldn't see in the vehicle. So, it's true he doesn't specifically see the second person there. But he's not saying that. Indeed, there was no one there.  And again, I think a jury with the evidence that it had certainly had an ample basis to conclude that in fact, Mr. Gregory was present inside that car as he was throughout the rest of that afternoon.  If there aren't any further questions about Mr. Gregory's arguments, I'd like to proceed to Mr. Sutton's arguments with respect to the well-armed enhancement. Well, I did want to ask you about the point in Mr. Gregory's reply brief, I guess, about the government's concession on",

I actually, I do, having reread the Ambank decision in Byrd and its discussion of Arnold on which Galbraith relied, I do think that it probably is the case that Galbraith has been substantially undermined. We did make the concession. And again, I apologize, we did not.  sort of, we did not connect the dots there probably as well as we could have and could have made an argument, yes, that Byrd does undermine Galbraith. You know, this court hasn't addressed the question of whether UUV and theft of the same car should merge since Galbraith. So, you know, again,  It won't affect the sentences in this case because of course, following the statutory command, the judge ran both of those sentences concurrently. I do agree with Ms. Basker that it is hard to see how Galbraith could remain good law, but obviously we did say what we said in our brief. Turning to Mr. Sutton's arguments with respect to the well-armed component, I think,  If the argument here is simply, was there a sufficient factual basis to conclude that the gun was at least readily available to Mr. Sutton during the commission of defense, we respectfully submit that the jury had a more than sufficient basis to do so. Even if we were to assume, for example, that the gun was still with Mr. Gregory,  We submit it still readily available to Mr. Sutton. Mr. Gregory, the DNA evidence and all, and the evidence from the police officers who saw the car is that Mr. Gregory, assuming, again, with the DNA evidence shows it's him, he's in the front seat with Mr. Sutton, the driver.  During the day, as I was arguing with respect to, and as the government argued at trial, every time Mr. Sutton needed the gun, Mr. Gregory is handing it to him. So I think it certainly ready availability doesn't require that your cohort not have the gun. It just, you know, again, it doesn't have to be within arm's reach. Yes, it is. If you're in the driver's seat, you can reach it and your,  cohort can hand it to you. So I think even if it's in Mr. Gregory's waistband or if he's got it in his hands or whatever, it's still readily available to Mr. Sutton. I'm not sure. I'm sorry.

I think, you know, and I submit this court, I'm not aware of any decision in which this court has held  that a gun cannot be readily available to two people or that it can't be readily available to the driver even if the passenger happens to have it with him. I'm certainly not aware of such a decision and I don't think that one is necessary. I think in that case, it can certainly be readily available to both people.  I think the argument that perhaps the gun, I certainly don't think that there is any reason that the jury should have been compelled to conclude that the gun went flying such that, even if one were to determine that it's the exact second of the crash that constitutes the assault as opposed to the activity that led to the crash plus the crash.  I'm not sure that this court has split hairs to that degree in trying to analyze when an offense takes place. But in any event, I think the idea that the gun necessarily went flying such that it couldn't have been available to Mr. Sutton, it's speculative. And I certainly don't think that that's what the jury was required to conclude here.  Uh, it was instead, it was readily available to him, uh, when he committed the, uh, aggravated assault and thus, uh, you know, under the statute, uh, it applies. Um, I'm not, the appellate has at times sort of suggested, although I'm not sure if he has specifically argued here that, um, the fact that the, uh, aggravated assault  was sort of accomplished with the car precludes a finding that he was armed with a firearm at the time. The  The while-armed enhancement does not require that a weapon be used during the course of an offense. It simply requires that the perpetrator either have been armed with or have readily available to him the gun. And this court's decisions, cases like Jamison and Washington, have pretty specifically held that a weapon does not have to be used during the commission of an offense for the while-armed enhancement to apply.  Uh, we submit that in the absence of, uh, you know, any ruling to the contrary, that there's no due process problem here, uh, or, or any other legal impediment to applying the while armed enhancement. Uh, there was a sufficient basis for the jury, uh, to make that finding. Uh, and so we would respectfully submit that, uh, that aspect of Mr. Sutton's conviction should be affirmed.

    "text": "Yes, thank you, Your Honor. I'd like to very briefly address possible four points that came up in the government's argument regarding the location at the time of the theft, the phone records, the gun or guns, and the Maryland incident.  First, in terms of the location where they were both near Mr. Kassa's home at the time of the theft, the pre-pandemic, many of us spent time for very innocent reasons in neighborhoods outside of where we actually lived. And many of us have friends who live in other neighborhoods. And the government, as Judge Deal pointed out, did not put on any  evidence phone records or otherwise that that this was a neighborhood that there was no innocent reason why they might be there that they didn't normally hang out there. And I submit that it is quite plausible that they did in fact have reasons to be there, perhaps mutual friend who lived in the neighborhood or something to that effect.  On the phone records, I don't believe that the phone records indicate that Mr. Gregory accessed his voicemail as the government indicated. I've been looking back at them. And while it does show when a phone call goes into voicemail, it is not clear to me from those phone records that it shows  Mr. Gregory checking his voicemail or whether there are any voicemail messages there. And I'd like to direct the court's attention to Mr. Gregory's opening brief, page 15, footnote one, that talks in a little more detail than I have time for right now about an anomaly with this phone call where the government says there was one completed phone call about 12-14  in the afternoon of seven seconds. The entry right after that makes no sense in any way whatsoever of looking at the records. And I submit to the court that it's actually an error and is intended to indicate that the 12-14 phone call, in fact, did go to voicemail. Because otherwise, there's absolutely no explanation for a phone call listed the following day in the same location at exactly that time, but one hour later.  So I do explain that a little bit more and point out specifically the entries in that footnote in the opening brief regarding the gun.  Even if the government is correct that the jury could conclude reasonably that there was only one gun and that the gun that Sutton used came from Gregory, there's still no evidence that this was given by Gregory to Sutton for the purpose of furthering any plan to commit robberies. And it's quite possible maybe the reason they were hanging out in the Petworth area was that there  that Sutton was planning to try to buy crack from someone. Maybe he was planning to buy crack from Perkins, who had a history of that and needed a gun for protection. And there's no evidence that Gregory envisioned any robbery-related or theft-related use of that gun, even if he did provide it. But as argued in our brief, we submitted still speculation that there was one gun and that Gregory provided it.  And then just in terms of the Maryland incident, the government really relies very heavily on the fact that Gregory was involved there. But 90 minutes passed between that incident and the beginning of all of this in DC, which is more than enough time for Gregory to have joined and been a part of that Maryland incident without having been a part of  the prior episodes and just because there may be evidence that they work together in Maryland, that crime itself is not charged here, and it is not enough to show that they were working together, the entire time.  And as Judge Deal pointed out, even if the court were to conclude that Gregory was a part of the robberies in D.C., there's also not enough evidence that this was planned in advance and that he had any role whatsoever beforehand, before the taking of the car that led to the taking of the car. So I see that I am out of time. I would like to request this court reverse Mr. Gregory's convictions for  theft, robbery, assault, conspiracy to commit robbery and unauthorized use of a vehicle, or in the alternative, to merge the convictions as argued in Mr. Gregory's brief. Thank you very much. Thank you, Ms.",

The government suggests that this court hasn't split hairs when determining when an offense takes place. In fact, the government cites to the case of Frye in their own brief where the court held that an appellant is guilty only of attempted aggravated assault while armed.  where he drove his vehicle at a victim but would have been found guilty had he actually succeeded in hitting the victim's car with his own and causing injuries. He would have been found guilty of actual aggravated assault while armed. So the government has made that distinction. Second, we understand that the while armed enhancement  does not require that the weapon be used in an offense, but be readily available. Our argument is that there is a huge difference between standing side by side with a companion and saying, hey, hand me that gun and crashing at a high speed into another car. There were injuries here to all parties. There was blood on the inside of the car.  the white Nissan, the passenger side was crumpled to the point where the doors could not open, the airbags were all deployed.

It's just the government has not shown that element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  So that's that's on the one hand, on the javelin.
