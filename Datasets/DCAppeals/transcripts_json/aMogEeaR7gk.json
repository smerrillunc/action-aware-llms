    "text": "Good morning, your honors. Benjamin Boscollo for Mr. Quaranta. This is a very simple question, and I suspect I will not use all of my time, but I'd like to reserve three minutes for rebuttal.  Mr. Carranza has a work-related concussion and an optic nerve injury. The history of this case is well known to this court, so I'm not going to recite it here other than to say that his claim for permanent partial disability benefits was denied and affirmed at all levels years ago.  Within the three-year statutory period, that condition deteriorated, and he sought additional benefits for a change in condition. And the changed condition was not for any permanent partial disability. And although it appears to Mr. Carranza that the agency thinks he's trying to re-litigate the issue of whether his retirement constituted a voluntary limitation of income, that's simply not the case.  His claim initially in 2017 was for permanent and partial disability. The claim that he sought, the benefits that he seeks now are for temporary and total. The issue that's before the court is very narrow and that's where- Can I ask you, Mr. Bustolo, is he also seeking medical benefits?",

I'm not saying that Mr Toronto will win this period of temporary and total disability the only issue before the ALJ initially in the CRB was whether or not there was reason to believe that a change in condition had occurred, and it's not the change of the injury.  it's the change of the disabling effects, right? And so the claim that had been denied was for permanent disability. The claim that had been denied was for partial disability. The claim that's being put forth is for temporary disability and for total disability. And for the life of Mr. Carranza, he finds it hard to understand why  when you have a period of temporary and total disability, that doesn't at least raise an issue of whether or not there's been a change in condition because that's, that's really the question here is the reason to believe.

It is certainly not uncommon in the world of workers' compensation for a party to say, I'm going to get this surgical procedure and I want temporary total disability benefits during the recuperative period, which is undetermined depending on how well the procedure goes, how tough the injured worker is.  Sometimes it's six days, sometimes it's six weeks, sometimes it's six months, sometimes it's six years. I don't think that would be the case with Mr. Carranza. But if that were the concern of the ALJ, that's really an issue of evidence that he didn't prove that there was going to be a period of temporary disability afterwards. The real problem here is, I proffered, that's what he was going to say. The CRB said, we accept the proffer, but it was harmless error.

It's quite common that when a doctor says, you need this surgery and you're going to be laid up for some period of time, that an injured worker says, if I'm not going to be paid, I can't get it done. I got bills to pay and I got families to take care of.  And so this is not uncommon at all in the world of workers' compensation, where whether or not the disability that follows a surgical procedure is going to be paid is one of the facts that an injured worker considers when they decide whether or not to actually have the procedure or just live with it. So yes, absolutely happens all the time in every jurisdiction where I practice, and this is no different. And listen, these are all  questions of fact that should be supported by a record or not a record. We're really at the question about whether or not there was enough here for the ALJ to believe that we should have a hearing to flesh all this stuff out. And they've basically said no. And to go back to the question that Judge Deal was asking me about harmful error.  I agree, they didn't say specifically we accept that he was going to be temporarily and totally disabled, but there was a proffer that he was going to be temporarily and totally disabled. And looking at the evidence in the light most favorable to him and assessing whether or not that gives rise to a reason to believe that there may be a change of condition, I think not addressing that proffer either  by the ALJ, which is really not what's before you, or the CRB's kind of conclusory statement that there's a proffer about a change in condition, but not considering that change, that proffer is harmless error, it's circular logic.

Because the way you're describing it now, your claim was not really, here's Mr. Quaranto's current condition and it's disabling and he wants benefits, not just medical benefits, but wage loss benefits.  Rather, you're saying your claim was, and your proffer was, he's got to have the surgery for medical reasons. And once he has the surgery, he will be disabled. And that's my claim. And my proffer is, that's the nature of the proffer. And when I'm looking at the proffer, first of all, the claim seems to be, the administrative law judge is talking to you and saying, so the TPD would be from present, from June 19, and then you say 6-19, to present and continuing, and you say correct.  And then you make some statements about the worsening of his condition, not the consequences of his medical treatment.  Now there is a part later, you know, a little bit later where you say he's going to require active care and they don't know how the surgery is going to go. So there's a little bit that's forward looking, but I hadn't really understood that your claim was contingent and future in this way. And I'm not sure that the ALJ or the CRB did either. We'll find out, I guess, whether your opponent did.

And I think that the,  a voluntary limitation of income finding is a problem for him on the partial disability. Clearly in the briefs at the CRB and maybe imprecise language by his counsel at the hearing, that issue of the temporary total during the recuperative period was really kind of the gravamen of the change of condition and certainly was at the CRB.

I mean, he'll have had a surgical operation, and he'll have to recuperate, and he'll have an open or a closed surgical incision. And his condition will be different post-medical procedure if he's allowed to have it at employer expense.  But is it your view that for him to have a temporary total disability claim arising from that procedure, he has to show first that his condition got worse, triggering the need for the procedure? Because if I recall correctly, although the 2014 report by Dr. Crutchfield, I don't see it as in our current record, it recommended this procedure surgically and he did not take it.  And so if all that happens is, you know, at a time, you know, if the time of the original litigation, he needed the procedure according to the doctor, he didn't take it. And then nothing really changes except that he decides ultimately he is gonna have the procedure, but his condition doesn't worsen.

He could, I thought you were gonna ask me a different question which is, does this allow him to somehow get back to where he was on partial disability. And I don't know the answer to that question but that's not really what's before the court today what's before the court is this period of temporary disability associated with the medical care, and whether or not that.  Whether or not that allegation and claim by Mr. Carranza gives rise to a reason to believe that there's been a change in condition. It's a very soft standard. And again, he could lose this on the record. All the questions you're asking, the ALJ could say, I don't find his complaint that he got worse credible. I don't find that the surgery is going to render him intemporarily and totally disabled. But that's not the issue here.

But there's, there's a case called Smith, which stands for the proposition that once an injured worker receives permanent and partial disability benefits.  for a scheduled injury, they are no longer entitled to temporary and total disability benefits. The Cherrydale case, which is a case that this court says, unless there's some unexpected and unforeseen worsening of the condition, and then Smith no longer governs. And you can get another period of temporary and total disability after the permanent and partial disability benefits for a scheduled member were paid.  Even on the assumption, the reason that we get paid permanent partial disability benefits on a scheduled member in DC is there's a presumption there's going to be future wage loss because of that injury.  If the if the wage of the future wage loss is not exactly what was anticipated and I think in Cherrydale might have been a knee replacement case for someone had a scope and nobody thought there was ever going to be a total knee replacement and years later there was a total knee and a period of temporary total and some additional permanent partial that Mr. That the claimant actually got in that case.  work for Cherrydale Electric. So, yeah, there are very nuanced decisions throughout the history of the act based on the nature of the disability benefit being claimed. You can't pay, you know, the temporary and total is different than permanent and total, is different than permanent and partial, is different than temporary and partial.

    "text": " Let me also, and part of that is the nature of the impact of this early about the kind of anticipatory and perspective benefits and the nature of this modification provision in the statute. And I want to talk about the Terry Dale case that all goes together. So when a claim for permanent wage, permanent partial disability, either under the schedule or wage loss benefits is made,  the ALJ, the CLB considers what is anticipated. So at the time Mr. Paranta made his claim for permanency benefits, the surgery was already discussed. It was already recommended. It was anticipated. So if he had gotten an award for benefits, we would be in the same position where he would be requesting a modification for a worsening of condition.  seeking additional wage loss benefits. It's a very narrow kind of carve out once you've gotten an award to be requesting benefits. And as Mr. Bustle pointed out, there's a line of cases. And this is what we would have gotten to if this case had proceeded to an evidentiary hearing. And the Cherrydale case does talk about what is determined to be a worsening or an unexpected occurrence.  And essentially what the court has said is it really must be something that is unexpected. And I believe the wording uses something to the nature of an amputation.  So we're not talking about just a worsening or a deterioration or a surgery that he maybe didn't want to get back then but now wants to get now because it hurts a little bit more. The courts have said it is something of a significant nature that could not have been anticipated at the time of that permanency award, much like something like an amputation.",

Do you say zero workers' compensation for such a person because you want to punish the person for retiring? I don't quite, I don't see the,  why you would want to punish such a person or why you would want to foreclose a workers' comp claim. I get the idea that the person who raises such a claim shouldn't be able to try to get the wage loss measured against a pre-retirement high-paying job. I get that 100%. And that's sort of what I thought we were saying in our earlier decision in this case. I get that.

Judge McClease, Mr. Carranza did miss some limited period of time right after the injection. And he said he was there to testify about that. And then page three and four of my brief before the CRB, I specifically raise  the issue of temporary disability, both after the injection, and I said in my brief, these specific words, to the CRB. I had it and then I moved.  he is now not able to perform all of the duties of his current employment as a result of the work-related injury. Of all the unclear things I said in this case, I think nothing could be clearer than he's now saying that this injury prevents him from doing the duties of his current job, not his own thing. And yes, I think that I have a problem on total disability because of the prior  findings of this court, which is why it was partial disability, right? I claimed temporary partial. I raised it both during that short period of time after the injection and during the recuperative period. The footnote in my brief says, Mr. Carranta was sitting there at council table with me, ready to answer any questions of the court. If the ALJ was not clear on what specifically Mr. Carranta could not do now,  because of his work-related injury. So I specifically raised that, both after the injection and after the surgery, in my pleadings to the CRB. If it wasn't clear in the proffer, you know, sometimes when we're together and we're watching body language and it's clear to everybody that we're all talking about the same thing, our words don't necessarily make the greatest record, which they have not done here, number one. Franklin, I wanna talk about Franklin for just one second. The problem with Franklin is when she left her employment,  She deprived the employer of the opportunity to give her light duty while she was recuperating from carpal tunnel. Right. And so that employer could have eliminated her wage loss in another way besides paying workers' compensation benefits. Unfortunately, I know Franklin and Burge very well because they were both handled by my firm.  I handled Burge myself. Ms. Burge left professional basketball because of a skill set that the only one on this video conference has is Ms. Tarachi. She decided she wanted to be a mom, and that's why she stopped playing. And then when her back flared up, she did seek temporary and total disability benefits, but she had already left the employment to become a mom, and the court found when you decide to hang them up, they're no longer responsible for wage loss that happens after you have a baby.  And so I don't think either Franklin or Burge are anywhere close to Mr. Carranza's case. And temporary partial is different than permanent partial. And temporary disability is- I'm sorry, I just missed the distinction of Franklin.",

The counterclaim itself dealt specifically with Omid's assertion that there was a gap in the chain of title that eventually led to U.S. Bank.  And that gap in the chain of title meant that when they purchased the property during the condominium foreclosure sale, that they became the first deed of trust. There was no mortgage that they had to assume. That was the declaration that they wanted in their counterclaim.  That is a very different issue than what they moved on, on summary judgment. On summary judgment, the issue that they put forth in front of the judge was to seek a declaration that the first deed of trust was void under the DC law and the Chase Plaza, Lew, and 4700 Con case law. Once they raise that in their motion for summary judgment, you have a chance to respond.",

And so what we see now is a $63,000 sale price in all in omens own words in its counterclaim them believing that notwithstanding the language and the deed of trust that the sale.  was premised on the assumption of the mortgage. They specifically state that OMID through its managing member verifies that it was OMID's understanding that fee simple title acquired by OMID pursuant to the trustee's deed vested ownership of the property in OMID free and clear of the purchase money encumbrance or lien created by co-defendant Snowden based on the gap in the chain of title.  the trial court never dealt with that particular issue. And it's particularly relevant here in light of the RFP decision, which essentially states that if you assume the mortgage, the first deed of trust, then you can basically add on that amount to your foreclosure sale price to come up with a price and determine whether or not that's unconscionable.

And this court stated that that needed to be considered in the context of the price and that it's almost baked in the price. And this court found that there was no finding of unconscionability based on that temporal lens of when the sale took place alone. Now, I agree with you that that's baked into the price.",

And we cannot find that it would be unconscionable. And I ask that this court find that it is not unconscionable here. Moreover, as this court and I'm sorry, did you just ask us to find that it is not unconscionable?  No, sorry, I ask that this court affirm the finding of summary judgment, but I would also argue that there is no unconscionability here. Moreover, as this court noted in lieu, these super priority lien foreclosures generally produce a low sales price due to the inherent nature of the super priority lien, and that they encompass only generally a couple of thousand dollars worth of a lien and six month worth of dues. And so U.S. Bank is essentially requesting  a do over here. And as this court noted their frustrations are to be the solution to their frustrations is with the legislative process and not with the judiciary.  And so I think that one of the it's important to note that one of the hallmarks of unconscionability is that us bank has to assert that it lacks a meaningful choice and here it failed to take action to protect its lean in the wake of the chase Plaza decision by paying off the condo dues.  escrowing the funds, or even participating in the sale. I think that as a result of the Chase Plaza case, we have sophisticated institutional lenders that were put on notice that they needed to take proactive steps. And one could argue a nominal step of just submitting a couple thousand dollars to the association to pay off these dues. The statute is designed to coerce mortgage lenders that they need to take action. And U.S. Bank did nothing here.  And then after Omid asserted that- Ms.",

But I mean, to me, your argument and the argument in your brief that the notice of the sale is more important than the advertisement of the sale. I don't get that. Seems to me that the advertisement of the sale is much more important.  Because that's what goes out to the public. That's the one that according to the documents in the in the record was published in the Washington Post, and the one that sends the message to the world. Hey, if you buy this, you have to take on this this mortgage. So, I mean, why I mean and in in lieu and in 4700 Connecticut.  That was the erroneous or the misstatement about the sale being subject to the mortgage. That, too, was enough to send it back to the trial to the trial court. So we've got this. We've got that in this case. Why isn't why? Why is it? And that was clearly in front of of the trial judge at summary.  not so much in terms of the opposition to the motion for summary judgment, but in the motion for leave to amend and in the second amended complaint, which were both incorporated into the opposition to the motion for summary judgment. So why isn't that, even putting the incongruity issue to one side, why is that enough for a remand here?",

So that's what this court essentially notes in USB or RFP is that there is an uncertainty in the law, however. The notice of sale and to go to your statement of our argument is that.  It trumps the advertisement because it is what gives the borrowers and junior lien holders direct notice that they have a right of redemption pre-foreclosure sale, and that they can resolve this matter in its entirety by paying off the condominium lien, or at least the super priority portion. And so the notice of sale did not contain a misstatement, and it was sent directly to U.S. banks.  And the statute also gives weight to the notice of sale and that it's required to be recorded in public land records that's also a form of public notice and it has statutory requirements.  And US, excuse me, your honors, the association complied with all of its statutory requirements. The ad is merely a general notice requirement.

But those reasons were not raised if at all they weren't raised in the trial court until the later accounting portion of the case and therefore we would submit that they were not properly preserved for the purposes of appeal. And there's other, we also believe that.  They didn't properly support many of their issues on appeal with the record from the case below. For example, the eviction proceeding, there's no record of any that contains any of the filings in the eviction proceeding there's no record of the hearing transcripts and the hearings that that went on in the eviction proceeding.  That's really the appellant's responsibility to provide this court with the record.

Which is which is way later in the case, which is really the first time that they start trying to argue service with us.  other than the answer, which they didn't pursue when they responded to our summary judgment motion. With regards to the judgment order authorizing the sale, giving us summary judgment, they don't dispute that they obtained the mortgage. They don't dispute that they defaulted on the mortgage. Our position is that the statute limitation doesn't apply to an equitable claims like the ones that we asserted for judicial foreclosure.  And even if latches apply, they don't provide any evidence of prejudice from the delay. The period for latches under existing D.C. law would be 15 years from the date of the fault, which wouldn't have lapsed. The contracts were signed under seal. If any sort of limitations period did apply, it would have been extended 12 years, which would have lasted past the date the complaint was filed.  With regards to the order ratifying or accounting, they don't dispute that any of the distributions listed in the accounting were correct or that they didn't agree to pay those amounts when they signed the mortgage. With regards to the eviction case, they don't dispute that they were aware of the proceeding. They don't dispute that the property was conveyed to the purchaser who was a plaintiff in that proceeding.  and they don't show any facts in the record that would give them any entitlement to remain on the property after the property had been conveyed. Their failure to provide a record, like I said before, is most problematic in the eviction proceeding because it appears that there were hearings that they didn't attend in which we would argue that claims were abandoned, that those hearings were scheduled, the claims that were scheduled to be heard at those hearings were abandoned.  We just don't know from the record what exactly went on, other than we have affidavit as a service file.  And we get a judgment for an eviction. As I said before, it's their responsibility to provide the record. It doesn't exist, so there's nothing for them to point to for this court to find that there's any reversible error that was committed. For these reasons, we're asking this court to please affirm the lower court's three judgments. And unless Your Honor is going to make additional questions, I can wait for the rest of my time.",
