If we have technical difficulties, which sometimes do arise, please bear with us. We will try to fix them as quickly as possible. If I don't say that, the problems will arise. If I say it, I'm hoping I will stave off any issues.  So today we have two cases on our calendar. We have to reconstitute the panel after the first case so for the folks watching on YouTube. Again, bear with us there's going to be a slight pause in the proceedings. Before we call the second case.  But the first case on our calendar today is a consolidated case with four case numbers, 15 CF-1081 and 1083 is the direct appeal, 20 CO-232 and 233 is the appeal from the 23-110. It's DeMonta M. Chappelle versus the United States.  I understand that we're going to go forward with the direct appeal first. So Miss Persico, you are up. Please let us know how much time you would like for rebuttal. And we do. I'm just confirming we've got the government on the line, although we don't have a visual. Yes, Your Honor, I'm here.  Great. Thank you very much, Counsel. All right, Ms. Persico, when you're ready.",

I'd like to focus on the warrant issues in the supplemental brief and then go to the prejudice prong. As far as the warrants are concerned, there's three reasons  that the warrants have violated the Fourth Amendment warrant clause. First is the lack of probable cause. And as to probable cause, it's our position that the warrants in this case are even more egregious than they were in the Burns case, because unlike in Burns,  where the affidavit stated that witnesses had described specific text messages and phone calls to and from the defendant and the decedent. Here, with the possible exception of the location of Mr. Chappelle at the time of the murder, not one witness whose interview was described in the affidavit  said anything even remotely suggesting that they knew of texts or calls or photos or videos or any other digital content that was related to the murder. I'm sorry, counsel, to interrupt. What do you mean by the location?",

And the calls were made long before the decedent supposedly was to arrive at Burns' apartment.

Because in Burns, there was no time limit for it. They were asking for everything for, you know, for a period of time that did not fit the night of the murder. And in our case, you have a similar situation, but worse, because in our case,  They asked for, as to the AT&T warrant, they limited the time period for every, first they asked for everything, everything that's in the phone they want, they limited for a time period of six days. Now there's nothing, nothing in the affidavit that supports them finding that it was likely for them to find anything that they listed on that warrant  during a six day time period, except perhaps the GPS tracking, which Burns said there may have been probable cause for.

And I'm going to have to quote you, Judge Easterly, because I listened to that November 2019 oral argument over the weekend. And you yourself said during that argument that the government witnesses were, quote, compromised in pretty significant ways. And we had argued that they were substantially impeached.  You add to that the fact that there was no physical evidence linking Mr. Chappelle to the murder. They didn't have a gun linking him. They didn't have DNA. They didn't have fingerprints. They had nothing physically linking him to the murder. And then on top of that, you add the prosecutor's opening, closing, and rebuttal arguments, which are cited in more detail in the briefs. And so all of that,  evidence. You throw in the evidence from the wines, which were photos of Mr. Chappelle that the government suggested showed that he was wearing the same clothing that was worn by the shooter on the night of the murder. They introduced from the phone call logs showing that appellant had communicated  with Robert Brandon and with Larry Wallace, who were government witnesses against Mr. Chappelle. And you have, and you have the CSLI, the cell site information, and which extended into  a special agent Horan's drive test test. I mean, yeah, drive test testimony. So when you lump all of that together, you have a case by the government that is not strong witnesses who were impeached from here to Sunday. And I think I said this in the last argument, you have no physical evidence and you have the prosecutor hammering the photos, the, the, um,  cell site information and the contact logs and Special Agent Horan's testimony, you have the prosecutor hammering that in opening, closing and rebuttal.

So you put Riley aside because Riley said you need a warrant. Okay, fine. Even though that happened afterwards, it didn't change the fact that this detective should have known that these warrants did not satisfy probable cause, particularity, and the overbroad requirement.  I mean those requirements still held and that's what burns found that's why burns said.  that the good faith exception didn't apply. I mean, one difference between this case and Burns, which the decision at Burns emphasized, is assuming that the phone searched in Burns belonged to someone who was not a suspect at the time.",

So all of that is exactly the same. That language fits perfectly within Mr. Chappelle's case.

And then there are written orders. There are two written orders. There's a judgment and commitment order, and there's a SORA order. The judgment and commitment order has a time on it. It's 1657 or some particular time on it. The SORA order doesn't have a time on it.

And then this court's decisions in WM and subsequent cases  highlight that the mere fact that it's included as part of sentencing, that that's more of a ministerial function that's for the convenience and the best manner of informing the defendant, the offender, of his obligations. Now, getting back, I mean, related to this is that question of the fact that it's a condition of release. That does not  that does not mean it has become part of the sentence. I mean, there are plenty of civil orders or civil matters that are incorporated as conditions of release in sentencing orders. For example, a CPO or a stay away order. There might be an official one from the family court. The fact that the criminal judge says, as a condition, continue to stay away or even  which sometimes happens prospectively, a judge will say, as a condition of your probation, you are to abide by whatever orders the family court issues, even in the future, with respect to your relationships and so on.",

But I do think that given that it can occur in conjunction with sentencing and that that doesn't change its character and its independent nature and its civil nature and all that, they're related.  I understand that the question of the timing, you know, in the trial court, that was, I guess if you want to look at it as kind of our fallback argument, that we really did believe that this became effective at the time of the obligation existed, even if it wasn't imposed. The obligation to register existed at the time of a finding of guilt.  And the reason is, and that makes sense in the context of this statute, because the statute is clearly intending to have a first offender appear on the sex offender registration list. And if it were not, if the understanding was that the conviction had to be final and it could not be done immediately at the same time to require registration,  then there would be an automatic first free pass for every sex offender. And then second, or, and as a trial judge thought here, erroneously in our view, it would take the third assault on a young vulnerable victim in order to qualify for a lifetime registration, which just doesn't square. Can you walk me through that argument?",

The registration period shall start when a disposition described in 22-4001-3A occurs.

Is that what the government is saying? Because they're together, right? It's 3A sub I. It's either was convicted or found not guilty by reason of insanity, which is not a true not guilty.  If you were really not guilty, you would be acquitted, right? But if you're guilty, but there are these extenuating circumstances, you might be not guilty by reason of insanity.

    "text": "So let's see if you can help me with this. At times today, it seems like you think we have only two choices.  One is agree with what I thought was your broader position, which is the obligation to register as a sex offender and the judge's obligation to impose a sex offender registration order occur. Both of them are triggered at the time of the adjudication of guilt. That's one theory. It seems like at times today you have been suggesting that if we don't agree with that theory,  then the absurdities that you're pointing out about first-time offenders, and you have to get three in order to qualify for a lifetime offender, follow inevitably. So we have that binary choice. I had thought from your brief that you had a fallback argument that was in between those, that was even if the obligation to register as a sex offender, and even if the obligation to register as a sex offender  don't occur until a conviction has been imposed in the strong sense of adjudication of guilt and imposition of sentence. That nonetheless, that can happen. The judge can finish all that. Not only can, but must finish all that and then make the sex offender determination. So that in the first time offense, the judge would say, at the time of the adjudication of guilt, the judge would say, well, not the sex offender registration time yet.  But then at the time of sentencing, the judge would impose sentence on the criminal case, and then would say, OK, now it's time to think about sex offender registration. I have someone who has been convicted of a sex offender registration, because I've already imposed sentence. Now I'm going to impose a registration order, and the person now is required to register. And the same then would work in a case like this, where after imposing sentence in this case on the criminal component of sentencing,  the judge would look to the defendant then, not earlier, and say, okay, now what is the right kind of length, you know, duration of registration requirement now that this person has been convicted of, in the full sense of having sentence imposed on, you know, two qualifying offenses, the person is a lifetime offender. Do you think we have only two questions, options? Those three.",

I think the legislative history and the parsing of the language of the statute itself can support the notion that conviction occurs at the time of finding a guilt, and that that solves the problem that Apelli has raised. Alternatively, if the problem Apelli has flagged,  can be solved in the manner that the court just described and that I described in my brief. And that is that the criminal adjudication is made, the sentencing is made, and then the registration order is imposed. And I think that's, in fact, what we were talking about earlier, what actually happens most of the time. The problem is, or the issue is, and this addresses Judge Easterly's point, I think, about did I give something up to  too soon on the, don't I get, don't we get what we want for a first time offender? And that is, if you apply that logic in the first time offender situation, it has to apply in the second offender situation. There can't be, if someone can be forced to register because of an offense before the trial court right now,  And the minute they're sentenced, they then are forced to register or ordered to register the exact same procedure, the exact same reasoning happens on their second offense. And it was improper for this trial judge to look at that and say, I can't count the second one because it isn't finished. It's the exact same analysis. That's the point I was trying to make.",

And I think the difference is that in 4001-3A, that by definition refers to only one offense, a lifetime registration eligible offense. So you committed that offense.  As we try to explain, but I think could have possibly done a better job in front of the trial judge, in our view, disposition is used in the statute as kind of a shorthand in order to encompass all of the ways in which possible types of dispositions that could count. The trial court felt that had one concept of the definition of disposition that it  required a sentence and a judgment on that sentence. But the court shouldn't have been thinking along those lines because disposition is subject to many different meanings. But in this case, there are many ways in which there can be a disposition. There could be a commission of one registration offense 10 years ago and another second one right now. There could be a commission of two registration offenses against two different victims in the past,  There can be commission of two offenses against those victims now.

    "text": "I mean, I don't have an insight or an answer into that precise question why they use those precise words. However, I do think Your Honor kind of answered the question in the lead up to it by saying that they're effectively equivalent because B3 and B4 incorporate the definition of 3A, committed a registration offense.  They both, one, three, and four, all effectively use the term committed a registration offense. They are the same. And I think it was just a way to say, I mean, my best explanation is that it was a way to say there are many ways, there are many possible dispositions, there are many possible ways in which someone could have more than one prior offense. But it doesn't change the fact that  that I agree with the court, that it refers back to committed. And in that sense, the definitions are the same. So if committed causes a problem because of someone's view of when a conviction occurs, then it's the same whether it's a single offense or multiple offenses. Because B3 and B4 incorporate, by reference, 4001.3a, and that  which says committed a registration offense, there is no effective difference. We might have wished for greater clarity and chosen different words had we written it, but I think when you combine, understand that it hearkens back to the same definition and you understand the legislative history and the purpose of the act,  And third, understand that if it's interpreted the way this trial court interpreted it, the purpose, aim, and aim of the statute would be undermined. And it would also lead to anomalous results that we talked about in our brief about how out-of-jurisdiction folks might be treated differently than D.C. folks. And I think it's also, as a final thought, worth remembering, you know, that SORA was part of a nationwide push  to prevent sex offender recidivism. So the notion that DC law would somehow be devised to ensure that DC offenders got one free pass, or that two didn't mean two, two means three, just doesn't make any sense in the context of the statute as a whole.

And yet the court found a way to not treat him as a recidivist. So in that respect, I think, and not only that, the court itself, the trial court's own words betrayed her misunderstanding of it. Rather than understanding, I understand this isn't troubling the court now,  But rather than understanding that SORA certification was a civil and non-punitive matter, the judge said, well, actually, I don't see those as separate.

But D seems to indicate that it doesn't necessarily have to be from the court.  Right, and 22 4007 really seems to put the primary responsibility regarding Sora registration and monitoring on to Sosa. So, I'm sort of wondering.  Again, this kind of gets back to why, you know, why does this have to, why, why couldn't a guilty plea and adjudication of guilt be the triggering event.  that creates the obligation. Maybe the obligation is unenforceable unless and until somebody has been notified of it for due process purposes, but I'm just trying to kind of sort through the, you know, there are a lot of odd provisions in the statute.",

Again, where everything is in a circumstance like presented here.  all of those obligations don't kick in until, I mean, it just gets us back to the primary question of what a conviction is under this statute, which I think clearly means a complete resolvement of the case, including sentencing. Another clue, I think, to that is looking at the registration period 4002A.  Again, it says that the 10 year period starts at the point the offenders placed on probation, parole, supervised release, et cetera. So under the government's theory, when someone entered a plea of guilty to a sex offense, they would be required to comply with SORA, but the actual period of 10 years wouldn't kick in until they're actually put on probation. I think that's rather nonsensical. And again, shows that when the,  court used the word conviction, it meant what conviction often means in the law, the final disposition of the case, including the sentence. Council, assume that we were to agree with you that conviction means imposition of sentence on judgment under this provision, though it doesn't always mean that, but let's say we agreed with you that was the better reading of these provisions taken as a whole.",

    "text": "Correct. Can I ask you, you seem to be making two slightly different points. I want to make sure I understand each of them. One of them is about  differences in terminology between, for example, B1, committed a registration offense, and B3 and B4, has been subject on two or more occasions to a disposition or has been subject to two or more dispositions. So I get the idea that possibly you can interpret that language differently, and you could interpret one to permit consideration. Although there's past tense in one, you could consider the adjudication and sentence that has just been imposed.  for B1, but not for B3 and B4, because the language is different. So that's at least possible. So I get that line of thought. There is a separate point you seem to be making, which is, leaving that aside, it's just not right to think of the criminal sentencing and the SORA registration as distinct. You can't dissect them. You can't make one of them first and then treat the other one second.  And I have, I guess, two questions about that second point. One of them is, or one of them is an observation, which I've sort of hinted at already, which is, if that second point is right, then I don't quite understand why you concede B-1, because if you can't pull them apart, then you can't get to any past tense in B-1 either. So I'm still puzzled by that. But my other question is, what is it in the statute?  or really in anything else, in law, anywhere, what is your kind of doctrinal support for the idea that it's just wrong to look at the criminal sentencing otherwise as something that can be separate enough from and completed before SOAR registration? What is it that tells you those are inextricably entangled?",

And as happened in this case, if you look at her special conditions of probation, she required him to register as a Class B sex offender.  So both under the statute and then practically, you can't tease that out. The judge wouldn't know, couldn't order someone to be a class B or a class A sex offender without simultaneously resolving which class  of offender, the defendant before him.

You'd think that if that's how it works, that you get sort of two opportunities before the third time when you get lifetime registration, that you would have some provision that explains, oh, well, if you commit a second registration offense while you're on a 10-year registration term,  we will stagger and just, it'll start at the time of sentencing and just extend a little bit beyond or the two tenure periods run consecutive to each other, but there's nothing in there, right? The statute just says there's a tenure registration term and then there's a lifetime registration term. And that seems like a conspicuous omission if your argument is correct.",

I don't see anywhere in the statute that answers the question of whether it could be consecutive or concurrent. And the court obviously doesn't need to resolve that for its decision in this case.

The reason I would submit that the statute doesn't address two 10-year offenses, 10-year registration requirements, is because that's not what's intended. And that's not how the statute was written. The second offense is a lifetime registration requirement. And the fact that there's no such thing as two 10 years run consecutive  there is no second tenure registration offense. There's a second tenure.",

So the two ways you can get to life offenses out of 10 year, what otherwise would be 10 year offenses, like life registration, recidivist life registration, is if you have two different dates of conviction, whatever you think conviction means. That's one way. Another is even if it's on the same date of conviction, if there are two different victims involved.  But the sort of possibility is that you're getting multiple convictions on the same day relating to a single victim. And I think that's not contemplated.",

So anyway, my point is that the reason you don't see anything addressing those multiple tenure  registration orders is because they can't occur. When it's the second one, it becomes life. I thought that Judge Easterly's focus, focusing us on 224003D is very helpful because it reminds us that you can be, there are two ways that you can be ordered to register. One is generally applies when you don't have a case right before the court.  You have convictions in another jurisdiction, or you have a federal case, and you've now been released from prison. You're now subject to registration. CSOSA decides that. There's a provision in the statute to allow the offender to challenge that CSOSA's decision about 10 years versus lifetime if he or she thinks that's appropriate. And I think when you're talking about in 22-4003,  There is either that way that CSOSA does it for a case that's not before the court, or there's what's referred to in subsection D. The court is required to enter an order certifying that a person is a sex offender only when, one, the defendant is found in a proceeding before the court to have committed a registration offense. To me, to us, that clearly indicates that the case at bar  is the case that triggers the registration. And that to me is quite clear from subsection D1 of 22-4003. Finally. Can I ask a question that takes us a little bit off topic, but is sort of related to the jurisdictional question?",

CSOS is not involved at this point because this is an outgrowth of a conviction of a case that we prosecuted. So I think that's the reason why we're here. That's my best understanding. I mean, CSOS is not involved at this point when you have a case that's the case at bar that triggers the registration.  But that's why 4003D directs the court in this case, obligates the court, it's mandatory, it is not discretionary to enter these orders at this point. I guess finally, my last point is I just, to the extent the terms are seen as ambiguous, I think it's important to remember that, and I think there's not been a real  challenge or concern about this being a civil regulatory matter separate from sentencing, any ambiguity should be liberally construed for the benefit of the class that the law was intended to protect. And here, of course, that's the public. It's particularly vulnerable minor victims of these offenders.  And there is just, it is not applying that lens. It's important that the recidivists here be treated the way that the council intended and that the protection of the community by means of lifetime registration not be made to await a third assault on a vulnerable victim. And for that reason, we would urge the court  order the trial court to reconsider its certification of appellee sex offender status and order registration for life.",
