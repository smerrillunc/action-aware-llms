    "text": "Good morning. Matthew Colbert on behalf of the United States. I would like to reserve three minutes for rebuttal.  As Mr. Pope rightly concedes, the motion court erred by suppressing the gun as fruit of an unlawful stop. That concession is appropriate, because it's undisputed that Mr. Pope discarded the gun in the laundry room of the basement before he was stopped by the police. Therefore, under Hodari D., and this court's decisions in Allison and Henson, the gun simply wasn't a product or fruit of the stop.  And so where that leaves us is the question of whether Mr. Pope abandoned a Fourth Amendment interest in his book bag when he discarded it in the laundry room. The answer to that question is yes. And it flows first and primarily from the fact that Mr. Pope was fleeing from police officers, a circumstance that a myriad of cases from around the country, including from this court, recognize as a crucial factor in any abandonment inquiry.  It's also a circumstance that Mr. Pope fails to give any recognition or consideration to in his argument, and his failure to do so we think reveals the weakness of his position. But to be sure, the fact that Mr. Pope lacked a Fourth Amendment interest in the House to begin with is a premise or an assumption that we're proceeding from in our abandonment argument. Mr. Pope- Do you think the record",

And that remainder of the week, he lived either with his grandmother or his mother somewhere else.  That stands in sharp contrast to what he told the officers on scene, which is, I don't live here. I don't have a room here. And when asked for his address. He also gave an explanation, right, as to why he said what he said at the time.",

And I mean, it's the law that this court has been following from the 70s. And I think even, I mean, I do think the reason for it is because there is such a strong privacy interest in somebody's personal belongings that the government has to show by a heightened standard that they have indeed relinquished that. Because of course, this is something that is,  the judge has to find based on all the circumstances, you know, a person isn't going to say, in most cases, I'm relinquishing my privacy interests. So the government needs to be held to a higher standard. But in any event, we think that even under a preponderance standard, they didn't show it here, even if that were the standard. Because as  Judge Ruiz has pointed out, and the government does not concede, that the trial court found that he hid the backpack. And I want to address the two points that the government seems has been saying that even though he did intend to secrete the backpack, he still abandoned it because  he couldn't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in it any longer. One, because he was unlawfully present in the home, and two, because he had fled from police. And both of those are wrong, including for many of the reasons your honors have already stated this morning. There's no support in the record whatsoever for the idea that Mr. Pope was unlawfully present in that home. Not only was there his own testimony about the fact that he  stayed there three nights a week that he's kept his belongings there, but he, there was testimony that was, there was evidence that was not even from him necessarily. Aunt Sheila corroborated on the body worn camera footage his testimony that they were close family and friends. She said he is,  He's a friend. He calls me Aunt Sheila, even though we're not related. And as defense counsel said, that suggested a certain level of intimacy. She said, he comes here. He'd be around here with my son.

In Boswell, the court said that Boswell had concealed his TV from view under the blanket in a publicly accessible hallway, and he did not, quote, discard it in a public area. Mr. Pope did not discard his belongings in a public area. He did not throw them away or leave them behind.  He hid them, and he was right there. And he could expect reasonably, just as Biles could, that his items would remain private there. I know we're all at this point, but did the court in Biles and Butler, did they actually talk specifically about the objective reasonableness prong of the test, as you put it forth? Yeah. In Biles, the court said,  You know, after talking about the fact that he protected his items from sight, et cetera, and he stayed nearby, the court said, while the events took place in a public market, his expectation manifest in his actions was that the items would remain private. And then the court says, this expectation was not defeated merely because Mr. Biles stood in a public market.

So I'm having a little trouble following your reasoning here because if we posit that the book bag was abandoned, I mean, supposing that hypothetical the gun had been in a bag and hidden under a bush,  If we posit that the book bag was abandoned, then I don't understand why the contents of the book bag could be said to retain any, or why he could be said to retain any reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the book bag. Now, I understand there's a dispute about whether the book bag was abandoned, and we'll undoubtedly come back to that. But if we posit that he abandoned the book bag by  placing it someplace in a home in which he had no right to be, then I don't understand why the fact that the gun was inside the book bag gives it adequate protection from seizure.",

    "text": "Well, OK, there's a few questions in there. So let me try to answer them all.  In terms of whether the record could support, whether there needs to be a remand, we would say no, because there's absolutely no evidence that the government put forth that's in the record that would support an idea that he was trespassing or that he was unlawfully present.  The evidence in the trial court was just the opposite. The evidence was that this was his Aunt Sheila. They were family friends that she said that he comes here, he'd be around here with my son. When the police asked him what they should do with the rest of his belongings that were in his backpack, he said, give them to Aunt Sheila. That was undisputed.  He gave an explanation for why he did not tell the police right away that he slept at Aunt Sheila's three nights a week, because he didn't want to disturb her Section 8 housing. And the statements on the body-worn camera footage that the government keeps talking about, there's nothing in there that suggests that he came in against the will of the owner.  Aunt Sheila says on there that he's a friend. He calls me Aunt Sheila, he comes here, he'd be around here with my son. She does say he ain't been here in a minute, but that doesn't show, she doesn't say anything about him not being allowed to come there. And Rob does say, I told him not to come around here no more, but as Judge Deal pointed out, he says, I should have kept it like that, showing that he lifted that restriction. And there's no evidence that when Mr. Pope went into the house,  that Aunt Sheila told him to leave or that she didn't allow him to come in the house or that she stopped him from going into the basement. She didn't tell the police when they came to the door that this guy is not allowed to be in my house and he just came in. There's no evidence that he's not allowed to be there at all. And as I believe maybe Judge Ruiz pointed out,  He testified, and there was no evidence to the contrary, that after he was arrested, he continued to live with Aunt Sheila, and that at the time of the suppression hearing, he lived in a different house with Aunt Sheila. So that's the totality of the record. There's absolutely no reason to remand for a finding on trespass here, because there's just no evidence to support it. And to answer your question about if there were evidence, hypothetically, that he was trespassing, or if there were a finding,  We believe that that would be a closer case. But again, the government has not cited any law to suggest that you completely relinquish your expectation of privacy in, you know, a personal closed container that you have with you. I mean, the police could certainly seize that container when they find you burglarizing the house. If it's on you,  And you know they can probably search it incident to arrest when they arrest you or if they're worried about security and or that you have a gun on you, they could they could look but um we believe that.  They would need a warrant to go into the bag after they seized it but but again that's not that's so far afield from this case and I want the court to remember that there's no evidence of trespass whatsoever here. And as for even as for standing I want to correct some of what the government was saying the government cited.  is arguing that the trial court did make a finding that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the house. And that is just not the case if you go through this record. The court did make some preliminary comments during the colloquy that the court did not believe there was standing. But those were made at a time when the judge acknowledged openly and repeatedly that he had not gone back and reviewed the evidence, including the body-worn camera, which is where  The parties were arguing about what the and Sheila and Rob statements meant in terms of Mr Pope's connection to the house, the judge says several times in on page 55.  57, I don't have it word for word, but we can review it. At page 57, we can listen to it. When defense counsel says, well, Anshila never said that he wasn't allowed in the house, the trial court says, right, sure, I'll definitely go back and listen to that. Again, at 93, OK, I'll go back and listen to that. Then right after that is when the court makes these comments, these preliminary comments. He still has not reviewed that, OK? And then defense counsel pushes back and says, no, no, no, you've got wrong what happens on that body-worn camera footage.  And then the court requests to hear the footage. It's played three times. The court asks for it twice. The court says, let's hear that tape again real quick, because I didn't have a chance to hear it again, and we're going over the same issues. Let me hear that tape. And then they watch the tape. And after the tape's played, the judge revisits the question of Mr. Pope's connection to the home. And the parties talk about what these statements mean  on the body-worn camera footage. Then the court, before ruling, in his oral ruling, starts out by saying, okay, I've spent a lot of time listening to the motions hearing and reviewing the body-worn camera and various tapes. This is at Appendix 12.  It got more it got quote more and more complicated, the more I delved into it, but there's no need to get into all the issues that's an appendix 13, and then he goes on to say he's going to summarize his ruling it doesn't include anything about standing or reasonable expectation of privacy in the house. And of course we know in his written ruling also he does not.  address it and to the contrary he says in a footnote that there was conflicting evidence on whether and Sheila gave permission to come into police to come into the house whether there was consent to the entry.  And he says, but because the stop was unlawful, any issues related to consent are irrelevant. Not because there was no, not because he has no standing to challenge the entry or the search, but because I'm only ruling about the stop. So there is all of the citations that the government has given you about, you know, he didn't have the evidence shows he didn't have a right to be there. He wasn't welcome there, etc. All of those occur before the judge  has watched the tape twice, I'm sorry, three times with counsel and has then made these very equivocal comments about it afterwards. So there just is no finding here that there was not a reasonable expectation of privacy in the house, but we don't think that matters under Boswell and Biles and Shreves.  In all of those cases, the person did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the surrounding location where they hid their belongings. And in all three, the court found that the belongings were not abandoned. And I want to briefly address the government's argument about flight. One, as Judge Deal pointed out, this is not a case of someone discarding mid-flight. I mean, discarding mid-flight would be if Mr. Pope had, during the run,  on the street, thrown away or discarded his his backpack just in the street right in front of the police. Okay, that's what happened in Allison. That's what happened in Smith. That's what happened in all the case the government sites that what was dispositive was not that the person was fleeing even it was that  the items were discarded and thrown away and exposed to public view. The court says in Smith, which the government just provided to the court yesterday, that Smith took the, as he was running away, he took the gun out of his pocket. Okay. So he took it out of a place where it was concealed. He quote, it was, they saw him quote, throw it away on the street while he was fleeing. It was in a left by him in a public place where any passerby  could take it and pick it up. In Allison, same thing. Allison had a gun concealed in his waistband. He took it out of that concealed place and he, quote, threw it away outside on the sidewalk in a bush. So those cases and all of this court's cases on abandonment really turn on whether the person has relinquished his privacy interest by exposing the item  to public view, public access, versus has he hidden it and taken pains to secrete it as in Boswell, Biles, and Shreves, so that it would remain private and others wouldn't see what was in there. And that's what  Mr. Pope did here under the trial court's finding, under the case law, and under the facts that are in the record, the government simply did not prove that he discarded or left behind or otherwise relinquished his interest. He did the opposite of discarding and throwing away. He hid his belongings in a place where he took refuge from a flight. He ended his flight in this house where he believed he was taking refuge with his aunt Sheila,  He hid his belongings so that the police couldn't find them. And presumably, so even so it would be hard for anyone in the house to find them. And he remained nearby. He didn't continue to flee. And he made sure that his item, just like Biles did, he tried to make sure that his items would remain private. And therefore the government did not show that he abandoned his reasonable expectation of privacy. So we would ask that,  the court affirm and there is no reason to remand unless this court disagrees with us and determines that the backpack was abandoned. In that case, there should be a remand because Mr. Pope still has open to him the other arguments he was making in the trial court.  about the police unlawfully entering and searching the home and the issue of consent because those were not resolved and the trial court made no factual findings that would relate to standing and that would allow this court to review, even if there had been a ruling on standing, which we say there wasn't, there would have to be a remand. But again, that's only if you disagree with us.  and find that the backpack was abandoned. And we just don't think that the government proved that here by clear, decisive and unequivocal or any level of evidence. Thank you. Okay.",

    "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. I want to start, I think, where we sort of left off at the end of Apley's argument with this idea that even if Mr. Pope was unlawfully present in the home, that doesn't dispositively deal with the abandonment question Judge Glickman responding to your colloquy with counsel. We think it most certainly does. And we would point the court in the direction of State v. Walker, Louisiana Supreme Court case that we cite in our brief.  as well as Cooper versus state, which is from the Supreme Court of Mississippi in 2014. In both of those situations, suspects fled from police officers or while police officers were present in the case of Walker.  into a home where, in the case of Walker, the woman who was standing at the front of the house told the suspect that he was not allowed to be in the home. The suspect goes into the house, goes into the laundry room, and hides contraband behind the washing machine. And in that case, the Louisiana Supreme Court found that that contraband had been abandoned, putting aside the question that he couldn't have raised the challenge to  The officers entry into the home precisely because he wasn't allowed to be there. Same thing in Cooper versus state a suspect fleas into a rundown home that he didn't live in that he admitted he didn't live in. He found a hole in the drywall and he dropped contraband down a hole in the drywall and in both of those cases.  What the courts find is that the fact that the the suspect was not allowed to be in that home at the time of the search and thus had no Fourth Amendment standing was, along with the presence of police officers and flight from police officers dispositive of an abandonment.  So we think it's quite significant if this court were one to either find that the trial court did rule on this question, that Mr. Polk was unlawfully present, or as I suspect, based on our arguments today, that the court might be headed in this direction, that we need a remand on that factual question. And because those facts are dispositive, we think of the abandonment question, we certainly don't disagree with the idea that a remand would be appropriate in that situation.  In Walker and Cooper, where was the suspect at the time of the police discovery of the hidden items? Both of them were in the house, I believe. They were outside the house when the series of events started, but by the time that the contraband was discovered, they were inside the house.",

Though I think here, and you can see this when you look on the body-worn camera footage,  Mr. Pope isn't in the laundry room. I mean, the laundry room is, you could see where it is. It's guarded by a door. I think the door is open, but the lights are off. And it's a good, I would guess, 10 or 12 feet from where he's sitting on the couch when he appears on the body worn camera.

And the Sixth Circuit, for what it's worth, I think, applies a very similar standard, if not identical standard, to what this court does, where it says that the question is primarily what of intent, but we have to look objectively at the circumstances surrounding that intent. And in that case, the officers were executing a search warrant.  at a residence, and the suspect, defendant Dillard, exited from the side of the house. He saw police officers, and he tossed a briefcase. I believe the court found that it was about four to five feet from him.  at the time he tossed it. And the court recognized that that sort of case fell into a middle ground. And I'll quote from that decision here. The court said, Dillard threw the briefcase to the ground near the side door of a house he had been visiting. The location was not as open as a public street or a parking lot, but neither was it entirely private.  And so I think that's probably the best authority I have for the idea.

No, I think he testified to the fact that he told Sheila not to let them in. Right. But when you'd see his actions, his actions are, he's not only trying to hide the gun, he's hiding himself, right?  or trying to hide himself. He's spoiled in there, in that. But in terms of looking at how people act and what is kind of the reasonable expectation, how we should interpret his actions, it doesn't look to me at all like either the Judge Glickman's  hypothetical about, you know, this yard that belongs to some stranger or somebody who's in, you know, like Hodari D, the headlong flight and throwing things in bushes and you continue to run away, not only from the police, but from the object you're trying to get as far away from you as possible.

So I agree on its face, it feels different when someone runs into a house.

It's does the person challenging the search, does Mr. Pope have that expectation of privacy? Certainly Aunt Sheila or Rob, assuming he lives at the house, would have an expectation of privacy there. It's their home. But there's no authority for the proposition that you can flee into a house that you have no lawful right to be in and maintain an expectation of privacy  in a cupboard or underneath a bed or anywhere else that's beyond your person.

    "text": "We're ready now. Yes. Oh, okay. Great. Good morning. Uh, I first want to thank you all for hearing my appeal, um, over anything else. This appeal is simply about justice and reconnecting a family.  It's clear that the court erred in awarding the appellee primary custody of the five minor children over the appellant. The court relied on the appellee's false accusations, which have proven to be fabricated. During the initial trial stage, the appellee raised non-debunked accusations of domestic violence, child sexual assault, financial manipulation, and other claims of violence against the appellant.  I'm sure the appellant's attorney will come before you today touting many events that they would like for you to consider as fact, and they will want to try to convince you to act on emotion and storytelling. However, their stories will not be based on any evidence. I'd also like to remind the court that these issues between the parties went before three judges, Judge Ryan, Judge McKay, and Judge Becker. All three judges had issues with the appellee's version of events and her honesty in general.  no judge ever questioned the appellant's honesty. Judge Ryan in his final remarks stated his surprise at the appellee's quote significant history of use of violence and admitted dishonesty. Stating further that quote she admitted to a number of circumstances of hitting him and taking full responsibility for hitting him first every time as she put it.  Judge McCabe, after hearing the myriad of accusations thrown by the appellee, was frustrated by these false attempts and stated, quote, domestic violence is not going to affect the ruling in this case. But that did not stop the appellee from trying to add more cases of domestic violence when the calendar changed to Judge Becker, adding new unheard instances that had not been mentioned in the nearly year and a half of trials. Even Judge Becker in her final ruling stated,  Quote, the court has difficulty crediting Ms. Johnson's version of these events. So to be clear, there's an ongoing credibility issue for the appellee and her team with raising false allegations of violence in court to gain favor in her case. There was a great effort by the appellee to paint the appellant as an abusive and controlling dominator.  but there were no facts to back up this claim. There was no eyewitness testimony, no aggressive email or text message, no police report, no witness outside of the appellee's allegations, only hearsay and debunked stories.  In fact, the evidence on the record shows that the appellee herself has always been the primary aggressor by her admissions as as between you and happily perhaps, but there were witnesses who testified about an instant with an instance with Kendall.",

And I believe it is surprising that with all the evidence and admissions of inter-family violence by the appellee, that there's no mention or consideration of it in the final custody determination by the court.  but rather only allegations and hearsay against the appellant are mentioned in the final order. Ignoring the appellee's abuse and irresponsibility is not in the best interest of the children. In her final ruling, Judge Becker states that, quote, Ms. Johnson is deeply committed to parenting the children at all times, and she worked to maintain normalcy. I asked the court to consider what of these acts should be considered normal.  The record shows that the appellee admitted on the record to drug abuse while being caretaker for the children. She admitted to growing marijuana in the house among the children. She admitted to taking child Isaac along with her to purchase drugs. She admitted to multiple infidelities. She misled the court with stories of child sexual abuse and being the victim of domestic violence. She admitted to violent behavior and being the primary instigator of violence in the home.  She admitted to being verbally abusive. She was ordered by Judge McCabe to take an anger management class, but which never happened. She admitted to being often absent from the home. She admitted to moving out for months to be with her paramour, leaving all the children in the care of the appellant. She destroyed and vandalized the home and had the children living in rat infested conditions after the separation.  After all of these admissions that were backed by evidence and her admission, I don't see where the judge sees normalcy. This behavior, even to a non-professional, can only be described as toxic in a marital or family setting. I reiterate that this is admissions on the record. How does a person that commits this number of offenses in a marriage not be found at fault in a divorce? I believe that the judge really missed an opportunity for justice and failed my children.  No psychologist or doctor has ever cited the appellant as a threat or a substandard parent. No CPS investigator has ever found the appellant's home or his relationship with his children to be substandard. The appellant also voluntarily took and passed two separate parenting classes provided by the DC Superior Court.  Appellant has never left the home or his children while they were in his care. Further, the appellant is a law-abiding citizen never convicted of any crime and has been tested by the court and found to be drug and alcohol free. And he should not be kept from his children. And he's followed every court order to date, even if unjust. I'm appealing this decision of the lower court in order to right this wrong in the best interest of my children.",

    "text": "At this time, when Kendall made that statement, there was some manipulation going on between Miss Johnson and my daughter.  If you look on the record, the incident that you brought up earlier about Kendall falling into a wall, or when I pulled her out of the car, she hit the wall, that incident happened in 2012.  Myself and Kendall had reconciled, went on vacations. I went to her school field trips, been to her cheerleading, her sports events, all of that. So it really puzzled me that they went back so far to find this incident in 2012 to try to make a case in this divorce.  So this this issue between me and Kendall is really broadly more broadly manipulation, even in her ruling, the judge said that the reconnection is necessary, and that she ordered for Kendall to actually have counseling.  because she believed that Kendall was acting inappropriate or this situation was inappropriate. And now two years afterwards, or I think it's been about two years, that counseling still hasn't happened. So if I could continue, I wanna talk about the division of property.  Please do. OK, great. The second subject I'd like to cover is the error in the judge's distribution of property. The appellee in this trial took many case law opinions and used them as examples. However, please do not suffer from their manipulation of excerpts. Please take the context of each case they cite and see how it lines up with DC law in this case.  As a reminder to the court, which I know you know, but I'm going to read it anyway. Upon entry of a final decree of legal separation, annulment or divorce, or upon the termination of a domestic partnership in the absence of a valid anti-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement resolving all issues related to the property of the party, the court shall  assigned to each party his or her sole and separate property acquired prior to the marriage or domestic partnership, and his or her sole and separate property acquired during the marriage or domestic partnership by gift, bequest, devise, or descent, and any increase thereof. So noting assigned to each party his or her sole and separate property acquired before the marriage.  There's nothing speculative or interpretive about this rule. The only variable in this entire rule is the word upon entry. The only thing this rule is asking for is the insertion of a date. In past cases, the court has been consistent and ruled justly. The parties in this case married April 23, 2005.  No other date, but that date. The appellant purchased his home in 2001, almost four years prior to the marriage, where the parties didn't even know each other and had no affiliation. The most similar case I could find was Bryce versus Bryce in 1980, where the principal focus of the dispute in the case was real property, the home where they lived with their children.  The only difference between that case and my case is Mr. Bryce purchased the home only two months prior to the marriage versus I, you know, purchased mine four years before the marriage.  Mr. Bryce introduced the deed and other evidence to show that he had acquired legal title to the house. He retained the title. He made all the financial contributions to the house, the down payment, all settlement charges, mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, and improvements. The appellant in this case did the exact same thing. The trial court found that the title and fee had always been exclusive in the name of Thomas H. Bryce.  and awarded and granted the full title and fee exclusively, solely, and alone to Mr. Bryce. The only thing the appellant is asking is for the same legal right. This is what the law states to do, and the judge in this case inserted a date and followed the law. Did not take into account any extraneous things, he just simply followed the law.  Now in a more recent example, Bonsada versus Wheeler, this one was way more convoluted, because they were actually registered domestic partners, they live together, they shared expenses, they were engaged, they actually shopped for the house together. They bought and began living together on Rittenhouse Street in Northwest.  But in this case, Wheeler, the title holder, nefariously persuaded his soon-to-be wife not to put her name on the title. She understood that she was going to be co-owner of the house. Wheeler made the down payment on the home, made all the mortgage payments, and was the only person whose name was on the title. Even though he hedged his wife out of this investment, the court concluded that Rittenhouse  the Rittenhouse house acquired by Wheeler only a month before the marriage was premarital and the property was not subject to equitable division. And citing Yeldell versus Yeldell and Hemley versus Hemley, the court was required to find that the non-titled spouse had a legal or equitable interest in the property. In this current matter before the court,  The appellee showed no evidence of any payments made toward the mortgage, no tax returns, no utility payments, no evidence of her being on the title, and no evidence in the upkeep or repairs of the home.

They put the date in, the date was before the marriage or after the marriage, so she got a part. The home that I bought- Let me ask you, if I may interrupt you for a moment, let me ask you a related question.",

And at the end of the trial, the vehicle was  found abandoned and destroyed in a glass in a grass field. And I never received any compensation was never realized in the final order and there was no nothing about also the corporate debt of the family I never, you know, never realized anything for that.  And also, just to be clear, like, I really want to harp on the fact of this whole date situation. In all of my research, I've yet to see a case where the date on a marriage certificate was voided or even changed by something set in court. As strict as all the judges were by abiding by dates and respecting contracts and respecting the law,  The fact that this judge did not take the actual marriage date into consideration for his determination is groundbreaking and incomprehensible. Because the appellee asked the court to take the property's value from 2004, a year before the marriage, the court decided to overrule the law and comply. A false narrative should not be able to suit the law.",

Now, generally, I agree with you, the law reigns supreme, but generally speaking, if you see a legal error in court, you have to speak up. And if you don't,  don't get to complain about it later.

    "text": "Good morning and may it please the court. Callie Cope Caston on behalf of Appalachian I. Johnson.  The order that the appellant is challenging here today is the product of a six-day trial at which both parties were represented by counsel and at which 14 witnesses testified. The judge presiding over that trial paid careful attention, and she issued a decision that was thoughtful and supported by the evidence that was presented at trial. We are here today not because that judge abused her discretion, but because the appellant simply did not like the decision the trial court reached.  That is not a basis for this court to disturb the final order and judgment below. Starting with the division of property, there's no serious question here that Ms. Johnson is entitled to at least some equitable interest in the house. The trial court properly determined that 55 Quincy Place Northwest was the sole and separate property of the appellant because he had purchased it prior to the marriage. And therefore, Ms. Johnson has no ownership interest in the house. We agree with that.  But as this court has made clear in numerous instances, most notably perhaps in Yeldell, it's squarely within the discretion of the trial court to award an equitable interest in the home. And that's what the court did here. It properly assigned Ms. Johnson a 40% equitable interest in the home based both on her financial contributions during the marriage and her contributions in the form of full-time childcare for the party's five children and full-time care of the household.  Now, Judge Deal asked a question earlier about Ms. Johnson's contributions going to the joint account of the parties. The testimony that was presented at trial showed that Ms. Johnson, in fact, when she was working, which was for close to five years of the marriage, or roughly 45% of the time that these parties were married, that her money went into a joint account out of which both the bills for the home were paid and which the mortgage was paid out of.  That's testimony that's from May 28 at transcript page 121, lines 6 through 8, which is at page 302 of our appendix. And also at page 979 of our appendix, you will find trial transcript testimony from June 13, page 133, lines 1 through 14.  There's no question that Ms. Johnson absolutely made both financial contributions at various points during the marriage and that she made significant contributions as a homemaker, which the trial court appropriately took into account. And I want to pick up where we left off with Mr. Macklin.",

Opposing counsel, who was representing Mr. Macklin at the time, had full notice that that was the only number that Ms. Walsh was talking about. He knew that on cross-examination, he could have asked Ms. Walsh questions about what that difference would have been if we were looking at 2005.  Because Ms. Walsh was one of the first witnesses to testify at trial, he had plenty of notice that he could have brought at any point in the remaining days of the trial his own witness to talk about a different number that that would have been or what that value would have been. And certainly, at minimum, he could have, in closing arguments, said that he thought that it was error for the appellee to ask for the calculation to be from 2004 or for Ms. Walsh to have presented the evidence from 2004. None of that ever happened.  Instead, what happened was that the trial court was presented with one number, which was 2004, and Ms. Walsh testified at trial that the value in 2004 was minimally different than the value in 2001 or 2002, which she was looking at as the starting point for the purchase of the home. So that's the only evidence that's before the trial court, and the trial court used those numbers to reach her calculation without any alternative.  there's no abuse of discretion by the trial court to use the evidence that was presented. Additionally, this is not a question of if Ms. Johnson is entitled to some interest in the House, the question is exactly where to draw the line. The appellant conceded that Ms. Johnson was entitled to up to 20% of the equity in the value of the home,  That's what he argued through his counsel at trial. We asked for 50 percent. They asked for up to 20 or conceded up to 20. And the trial court judge granted 30.",

Although he then says somewhere between zero and 20, I don't think that it does keep alive the idea that there would have been zero. He conceded that there was equitable interest in the value of the home on behalf of Ms. Johnson. That's at page 1333 of our appendix.  What this court was doing was balancing the many factors that were presented to the court in terms of the financial contributions that both parties were making. She didn't suggest that Ms. Johnson was making disproportionately high payments. She took into account the homemaker contributions of both parties. And where she came out was below what the appellee was asking for at trial. She came out with a 40% calculation. Even if this court would find that  looking at the evidence anew, they think that it would be a different number than the 40%. There's no question about an abuse of discretion here.

We'll just take 10% off the top at the end of the calculation, which is, I think you might agree, not quite the way you should do it. It's not quite legally correct because  it seems to me you first have to start with the baseline. What is, what is the big chunk that we're dealing with? And from that, you should take away whatever equity he had put into the house before the marriage. And then you should decide, does she get 50% or 40% or something less to kind of lump it all in together with a kind of a crude, I'll just drop it down 10% because maybe that's roughly gonna even out versus what he put in before the marriage.

In this case, the judge used 2004 for that data point because that was the only evidence that was presented.

The suggestion that she should have somehow tried to figure it out on the front end when she had no evidence to do that is putting a burden on her that the judge doesn't bear.

What I'm saying is the only evidence that the trial judge had to rely on to determine what the value of that would be.  suggested that there was minimal difference. And so she was in finding the value of the home at 2004 to be roughly what it was in 2002.

For the trial court judge to then say, I think that Mr. Macklin should in fact receive credit for that to some degree.

What he's reading from is a demonstrative that was presented to the court. It was in fact not evidence. It was never admitted as an exhibited trial. It was not part of the record that was ultimately before the court. Or that is before this court. Now what was presented to the court were the numbers that  Ms. Walsh was using for her calculation, looking at the 2004 value. Ms. Walsh did agree that at some point in 2005, if you read her testimony, she said at some point in 2005, there was an increase in value due to a housing bubble. There are recessions and booms throughout the time of the marriage, certainly. But what we're trying to do is use 2004 or  2005 as this approximation for the point where the value began accruing for the purposes of Ms. Johnson's equitable contributions to the home. It's not like Ms. Johnson got a year more credit by using 2004 versus 2005. The only evidence that the court had is not what Mr. Macklin read. It is that the value of the home in 2004 was $227,000.",

    "text": " That's part of the answer, Your Honor. Part of the answer is also to the extent that he's arguing that he should be given credit when the purchase price of the home was $225,000 and the value of the mortgage or the value of the home when we're looking at this is $227,000. I'm not sure where he should have argued that he should have been given credit for a lot of that time. The court appropriately used the value at the time Ms. Johnson's equitable contributions began  accruing. This isn't a calculation of each year, each person gets a certain amount of equity in a home and therefore  They should be given credit for that time period. He was given credit by the fact that 2004 was the value that was used when calculating the home. The difference between 2001 and 2004, if it was material, he should have presented evidence on because the court was using the 2004 value, but she didn't find that Ms. Johnson was entitled to any part of what Mr. Macklin used in terms of his contributions between the 2001 and 2002 time period.  I'm certainly happy to answer any other questions the court has. Otherwise, I know that I'm out of time, and so I will return to Mr. Macklin.",

    "text": "I do, Your Honor. With respect to the custody, the trial court judge did  The Trump court judge did exactly what she was asked to do by the DC code, which is to conduct an assessment of the 17 best interest factors. And she did. So with the exception of the factor, considering a disruption in the children's school and social life which neither party presented evidence on a trial or suggested actually applies in this case.  The court's findings, then, by drawing on extensive testimony from the witnesses, including from the three children, and I want to speak to the question about what the children's preferences were stated when the judge interviewed them, because there was, in fact, evidence that all three of the children testified that they were comfortable with generally the arrangement that they had or something less than that, with the exception of Avery suggesting he wanted one more day.  The testimony that the children gave, which was on Wednesday, June 6 2018 at page 192 of the trial transcript from that day. Kindle testifies about the fact that she didn't want to have any time with Mr Mack on page 203 every testified that he thought maybe giving his dad one more day would be fair, but he generally thought the arrangement or the balance between the parties was a good one.  At page 237 through 238 Ryan testified, I want to leave it the same speaking about the custody arrangement, quote, I think it's good how it is. I think it's balanced. Okay. So based on interviewing these children based on the testimony of all of the witnesses, the trial court relied on those findings.  from the 16 of the 17 best interest factors that were relevant to her consideration. And she determined exactly what is the presumption in this jurisdiction, which is that the party should have joint legal and physical custody and that primary physical custody in this case was most appropriate with Miss Johnson.  based on the testimony that the court had heard. There's no indication that she abused her discretion by not considering some of the evidence that Mr. Macklin has cited today that was not part of the record before that court. And again, it's not part of the record before the court today. Thank you, Your Honor.",

    "text": "Okay, so everything that I said today was on the record. So I don't understand the last statement that Ms. Caston just said. Everything that I spoke of, all of the different things that I listed about the drug abuse, about the violence, everything there is on the record and cited. I cited it in my brief. So I don't understand that statement.  However, speaking on the children, and for me, if I put myself in my children's shoes, and I go through, you know, a two year long divorce, which is not a pretty divorce.  You know, it's a lot of moving parts, people having to sell their homes and move here, move there. And, you know, it gets really ugly and it's an uncomfortable thing, more so for the kids, I think, than the adults, because the kids are moving back and forth. However, the custody determination as it is right now was gotten nefarious.  The custody as it is right now is deemed on an arrest that was made in 2016 where I was arrested for domestic violence, which I was acquitted of, which the court acquitted me of.  Since that time, when I was acquitted of those charges, I was supposed to be reintroduced to my family, and we were supposed to, because if you're acquitted, it's like it didn't happen. It's supposed to be, right? So at that time, I'm excited. I'm like, okay, now I get to be back with my family. And then at that time, Ms. Johnson then says, oh, well, now there's sexual abuse.  So then that makes it an even longer thing. I'm waiting months and months again for an investigation to happen. I'm going to quit it again. And now I'm like, OK, now I can be whole with my family. But then Judge McCabe just says, well, let's just leave it like this because of a comfort, because the kids are comfortable now where they are. I think that's an abuse, really, of the system. I feel like if you are going to accuse somebody of something  then it turns out that they didn't do what you accused them of, then there should be some recompense for that. There should be some type of, I don't know, like it should be repaired. You should be able to go back. It should be like you can go back in time.",

    "text": "No, that's not the case because when it was suspended, my reduced visitation was suspended. It's not like I had 50-50 at that time. My reduced visitation was suspended and then I went back to reduced visitation. I never got my 50-50. I understand.  Right. So that's what I'm saying. And as far as the Yeldell versus Yeldell that she brought up earlier, in that case, Ms. Yeldell brought documentation. She diligently showed receipts. She showed, look, I paid this, I paid this, I paid this, I paid this, I paid this.  Okay, there was evidence, there was paperwork, there's a paper trail. So, you know, give me my money or whatever, right? In this case, nothing was shown, no tax returns, no receipts, no text messages saying, oh, I need money for the mortgage or can you pay this next week or nothing like that was submitted because I paid everything.  So for her to cite Yeldell versus Yeldell, that's a totally different thing, in my opinion. I believe that that's a separate thing. And the court put the burden on Ms. Yeldell to provide documentation. Zero documentation was provided in this. Not even a pay stub, I don't think. So that's my argument with that. And another thing that she said,  Oh, the demonstrative that she spoke of the demonstrative that she spoke of that was used in court is how they got their number. They actually use that demonstrative to extrapolate a number on that day, so I don't know why she's discounting the demonstrative as being a worthwhile thing now.  Um, that demonstrative was the only thing submitted to the judge to make a determination. So, and we accepted that demonstrative. So if she wants to call it a demonstrative, she wants us to call it evidence. That's what was used. That's what the judge saw. So, all right, Mr. Macklin, thank you.",
