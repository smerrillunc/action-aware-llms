Although the court is working in deciding cases, we are now having oral arguments remotely. Those arguments are being streamed live on YouTube and they're available thereafter and the links to view them are available on the court's website.  Court staff has been working hard to try to get the judges and counsel ready to conduct remote arguments, but technical problems may arise, and if they do, we ask your patience. We have two arguments on this morning's calendar. I want to mention at the outset that Judge Stedman is refused from the second of the cases, and he's been replaced by Judge Nemecher. So after the first argument is finished, we will take a brief recess, and then Judge Nemecher will replace Judge Stedman.  Turning to the first case, the first case on the calendar is Sergio Velasquez Cardozo v. United States, number 17 CF774. Counsel, you may proceed.",

And I respect, if it's okay with the court, six minutes of rebuttal time. Your Honor, just let me start with the substantive kidnapping issues.  It's undisputed in this case that, under the facts of this case, the government must prove both a seizing and separately and independently a holding and detaining. In our view, these concepts require some dominion and control over the person, over the victim. That did not happen here.  The victim ER's forward motion was briefly impeded. It was stopped, according to the police officer witness, for a quote, split second. According to ER, the contact between the assailant and the victim lasted, quote, moments. And the victim shrugged the assailant off and continued to walk forward. Shrugged is the word of the victim.  We have cited several dictionary definitions, which we think we get to the issues, what does the words seizing and the words holding and detaining mean.  We cited several dictionary definitions, and we've also pointed to the, suggested that the Fourth Amendment, Fourth Amendment case law might be a useful guide to what- Mr. Kaplan, can I ask you about the Fourth Amendment case law analogy?",

That's probably, although there are plenty of times where it doesn't happen that way and there is no notice, it seems to me that at least this common problem is a setting where the complainant is aware that there's imminent sexual conduct.  it would have been capable of declining, or in fact did decline, and the defendant persisted anyway.

In fact, it seems not obvious to me, but I don't, you know, feel free to try to persuade me otherwise, but I would have thought there are, you could read,  hundreds of cases on west law where there not only was the opportunity to decline but there was in fact a declination of participation in sexual contact.",

So if you look at third-degree sexual abuse, one way of committing it, it's option two, is by essentially threatening the victim that if the victim doesn't comply with the sexual contact issue,  some other person will be subjected to death, bodily injury, or kidnapping. So that's one way you can commit third degree sexual abuse.  Fourth degree sexual abuse expressly excludes that as a way you can be found guilty of fourth degree sexual abuse. If you look at subsection one, it says you can violate it by threatening or placing the other person in reasonable fear other than by threatening or placing that person in reasonable fear that any person will be subjected to death, bodily injury, or kidnapping. And so it seems like this is kind of a quirk of how these statutes are written.  That seemed at least one way in which one would have committed third-degree sexual abuse but couldn't have been found guilty of fourth-degree sexual abuse because that's just excluded categorically from fourth-degree sexual abuse. Do you have a reaction or thought on that?",

And what I hear appellant making here today are essentially two arguments as to why there was insufficient evidence of kidnapping. The first is sort of a factual challenge in arguing that somehow this victim was not in fact seized and detained.  And then the second is that even if she was detained, that it somehow wasn't long enough. I think the testimony of both the victim and Officer Stoddard establishes that she was in fact detained. If you look at that testimony, Officer Stoddard  uses the term bear hug. He says that, as he says, at least for a split second that she wasn't able to keep walking forward. The victim also says that in the moment that she was grabbed from behind, she couldn't walk forward. And she did have to use force to break free, whether it was shrugging or using her elbows. In other words, she was, in fact, grabbed, which we'd submit most people would understand to be a seizure, and she was helped.  She was held there until she broke free.",

And I grab a hold of the arm of somebody who's next to me, who I don't know at all. I just grab a hold of them and using them as kind of somebody to balance.

It seems like on your definition of the statute that fits literally and your point is, of course, no one will ever prosecute that, but it is disturbing. I think this is a 30 year offense. It's an incredibly serious offense, and it doesn't really have a culpable mens rea requirement explicit in it. It's not like with a bad purpose.  It's with a hint, you know, intent to hold for ransom or reward or otherwise. So maybe, you know, to use as a balance. And so it's very natural for courts to want to be looking at the words like seize or hold or detain to find limits before a 30-year crime is committed.

And so at sentencing, a judge can distinguish between sort of  kidnappings, which in colloquial terms are thought of as incidental or brief or not very significant in setting the sentence. And to some extent, yes, charging discretion does play a role in deciding whether or not a crime is going to be charged. But that's true for every kind of offense. A lot of statutes are broadly worded and could be read to apply to a number of different situations that we might say, well, that seems benign, it seems  too much but that doesn't mean that the elements of the statute have to be rewritten because it isn't clear that there is a either a sort of practical way to do that nor is it necessarily particularly when the legislature has spoken about how this statute is supposed to be created they get to decide what the elements of the offense are.",

Uh, so it's certainly if the argument is that the detention must last a certain amount of time before there is such a thing as a seizure or a holding or detaining,  resubmit that there is no support, certainly in the statute for that and none in this court's case law. Uh, Judge Steel, as you pointed out earlier in your discussion with Mr Kaplan, this court in Richardson has said that there isn't an exception for kidnappings that are momentary. Uh, and I think that, you know, that is sufficient to answer the question today. Was there a seizure?  Was there a holding or detaining? The answer is yes, because it occurred.

So it is kind of interesting that  So far, at least, the parties have directed us only to a Missouri case under a very different statute, set of provisions from a long time ago. And Mr. Kaplan's point is, if this is the kind of thing that really is taking advantage of the incapable, then why don't we have cases in D.C. about it? Why aren't there other cases around the country about it?  And in fact, there is more law out there that the parties haven't pointed to, and it's not entirely uniform about how to look at all this.

The D.C. statute does not say physically incapable. It just says incapable. Physically incapable, I would  submit could well be read to sort of limit incapability to situations in which the victim is perhaps drugged, intoxicated, asleep.

It's a 30-year felony. I think that needs to be taken into account in interpreting the provisions of the statute.  And it simply seems to me inconceivable that Congress would have intended the type of conduct that the government is now contending is covered by this statute to be deemed a kidnapping offense. And I would specifically direct the court to the Supreme Court's case in Chatwin, where the Supreme Court makes exactly this point that we can't consider  that this is a kidnapping statute. And obviously, the court was dealing with the federal statute. But the court's point was that we're dealing with kidnapping here. This is a very serious offense, and we cannot have trivial conduct be deemed to be a kidnapping, and that Congress could not have intended that.  know, the government sentiment, Judge Deal may have quoted this, but the government says in his brief, the district's kidnapping provision captures all conduct obstructing or forcing the movement of another without their consent. And I don't think the government is retreating from that position. I mean, this is, we cited the example in our brief, someone blocking another person from  leaving the subway car. In the government's interpretation, that would seem to be kidnapping. And our view is that that clearly could not have been what Congress intended. Unless there's any other questions about kidnapping, let me turn just briefly to the  to the incapacity, to the issue of incapacity under a fourth degree sexual abuse. I mean, the statute says that the person, for a conviction, the person must be either A, incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct. And clearly here, there's no allegation the victim knew what had happened the moment she was touched. B, incapable, declining participation in sexual conduct.  She did decline, and she said no immediately when she was touched, and she walked away. And see- Well, Mr. Kaplan, on that point, I think you might not be chopping the issue up with the sufficient temporal granularity.",

And finally, of course, they can set special conditions. So it's actually the regulations themselves on the on 11 X DC Mr 104 the private school plan regulation.  The regulations specifically say, and that's why our argument is that the BZA didn't do its job at actually analyzing its own regulations, that the private school may be located so that it is not likely to become objectionable to adjoining a nearby property because of certain activities and adverse impacts like noise, traffic, number of students, or otherwise objectionable conditions.  The number of staff, for example, between MIC operations in their conference center, their staff and the number of staff at the Levine School was somewhat comparable. There are actually more staff at MIC. So what we're arguing is that simply relying on saying that there's some instruction that takes place opens the door to almost anybody, any residential  at private residents could say that they host events that are of an instructional nature. Certainly all the conference centers and all the hotels in the district could make the same argument and could justify turning a residential zone essentially into a completely different use or justify a different use.",

So these were all kind of measures that the court was able to take to assess whether, and it's not any one of those things that would be definitive as to what on the question of the school, but cumulatively to be able to analyze  That point of law. And, and we would add one additional thing. And, and that is that the employees also brought this out in their brief. They're not even arguing that that MIC would be you would be under the regulations, using the property as an educational use and in fact they distinguished, they said it's not, it's not really important.  whether or not the term educational use applies here because that's not the word school. Well, you know, that would be one useful thing that the BZA could do is look at other sections of the regulations and see how education is treated in analyzing these. Yeah, I'm interested in that answer because you did cite another, I mean, although private school is not a defined term, private education is a defined term.",

    "text": "What's wrong with that?  That's why I was going to start with the quotation from Miss Fox Perry, where she says directly to this point, quote, the other thing too, is that we're being told, look only at the conference center and not at the 111 unit condominium building because the building is by right. The components of this project, however, are inseparable from each other.  You've got the motor court, the parking garage. They're all going to be shared. It is really impossible to separate them, and that the burdens, the impacts from both should be considered. And so that is our point there, that yes, of course, there is a matter of right. But we're not talking about conceivably what the applicant could do in another hypothetical world. We're talking about what they're planning  to do and the actual concerns that neighbors, as represented by their elected official, ANC, voiced. And so that's why, as a matter of right, it doesn't discount the concerns that they have. Because actually, the conference center is a huge portion of this development. As MIC explained itself,  reason for the condominium building is to support its operations. Its operations are of the set of the event planning type or of the event space that we discussed earlier. And so these two facilities are joined. So it is impossible to say what the actual impact would be in some other plan that would allow, you know, lower density residential housing across the entire piece of property, because that's not what's presented before us.  And that may be completely impractical given the fact that there are two national historical landmarks on the property as well.  I just want to say in closing, because we are over time, that we did deal with, and there was some confusion or back and forth, I would say, in the briefs about the issue of the comp plan. And it is not our position that the BZA implements the comp plan. We did not argue that in the brief. Simply we argued that it is actually the ANC's obligation to look at planning documents of the district.  And she, in her job, in her responsibility of analyzing the impacts of this project, looked at the comp plan and identified discrepancies. And the BZA did not deal with those discrepancies. Understanding that it's no expert in the comp plan, it could at least have answered those concerns. And it just did not.  And it's our position that that cannot be great way to simply ignore the impact by alluding to either an MOU or that may or may not actually be enforceable. And there's things that I can raise. We brought them up in the brief about why those MOUs were problematic. For example, one of the parties didn't even exist at the, you know,  For example, the condominium association doesn't exist so we don't know how we would be working with them or implementing that mo you and then finally on the comp plan that we have a right.  as district residents and the neighbors to look to the future of what DC is going to look like and what that neighborhood is going to feel like living there with this additional conference space and with this additional large building that changes the landscape. So it, you know, it is not affording great weight  to simply dismiss concerns, valid concerns, that the ANC presented by alluding to the Zoning Commission's decision. When you go to the Zoning Commission's decision on this point, and it doesn't address the substance of the matter.",

I'd like to address initially our standing argument. As the court knows, we've moved to dismiss the case altogether on the basis of standing and for summary disposition in response to the petitioner's motion for summary reversal.  On the standing point, the analysis that Judge McLeese laid out in the opinion of the DC Library Renaissance case gives a wholesome discussion and analysis of the District of Columbia constitutional law and standing. And I think this case stands quite in stark contrast to the DC Library case, and specifically,  For standing under this court's jurisprudence, there must be constitutional standing, which requires an injury in fact that has to be real, concrete, and particularized. And that injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenge of action. And third, it has to be likely redressed by a favorable decision in this matter. Second, with respect to prudential standing, they can't  Conditioners can't litigate generalized grievances. And there's a very helpful zone of interest analysis in the D.C. library case. I think in this case in particular, though, I'm not challenging the zone of interest per se, but the injury here that's alleged is in stark contrast to that in the D.C. library case.  The petitioners claimed that as a result of the decision they were challenging, their library was going to be closed, and they said the new one was going to be inadequate. It was concrete, the court held, and particularized. The issue is that it's much more analogous to the claimed injury, if you will, in the York Area Tenants Association case, where the court held that there was no standing.  But if I remember that Buda case correctly, it was sort of this very vague, you know, quiet enjoyment of our homes without putting any meat on the bones.",

    "text": " May I just make one point with respect to standing then, understanding and respecting your honor's view on that. I think that the point that I'm trying to make on standing here is that, and it's related to what the Petitioner's Council was talking about at the end of her argument, which is their concern. And if you look at, I'm just reading from the letter, this is, I believe it's at the joint appendix at 405.  a record 405, I apologize. They say the project, which will add more than 110 units of residential housing as a conference center. And I quote, will create an undue burden through the influx of residential and construction related traffic, loss of parking and an inevitable increase in noise and congestion.  And the noise and congestion was akin to what was claimed in York area tenants. But more importantly, the focus was on and the identified impact was the influx of residential and construction related traffic. And the important point here is that those two issues, the residential use is not being challenged, it's a matter of right.  That would not be regressed here. It's not fairly traceable to the challenged action here. It's not traceable to this being a school or not. And second, construction is legally irrelevant under the St. Mary's case. And the BZA addressed that point, particularly at joint appendix 190 in the order. So under this court's decision in the St. Mary's case, you can't look to the impacts of construction because construction is gonna happen at any development.  And my point here on standing is simply that these particular petitioners were citing injuries that they claim would be the natural outgrowth of this residential project and construction related activities is what they were focused on in talking about these particular impacts.  We submit that that's not tied to the challenged action and not likely addressed by a favorable decision. But understanding the court's perspective and interest on the school aspect, I listened with interest, of course, to the arguments of counsel with respect to the school issue.  And it's a little bit ironic, and I would submit procedurally unfair, to say you didn't even flesh this out at the hearing when Judge Steele, as you noted, I was thinking the same thing when that argument was being made, this issue wasn't even raised by anybody until their post-hearing briefs. So it wasn't fleshed out. It wasn't the subject of a lot of  testimony the way it was in the Levine school case.

So I think that's probably, as a practical matter, why you don't see people clamoring to be treated as a school, because then you have to go through the special exception process and make all kinds of showings, which was done here.  But the bottom line with respect to the regulations that are on the books now is that there is no definition of private school. And CTA regulations say where there's no definition, you look to Webster's Dictionary. They may not like the Webster's Dictionary definition, but that's what the regulation says.

So I get that point. But just in terms of, I mean, the BZA concluded that the current record was enough to establish  that this is a school. And so I apologize for interrupting Judge Steele. He was asking a question about faculty, but he had some others that are similar to ones I was thinking of. Like, do you have, you know, do you, is there, are there any payments that are called tuition? Are there any, are the people who come and get educated called students? So there are all those questions. And are they, are the events called classes?  What are they called? If they're called conferences, what does that mean? Those all seem potentially relevant if you're trying to figure out whether it's just a reasonable thing to call a school linguistically or maybe in a regulatory way. So that's, and I don't mean, again, I kind of jumped into the middle of Judge Diehl's question, so I want to make sure he gets back in, but the related- I have the same questions. Yeah, but the other piece of it is that your opponent is making an argument and made an argument in front of the BZA of,  that is along the lines of there has to be some quantitative inquiry too. And so if I call, and this Judge Deal's original hypothetical was about that, if most of what I do is running a McDonald's, but once every two months I train new employees for a half hour and I call it a class, I have someone whose job it is to go around the country who's called, you know, the teacher and I call the people, you know, trainee students.  That feels like it's educational and the line between it and the Levine School is hard to draw. But if it is a fragmentary piece of what is mostly being done there, whether you call the establishment as a whole a school, linguistically or as a reasonable regulator, seems a harder question. And your opponents in specific argue that that's true about what's happening here in that even if the conference activities, some of the conferences are educational in character,  over half of what's being done by event counting is private events that, I mean, maybe, you know, I've gone to weddings where I learned things. So maybe you could think of a wedding as an educational event. But, you know, it's a pretty, you know, that gets even more expansive on what is or is not educational. So that's a lot together.

My point there was simply in response to what I understood to be the court's question saying, couldn't this really open the floodgates and my house could be a school and McDonald's could be a school? My point was simply, as a practical matter, I don't think we've ever gotten there. If that happened, I suspect they'd probably change the regulations.  But what we're looking at right now is a regulation that says look to Webster's and Webster's says an establishment offering specialized instruction. No one has ever thought to change that, obviously, because it hasn't become an issue because for precisely the reasons I described, there are people clamoring to be treated as a school, but  In terms of what's on the books here, I would say that if in fact the BZA had said, well, I'm going to apply some kind of a test that says you have to be at least X, and I think you probably have to defer to them anyway, but there would be an argument that that was actually contrary to what is on the book. The definition, there is no definition of private school. The regulations clearly say where there isn't, look to Webster's,  And what Webster says is an establishment, an establishment, not a home, an establishment, which I think is fairly read as some kind of an institution, offering specialized instruction. Now, in the record, in this case, was Meridian describing its core mission as educating leaders. That's its core mission, educating leaders.  People educate, as Your Honor noted, we educate our children at home in one way. People educate in a whole host of different ways. And I don't think it's for the court or the BZA to dictate, and they are not purporting to, how education must take place or what you call the instructors. The definition in Webster's speaks to instructions.  And that is part of the core mission of this establishment.",

One of the conditions was that the number of  dances, for example, be held to a number that's comports with what is normal for schools and universities at the time. And so, you know, there are a whole host of schools that are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks under the zoning regulations, colleges and universities. And there are concerts, there are weddings, there are all manner of things that happen there, because exactly as your honor pointed out, that's all part of  the educational experience on the one hand, and frankly, as a practical matter, those are nice venues people like to use.

But to a degree, it's a discrete point, which is to what extent in applying it, fulfilling its regulatory function,  is the BZA permitted to or required to consider comprehensive plan elements and zoning maps and all of that. And I found that very confusing. The BZA said not our job and cited some of our cases that seem to say that. But your opponents argue that  So those cases are out of date, that in fact the zoning regulations and the comprehensive plan have been amended in ways that make it quite explicit that the PCA needs to be taking those things into account in various ways. And that there are also some of our cases that now say the PCA is supposed to be looking at this, that, or the other thing.  So I found that all very complicated and I'm curious what your response is on the topic of whether the BZA was correct to say when we're figuring out whether the specific requirements of 901.2 have been met.  we don't need to think about the comprehensive plan. I mean, 9012B itself says, you know, refers to, 9012A says we'll be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations and zoning maps, which I assume are like the generalized policy map and the future land use map.  But then there's some other provisions that are cited that expressly say, either authorize or seem to require the BZA to be thinking about, what does the comprehensive plan show that people care about in planning? And if someone is saying, I want a special exception, and you're trying to figure out as a BZA, are there adverse effects?  Well, let's look and see what the comprehensive plan thinks is important. And if it's undermining the comprehensive plan, then that might be an adverse effect. So can you just shed a little bit of light on whether you think the BCA was right to say, you start saying comprehensive plan and we start zoning out, no pun intended, because that's not our job.",

But to the extent that there are decisions cited with respect in the briefs, particularly with respect to this issue, it's because this court decided in 2019. So it's hardly out of date to the extent that our adversaries have suggested that the Citizens for Responsible Options  case was decided in between the decision by the BZA in this case and the briefing in this court. And that case specifically says that the BZA does not have authority to implement the comprehensive plan. The regulations say that the BZA may, and this is what counsel for the petitioners has latched onto, the BZA may  consider and cite to consistency with the comprehensive plan as one of the bases for its granting and application. So it certainly may look at it, but the BZA correctly cited this court's authority, saying that it did not have authority to specifically implement the comprehensive plan. Our point in our briefs was this is not to say that it is irrelevant to the process, because the Office of Planning  is a body that is tasked with interpreting and applying the comprehensive plan. And so in fact, in its report, which it submitted to the BZA and to which the BZA is legally required to give great weight, the Office of Planning does consider the comprehensive plan in consistency with the comprehensive plan. And so in this case, to make the record even stronger, the BZA said,  We hear you on the comprehensive plan. We're without authority to actually implement the comprehensive plan. That's not our job. However, here are the issues that have been raised, traffic, parking, noise, et cetera. Those are all land use criteria that are woven into the comprehensive plan, both in the land use map and other aspects of the comprehensive plan. And then the BZA,  meticulously walked through each and every one of those. So while it essentially said, not our job, it didn't stop there.

But I mean, I think that your honors understand that we have great concern with the ability of the BZA to consistently and non-arbitrarily apply that one sentence from Webster's dictionary. And again, we're not disputing the fact that the regulations adopt the definition. It's simply that it's the BZA's job to apply the definition  I mean, it seems quite easy to apply consistently and non-arbitrarily to me.",

And I guess that makes it very difficult for neighbors to know how to address these types of applications.  Um, but yeah, it's something that should have been explored at a minimum. I do want to then go to the issue of impacts because I didn't spend a lot of time talking about that. And, um,  My miss them brought up the fact that there were some impacts that were raised in the testimony that she's arguing are not fairly traceable to it being a school or to the relief side. And it's very clear when we started this argument I pointed specifically to that.  That passage that portion of testimony that indicates that this is fairly traceable to the to the school which is not only building a new conference center, but despite it.  It's assertions that it's not really going to be augmenting operations at all, it is adding a conference center. It is an additional conference center whereas now all of their operations are in the mansions.  That's what the applicant is saying, that they are going to build this building to relocate the parking garage, to redo this entire scheme, and to factor in this new residential project. So it's not that the impacts are only traceable to something that's available by right, and I'm gonna discuss that in a moment.  But the project itself is intimately tied with the expansion or the addition of this new conference center. Can I ask you a question about impacts it's very detailed and I just, it just popped into my head and I don't remember the record, clearly answering it though that doesn't mean it doesn't, I just don't remember it.",

The ANC, in her testimony and after the fact, also addressed the problems with the MOUs and the fact specifically that with enforceability and not only related to the MOU, but the fact that  The whole process basically relies on good faith when these petitioners have been trying to work with this applicant for many years and abiding by MOUs. And the testimony shows and the record shows that they have consistently violated those. And so here, the petitioners are really saying,  The conditions that we understand to be useful, I could find the site. I don't have it available right now as to where this came up in the hearing. My understanding is that they would have wanted them integrated into the order. But simply referencing the MOUs raises a variety of issues that Ms. Fox-Perry also raised.  In particular, we can look to the, the Department of Planning report here, and we cite this in our brief, where in analyzing the impacts here.  The Department of Planning basically relied on, the report did not assess MIC's operations or otherwise indicate that any attempt had been made to determine whether the operations were appropriate or the impacts.  I think we're well over rebuttal time and I'm not sure now is the time to start getting that far into the weeds.",
