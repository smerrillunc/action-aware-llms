The chamber, as I will refer to the appellate here, will present that the chamber was not obligated or bound to pay for the appellee's fees. And the plain language of the contract is unambiguous. The contract or the engagement letter is unambiguous. It does not obligate the chamber, nor does the extrinsic evidence, if found to be ambiguous, to bind the chamber.

One such being Erica Wellington, who asked who was ultimately responsible for the legal fees to which Mark London replied. I anticipate that the group who is funded the litigation to this point will continue to fund it.  And at that point, when the question was asked, the DC chamber never contributed to the funding of the litigation. As time went on in January of 2016, Mark London reached out to Erica Wellington and asked or prompt her to alert the group that their retainer is running low. Could more funds be raised? And then in May of 2016, the issue came up again and  Erica Wellington asked Mark London, who is responsible for the legal fees? And Mark London replied, it's for the committee to pay. And that committee is a group that was known to Mark London that would be lack of a better, or the term that was used past the hat around the business community to hope that fees would be contributed for this effort.  Well, that committee wasn't known at the time this contract began or the contract was made because it wasn't even in existence, correct? That's correct. But to that point on, I believe, August 19th, there was a conversation between Harry Wingo and Mark London.

It's got a part that says you won't be, and then another part that says in addition to legal fees, you will be through sources.

Chamber was the one promising to raise the money from its own various members. Again, this is not saying that it would be paid by various members of the business community. It would be paid by various members of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, which was what we were told.  Just a brief chronology would help, I think, here. When this initiative first came up, the D.C. Chamber organized the business community to oppose it. And Mr. Wingo, in fact, gave testimony with the knowledge of the Executive Committee of the Board at the Board of Elections hearing to stop the initiative from even being accepted.  At that time, D.C. 's Chambers Director of Government Relations, Erica Wadlington, organized a subcommittee of chamber members to lead the legal challenge. This is found at page 211 of the appendix. At pages 208 to 209 of the appendix, Ms. Wadlington added Andrew Klein to this committee to make sure that all the work would be done by the chamber to lead this fight.  When the Board of Elections accepted the initiative on July 21st, the very next thing that happened was on July 23rd, 2015, Mr. Wingo met with the executive committee of the chamber. And this is what their minutes of that meeting reflect. I'm quoting, President Wingo asked the committee for approval for moving forward with the chamber, taking the lead in challenging the DC Board of Elections decision  to allow a minimum wage ballot initiative and Harry Wingo filing a complaint in D.C. Superior Court in his personal capacity as a registered voter in D.C. The motion was approved by a voice vote. The committee discussed the next steps of raising a legal fund of approximately $75,000 to $100,000 and finding a law firm to represent the chamber in this matter.",

You agree that on this point, at least, the issue is whether  as a given for a minute that the engagement letter is ambiguous about whether the chamber is legally responsible for the fees. And then the issue is, okay, what's the extrinsic evidence one way or another? Could a reasonable fact finder find for the chamber or against the chamber, if that's the inquiry? There is, I guess, testimony from Mr. Wingo describing his understandings and his conversations with Mr. London.  which was it was a pass the hat operation among the members of the chamber, but also other people, even non-members of the chamber. But Mr. Wingo says in his deposition, I'm paraphrasing, tell me if you think I'm paraphrasing unfairly. And so it seems to me, at least arguably, that reasonable fact finders might agree with you. Look, the only way of reading the sequence of events in the agreement is,  that the lawyers can't be understood to have agreed to do all this work and have no promise of payment from any entity that was enforceable. I get that line of thought for sure. But your opponent's argument is, if you consider the extrinsic evidence, you can look at it differently, which is the lawyers agreed, both in terms of maybe the more natural reading of the engagement letter, but also the extrinsic evidence. What they agreed to was they were going to have a nominal plaintiff. He's not responsible for the fees. There's a plan about how to finance it. The plan is the chamber's going to go hand-in-hand  to people who are legal entities other than the chamber, and the lawyers kind of bore the risk of, you know, if that didn't pan out, then the lawyers bore the risk of it. And maybe they could sue for quantum heroin. Maybe they could sue for, if the chamber didn't do well enough at trying to fundraise, maybe they could sue for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Why couldn't a reasonable fact finder be unsure about which of those two is right and have the judgment depend on how the fact finder assessed the evidence and the credibility of witnesses and the like?",

In this case, the parties that were participating in the initiative litigation were Mr. Wingo as the challenger, and the Board of Elections is the formal defendant.

And then the Office of the Attorney General, after the initial rulings by Judge Maurice Ross, finding that the Board of Elections was not properly constituted and ruling in favor of the chamber and Mr. Wingo, then the Office of the Attorney General intervened.  and asked for reconsideration of those rulings, starting another three months of litigation with now three opponents, the OAG, the proposer,  and the Board of Elections.

Chamber of Commerce who initiated this, directed the work,  took credit for when it won. They made the announcement that they had won. They understood it. The only time they didn't understand this contract was after they got into a dispute with Mr. Wingo and he was forced out. And it was only then that they started making excuses that they weren't the ones responsible to pay this and that they wanted other entities to step up. This is stuff we never saw in real time. We saw it only in discovery.  that the D. C. Chamber had these internal disputes with Mr Wingo about paying the fees and that the new D. C. Leader Miss Singletary said, Well, we want other entities to pay this. We're not gonna pay anymore. And that's when Mr Wingo said, Well, you ought to at least pay this $10,000. And she said no.  So that all happened six, eight months after the July meeting with Mr. Wingo when we were retained and occurred as the case was getting ready to be up on appeal.",

However, the judge abused her discretion and tried to resolve the ambiguity herself.  and then reviewed the facts and the light most favorable to the moving party, which was the plaintiffs. And that was also Raza Fowler, the standard in the Nader case. The lower court needed to stand in the position of a reasonable juror acting reasonably and determine that there is no way that you could find for the non-moving party. And she did not review the facts in our favor. And she also said that she was uncertain of what a reasonable juror would do. She didn't meet the standard anywhere.  So then we raised a point about the meeting minutes, the court should have allowed parole evidence to be provided to clear up any uncertainty in the meeting minutes. And as it turns out, there is uncertainty. Was the chamber gonna file an amicus brief? Did that ever happen? No. So the chamber did not get its full opportunity to litigate the case and have a reasonable juror to determine any of the ambiguity here. Lastly, we have  that you can't guarantee rates for raising funds. That would be a new nuanced legal standard that if you're gonna raise funds, you have to guarantee that you can raise the funds or somehow be obligated. That is not the case here. Also, we have just a balancing harm. If you're looking at the blind scales of justice, you're saying, is it okay for a client to overbill after being told, look, it's gonna be $100,000.

And because the government agrees that suppression is warranted if this court finds that the police's discovery of items of evidence in Mr. Lee's backyard violated the Fourth Amendment, I will begin and focus my time with that central issue.  The trial court erred in its backyard emergency aid ruling for two reasons, entry and scope. First, the government failed to carry its burden to prove that police had an objectively reasonable basis to believe entry was necessary to provide emergency aid to some unknown gunshot victim. And second, the government failed to establish that evidence discovered in the backyard was observed in plain view while police were engaged in a strictly circumscribed search tailored to locate an injured person.  So with respect to the initial entry into the backyard under the emergency aid doctrine, the government failed to provide. Let me ask you to, let me ask you to focus on that question, Mr. Whitehead.",

And they didn't make any suggestion that the blood that they saw within Mr. Lee's property was anything but Mr. Lee's blood. Because the blood that led from Mr. Thompson to Mr. Thompson, as the Detective Evans testified, he was a hunter. He could tell the direction of that particular blood trail. There was a pool of blood at several locations on the way to Mr. Thompson.  It's very apparent that this is a different blood trail and that is coming from outside of Mr. Lee's.",

But when you see that the blood droplets lead from the side yard which again the trial court said was consistent with what Mr Lee said to the front.  um, in the, in that French porch area. And then there are more blood drops that go from the porch to the sidewalk to where mr. Lee is standing that, that yes, a reasonable officer, you didn't ask him any more questions. Certainly could have, I mean, mr. Mr. Lee was perfectly cooperative and was with an officer the entire time that he was in an ambulance and at the hospital. Um, but, but a reasonable officer would have, um,  Or there wouldn't have been a reasonable basis to believe that there was some other injured person in the backyard, not hearing anything. Mr. Lee didn't say that there, he said that there was nobody else at the house and said that he was shot in his hand and they have a towel there, which gives the strong impression that he went back into his house to get this towel to cover up his hand and cover up his injury.  And that was something that he showed the police along with his graze wound to his abdomen. Again, those things are fully consistent with the type of shots or the type of injuries that he had, that there would be these, what the police described as these blood droplets. And they weren't photographed either. I mean, this wasn't a situation like Mr. Thompson where they have, you know, blood and pools  They had the singular blood droplets that we would argue is fully explained just as an Evans, where after you have an account from Mr Evans and Miss Miss Taylor his girlfriend about the domestic dispute that they had that when the officer went to the apartment and saw that there was blood on the floor, and  inviting apartment door that was open, that he could not have gone into that apartment without a warrant because that blood had been explained by the injury and by the accounts of both Mr. Evans and Ms. Taylor.

They're given differing versions of the altercation, but no indication that there is any third person involved. And the court ended up saying, well, it is always possible that the police don't have the full story. But they had an account that would explain fully what went on, and there's a dispute about who was sort of the aggressor. And the bare possibility that they don't know the full story or someone is lying to them  to go into a house on emergency entry. This case seems harder, whether hard enough is, you know, enough harder is the issue in a way, but it seems harder in that there are a lot of, not just, well, it's possible that somebody's lying, but there are a bunch of unanswered questions that seem, you know, how was, how'd the dog get back in? Well, you know, where'd the towel come from? Where are all these other blood? Why is he not mentioning any other shootings, even though there are shots fired in the area roughly, you know,  again, a little unclear where the area is and how contemporaneous, but there's just like a lot going on here that I think a reasonable officer would have had concerns about beyond just, oh, I have no specific reason to have questions, but it's always possible. So it seems like it's a harder case than ever. Well, I think that, I'm sorry, I think that there, yes, there is, there is a lot going on and there's a considerable amount of investigation that the police would ultimately have to do.",

    "text": " And I think what Evans says and what it does say is that, well, is this situation where by Mr. Lee's account that the government presented evidence to show that he might've been lying to cover up for the fact that he was, that somebody else was injured in the backyard. And that's simply not the case. And I think what good hypothetical would be, okay, so say Mr. Lee, he gives them the exact same information.  And when the police look to the side yard, instead of seeing blood droplets, and I hate to be gruesome here, they see a severed hand. In that instance, unlike Evans or Wolf or these other cases, then there is something that is specific to the backyard that shows that Mr. Lee might have been lying to cover up the fact that somebody else is injured back there. Because Mr. Lee shows up, he has both of his hands. We know that by seeing this severed hand that there's  There's definitely a reasonable basis to believe that there's some other injured person that's into the backyard. That's not the case here. There's a lot going on. But again, Mr. Brown says he was shot in Southern Avenue by somebody that fits the description of Mr. Thompson. Police go to Mr. Thompson. He doesn't say anything about when and where he shot. And neither does Mr. Brown say when he shot. But Mr. Thompson appears to have shot himself in the foot.  And the closest that he can get or that that shooting gets to Mr. Lee's house is on the sidewalk in front of the property. But because there's no specific link that leads the police to say that not only did the shooting happen or that there's some other evidence of some unknown fourth victim on Mr. Lee's property, but it has to be specific to his backyard. And that's simply not there. Again, the only evidence that shows that there's a possibility  of an injured person in the backyard are the blood droplets that are specifically on that side yard. And with Mr. Lee's account, it's perfectly consistent and also fully explains those blood droplets. So Mr. Lee doesn't have, it's not incumbent upon him to solve all crimes for the police.  It's just, does he give enough information that fully explains this blood that's on the side yard that could potentially lead to an injured party? And in this case, yes, he does. So when you focus in on that particular piece of evidence and where the side yard and what the police could possibly be thinking about whether or not there's an injured person, Mr. Lee's account and his injuries explain that blood.  I think what's also important is that the police didn't just violate the Fourth Amendment on the entry, but they also violated the Fourth Amendment in scope. And Mincy was very clear that you have to have a strictly circumscribed search, and it has to be tailored to the exigency which justifies that initiation. And in this case, the government presented no evidence. In fact, the evidence that they presented was that the police were engaged in a full-scale search  Nothing that like Earl and this Gordon Harris have said that a protective sweep is something that's an appropriate type of search that can be conducted to satisfy whether or not something is strictly circumscribed. And a protective sweep is quick and limited, a visual cursory inspection. It has to be carefully tailored.  And the police can ask you about terminology and the framework here in booth.",

In Brigham City, there's really not any reference to a scope type requirement. There's a general requirement under the Fourth Amendment that searches be reasonable in scope. So do you  find any differences among the search would have to be reasonable in scope. It has to be narrowly tailored. It has to be reasonably circumscribed.

    "text": "Well, I think that there's two, really. It's strictly circumscribed because Mid-C is not about entry. Where a police officer was shot,  in a home, the entry to  to conduct an emergency sweep was certainly permissible in that case. The issue was whether or not there was a homicide exception, and the police could just hang out for four days without securing a warrant. And in that case, that's where the language comes from, strictly circumscribed by the exigency that justifies the initiation. And this carrot and booth kind of took from that in discussing, tailored carefully, the police can do no more than is reasonably necessary to ascertain whether or not there's an injured person.  So there's all these different permutations of that but I think what it, what it does is it really drills down on what's important here, and that this has to be a very narrowly tailored search, and it cannot go into this full search. There's a discussion within Earl and Harris about how protective sleep visual cursory inspection.  And that's exactly opposite of what the officers did in this case, the manner in which they conducted their search in the, in the backyard is is so material and the way they discuss their search in the backyard is just canvassing looking for evidence.  multiple, multiple times so they just they talk about their search in the backyard is just canvassing and looking for evidence and that's how they come upon finding very tiny minuscule pieces of evidence.

    "text": " I'll put it this way, even if it were the case, the blood, the record shows that the blood trail actually ends on the side yard. It's very because the gate itself is somewhere in the middle of this side yard that extends the length of the house. And that's the appendices that that both myself and the government submitted that the the detective testified that the blood droplets were on both sides of this gate, but that they only extended to the side of this porch.  And it was very clear that the blood drops or trail, however you want to characterize it, ended before the police got to the actual backyard, and they were not in a position to see the bullet or the shell casing that was on the ground. In fact, what the record is clear about is that the bullet and shell casing were found  after five minutes or so. And so, as we said in our briefs, this is a small D.C. open row house backyard, and the government didn't present any evidence otherwise.  And it doesn't take five minutes to search. I mean, they immediately found that the blood trail ended on the side yard. And it doesn't take five minutes to search this area and do a sweep to find if anybody's there or that the end of the blood trail is there because they find that almost immediately. What it takes is just a few seconds. And I think the best way is to have a contrast with how the detectives, because they knew how to testify and conduct a proper  sweep for purposes of the emergency aid doctrine. They used taking a look at their language. They talked about entering the interior of the house in terms of a protective sweep. They discussed going through three floors of this house with multiple rooms on each floor. You have small intricate areas like bathrooms and closets. You have furniture. They did this whole search within three to four minutes.  and then shut down the operation once they found out, within the scope of the search, that there was an open bag of drugs on the bed. And that's in stark contrast to the way that the police conducted their search in the backyard, which is canvassing for evidence, just looking around, and lo and behold, there's some really minuscule pieces of evidence that are on the concrete pad. They look up where nobody's going to be hanging around. If they were looking for a bird, maybe,  that they were looking at the second story window and find a bullet hole. And then there's a singular blood drop that's on the back porch. By then they would have long found that there was nobody that was in need of emergency aid and they should have shut down their search as soon as they determined that there was nobody there.  And that was something that they did not do. It was something that the government did not prove that the plain view doctrine applies here. That even if these items were in plain view, they did not prove that they found the items within the strictly circumscribed search. This cursory visual inspection where the police didn't know more than to reasonably ascertain whether or not there was an emergency and that there was somebody that was there that needed help.

Um, I'll focus on the backyard search as well, since that's where the,  focus has been in appellant's argument. And I think the key here is what the police were seeing on the scene was not explained by the defendant's account. The defendant said he was shot in the side yard and the police saw blood trail going into the backyard. The defendant said he ran from the area after being shot and the police saw blood on the front steps of the house. The defendant's account only included his shooting  And the police saw that there had been a shooting directly in front of his house. That's Brandon Thompson that the defendant didn't mention. And I think it's important in framing all of this that the defendant's own account was of a masked gunman coming up to him in his side yard and randomly shooting him. So this is not like the Evans situation where you have a domestic dispute, every reason to think it's just these two people who would be involved.  The defendant's account instead suggests a very dangerous situation where there well would be reason to fear further victims in this case. In terms of whether or not the account included just blood in the side yard or into the back, I think the record fairly and  pretty clearly demonstrates that the blood trail that the police saw and described went into the backyard. I just ask you about, you say went into the backyard.",

And so I think the question is then what does it mean to have an objectively reasonable basis? But I think that's a secondary question from whether or not this panel is bound by prior decisions saying probable cause. In terms of how we think objectively reasonable basis compares to probable cause, we think it differs in a couple of ways. One is in how it applies and the other is in the quantum of proof.  So in terms of how it applies, the Supreme Court in Ryburn v. Huff applying this standard explains that courts should be wary of second-guessing police determinations of whether or not this is a dangerous or emergency situation and that the police are forced to be making second decisions and therefore there has to be some deference to that. And I think that is not typically what you would find in a probable cause or  reasonable articulable suspicion analysis. Normally, that's just seen as a kind of line in the sand. It's not a deference to police force to make split-second decisions. And then the other difference is in the quantum of proof, which is that this court in Evans recognized that, said that the 10th Circuit had suggested probable cause is a higher standard of proof. The First Circuit had said it was equivalent  Since then, the First Circuit, in a panel decision, has said no objectively reasonable basis is a lower standard. So we agree there's no consensus on there being a probable cause as a higher standard, but we think that is where the courts are moving, especially the federal courts.",

And the case we cited, whose name is escaping me at the moment, talks about how when the police in that case are making entry into the backyard, the fact that a couple of hours had elapsed since the shooting, that actually suggested a higher level of emergency because someone could be bleeding out at that point in the backyard.  And so we do not think that it undermines the police actions, especially in this case where you've got the police following blood trails. It's not as though they're sitting there twiddling their thumbs. They're following blood trails to try to determine if there are other victims where you have three shootings in a very close area where the defendant is describing this as a random shooting with a mask on them. And so we think that does  support, we think it supports or certainly doesn't hurt the entry in this case. And I think you also have cases like Michigan v. Fisher, where the police arrive, see the defendant kind of ranting inside of his house. It's unclear when exactly his injuries would have occurred, but the police don't say an objectively reasonable basis to go in. It doesn't have to be seconds after the shooting.  And if there are I did also want to touch on what the police did when they got into the bath, got into the backyard, which is that the description of the police taking five minutes to find the evidence is not accurate, is not supported by the record.

Once the detective says he's in the backyard for five minutes or so,  The other time he says he's in the backyard for a couple of minutes.

And the Tenth Circuit in the Gambino-Salvo-Leo case that we cite has said the second part of the test is whether the manner and scope of the entry  is reasonable. So we think it's just... And what do you make of your opponent's reliance on at least the phrase carefully circumscribed in MNC? I mean, I think a couple of things. First, we think Arizona v. Hicks explicitly deals with that phrase and says that when there are items that are out in plain view, the police are not expanding the scope of their search.  when they're looking at those items in plain view, even though in the Arizona v. Hicks case, it's a potential stolen stereo completely unrelated to the shooting emergency that the police are responding to. So I don't think it's correct that the police are precluded from kind of looking closer at things that they see in plain view when they're in a place that they're allowed to be. But I think the more fundamental point is the point that was making earlier, which is that  police here are not just looking for an injured person. What they're trying to resolve is whether this fourth, this new blood trail that they see going into the backyard, does that represent a fourth victim or not? And what they need to do to resolve that is to look at the very pieces of evidence that they ultimately find. It's the blood drop on the back door, the shell casing, the unspent ammunition that  suggests to the police, oh, this is in fact the site of a shooting, not a place that a fourth injured victim passed through, and therefore we should be going, we should be following the blood trail the other way. But I think in order to resolve what to do about the blood trail, which is what's justifying entry into the backyard, the police do need to be looking at exactly that evidence. The police cannot just look  and see if there's an injured person because it could be that someone went into the backyard as the blood drop next to the back door indeed suggested in this case. That's what the police had to resolve in this case.",

They also, I would also point to, you know, Judge Thompson and Judge McClease his question about the logic of, of, of not challenging or not challenging the entry into the home.  And I think that's an important distinction to make. They never made that argument that there was still probable cause to enter the house without any of the backyard evidence that the blood trail allowed the police officers to go into that house until oral argument. And I think that that speaks to also the side yard, that there was no probable cause to go into that side yard.  irrespective of the shootings that took place. Because again, there's no connection to the backyard specifically with the other shootings. And I mentioned probable cause because just to correct the government, as late as Ball, this court has said that Oliver has equated probable cause to the reasonable basis to believe standard and citing how it fits well with the perceived emergency in contrast with the  basis for perspective arrest for which probable cause is traditional language. And the Supreme Court has never explicitly said that there is a difference of standard or quantum of evidence between probable cause and reasonable basis to believe. Oliver completely goes through an analysis as to why it makes sense that probable cause is equivalent to reasonable basis to believe. With respect to the clarification on the amount of time that it took  the detective to find evidence? Well, first of all, the government seems to suggest that just because there are blood drops, that they have an opportunity and the emergency aid exception allows them to go search for all kinds of evidence. And once they find that evidence, then they can make more determinations. But that's not what MNC and that's not what Booth require. It requires something that's strictly circumscribed. And it took five minutes or so, and this is on page 160, as the government said,  The witnesses asked how long it took to spot the bullet casing and the ammunition. The answer was, I don't recall it taking that long to find. We weren't out there for 15 to 20 minutes, maybe five minutes or so. And so when you look and contrast again between the protective sweep that was conducted inside the house, three to four minutes, and what it took five minutes or so of just canvassing and searching for evidence,  Um, it's, it's the government has not proved their burden that the evidence found in the backyard was appropriately viewed within plain view while they were conducting a strictly circumscribed or tailored, uh, tailored carefully, uh, search that was specific to looking for an injured individual. Um, I see that my time has expired again, so I would respectfully request this court. I'd like to, like to ask a question.",

I know it says Gregory Patterson on the screen. I apologize for that. That's my client.  Um, and, um, I am here, um, to, um, discuss with you the challenges we have to Mr. Patterson's convictions based on the fourth amendment. Um, we maintain that Mr. Patterson's conviction should be overturned for the reason that, um, he, um, the, the police had no reason to believe, um, or had no articulable basis for believing.  That he was engaged in or about to engage in criminal activity or a reasonable basis to believe that he was armed and dangerous. Um, looking at the totality of the circumstances, uh, surrounding the stop of. Mr. Patterson, there are a number of indicators that he was not engaged in any criminal activity. Um, he was walking along, minding his own business, watching a video on his iPhone.  He was not engaged in any furtive gestures. He didn't try to flee. He wasn't nervous. Even though the police ran up to him in almost an accostive type way and started questioning him very loudly about whether or not he had a gun, he behaved very calmly in response to all of that.  and just sort of ask them what was going on. The government has argued in its briefs that the shot sound of a gunfire in the area on the shot spotter technology was a basis for the police to believe that Mr. Patterson had a gun. I think there are a number of problems with that argument. The first is that it's not- Before you get into the details of that line of thinking, I wanna just make sure we're in the right framework.",

Um, it's, it's kind of odd to assume that the two of them not knowing that there was alcohol on Johnson's car were even associated with each other in any way. Um, so I don't think it's reasonable for, it wouldn't have been reasonable for officer Rogers to presume that there was any connection with Johnson. Um, I know that Lewis talks about, um,  Assuming a reasonable assumption that someone in the immediate vicinity of a person found with a gun may also have a gun, but these two individuals were not in the immediate vicinity of each other. The trial judge says that, you know, there's at least 20 feet, if not more from the videos. It looks like there's maybe 30 feet between the two of them.  Um, Mr. Patterson was engaged in a completely unrelated activity. He's watching the video on his phone. He's not. Communicating with Mr. Johnson. He's not even looking at Mr. Johnson's direction. And when he's told that a gun is found on Mr. Johnson, he's sort of shocked. He's just totally surprised by that. Um, he didn't even know who Mr. Johnson was when, when officer Rogers said we found a gun, he was, he responds, where did you find the gun? He said,  He had a gun and he was, who had a gun? He didn't even know who Officer Rogers was talking about. So I think it was a stretch for the police to assume that there was any connection between, for Officer Rogers to assume there was any connection between the two of them. Are there any other questions about the connection between Mr. Patterson and Mr. Johnson?  I think you can go on with whatever other points you want to make for us. So the last thing I'd like to talk about is the bulge in Mr. Patch supposed bulge and Mr. Patterson's.  waste area because, um, the government has relied on that as a reason for stopping, um, mr. Patterson. Um, and again, in this instance, there was not enough provided, not enough testimony provided below to support the conclusion that it was reasonable to believe that, um, the bulge on mr. Patterson was a gun.  Officer Rogers did not testify about the firmness of the object, whether the object appeared to have any kind of weight, the contours of the object, the relative size of the object. He simply said that there was a bulge around his waist area that was not consistent with human anatomy. And I think this court's case law is pretty clear.  that that's not enough to jump to the conclusion that it's not an innocent item, and that it's a gun.

So  Um, as the trial court concluded on page 83 of the March 4th transcript, it was reasonable to infer that, uh, that appellant and Johnson were among the persons who were drinking what was on the hood of the vehicle, because it looked like it had been set up for some sort of group activity. Um, so appellant had a white styrofoam cup. If you look at government's, uh, exhibit number, I believe it's number. I'm not sure. I think it's one. Um, it's the still frame.  There was a white styrofoam cut next to Johnson. On page 80, sorry, page 65 through 66 of the trial transcript, officer made clear that he saw a talent walking from where Johnson was. It would be a group drinking activity.  that provides the basis for, and the fact that Officer Rogers saw a pallet walking from where Johnson was, that allowed the court to infer that they were associates.

Um, we think that, um, because officer Rogers had reasonable articulable suspicion, um, that appellant was engaged in, um, possession of an open container of alcohol, refer to his polka, um, that he could stop appellant and that  once he had lawfully stopped an appellant and was in a lawful position to view the bulge in appellant's waistband, that that provided reasonable articulable suspicion for the frisk. There are the additional factors that add additional suspicion, but we don't think that the association companionship, however the court would like to look at it, is a necessary factor to our profiling.  In terms of, I guess, the second part of addressing your Honor's question, in a number of cases, I guess, starting with Lewis versus United States, this court indicated that if a, we'll call them a primary defendant or an associate or the other defendant, if a primary defendant is found in possession of a gun,  then all companions of the arrestee within the immediate vicinity capable of accomplishing a harmful assault on the officer are constitutionally subjected to the cursory pat-down, reasonably necessary to give assurance that they are unarmed. So there doesn't have to be any, and that's been followed in cases like Trice and commented on in Williamson as well as  I'm forgetting the last one, as well as United States versus Bennett. And to be clear, you said that you don't think the automatic companion rule, if you can call it that, makes a necessary contribution.",

In the trio of cases that I've also cited, Williamson, Trice, and Bennett, this court has elaborated on Lewis in factually distinct, distinguishable scenarios where police are responding to  report of a crime in a fast-moving situation. And rather than developing reasonable articulable suspicion that the defendant is engaged in a crime, they are also permitted to stop, to frisk a defendant as a witness. That isn't the line of cases that we think govern this case. This isn't so much a witness case. It's a reasonable articulable suspicion that appellant was engaged in a crime case.  Um, so I guess that's why they're not given the focus in our brief. Um, but we, we do think that it would be, uh, enough under Lewis, um, and by the language of Lewis. Um, I'd also like to, uh, address, um, uh, appellant's argument that the, um, I guess the bulge or the description of the bulge wasn't enough as I, as I understand the argument. And, um, I would, uh, highlight for the court officer Rogers testimony  Um, on page, um, page 19, I believe of the March 4th trial transcript. Um, when asked about why, uh, the, uh, when asked by the prosecutor, why officer Rogers believed that that was a, that it was a gun, um, officer Rogers responded that it didn't look consistent with the human anatomy. And, um, and this is the part that appellant leaves out. It was protruding out of his waistband.  Um, and that, that makes a difference. Um, the fact that it's a waistband, um, and not a pocket makes a difference even under Singleton. Um, which is the case that I understand appellate to be relying on. Um, the reasoning of Singleton, uh, is that a generic bulge and a waste and a, sorry, in a pocket, um, is capable of too many innocent explanations to provide a basis for reasonable articulable suspicion. That was a case where a police officer on the street saw a defendant helping a woman out of a house.  and saw a bulge in his pocket and furtive gestures toward the pocket. And the court did, as appellant notes, say that that was the minimum, that a generic bulge in a pocket had to be accompanied by something more. But this isn't a generic bulge in a pocket. It's a bulge in a waistband protruding out of a waistband. Officer Rogers' full body-worn camera is an evidence. If the court goes to the 350,  through four minutes and seven second marks or minute marks of Officer Rogers body worn camera, we would submit that you can see the significance of the bulge, the prominence of the bulge. You can see that the, and obviously this is something that Officer Rogers learned afterward, but you can see that it is just about the entire gun is protruding out of his waistband. It's the barrel of the gun that's in his waistband.",

We think that there was more here than there was in Singleton. Unlike in Singleton, where an officer on the street with no reason to suspect the defendant there of any crime saw a bulge and thought that that was a firearm here,  Officer Rogers was responding to the sound of gunshots in a high crime area. Uh, at 10 30 at night, um, appellants, uh, associate or companion had just been found in possession of a firearm. Um, and that's much more, um, firearm and, uh, I guess gunshots related or adjacent, um, information that the officer had here than, um, the officer in Singleton had, um, certainly. Um, so we think that  Singleton is clearly distinguishable on those facts, notwithstanding the fact that, as Appellant rightly points out, that there weren't furtive gestures here. That is something that would detract from reasonable articulable suspicion.

He says that the defendant.  was somewhere in excess of 21 feet from the vehicle, referring to the vehicle where Mr. Johnson was. But I think the video speaks for itself. If you look at the video, you can see that there is a considerable distance between my client and Mr. Johnson at the time the police arrived.  I would also like to address this issue of the bulge being in Mr. Patterson's waistband. There is no way that you could tell on the video whether the bulge is because he has a pocket inside of his jacket or because it's  around his waistband. He's got on three layers of clothing. And I think that when Officer Rogers testified that it was in his waistband, he was referring to what they discovered after they searched my client and saw that it was in fact in the waistband.
