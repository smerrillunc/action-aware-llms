Your honors, the key question before the court is whether the defendant, Mr. General, was in custody when detectives questioned him and took his DNA during a lengthy interview at the station house about the murder of Ms. Deborah McKinney. We submit Mr. General was in custody for four main reasons.  First, the station house setting raises significant Miranda concerns. Second, the detectives took Mr. General's DNA during the interview with the saliva swab. Third, the nature of the questioning was accusatory. And fourth, the detectives never told Mr. General that he was not under arrest and that he was free to decline to answer their questions.  Simply put, the detectives did not treat Mr. General as a mere witness who was there to help investigate a crime. The detectives treated him as the prime suspect for one hour and 27 minutes of closed-door questioning.",

To start, Graham was a close case where the court did recognize that there were factors on both sides of the ledger, but the court says the balance tilts against custody. And there are several things here that distinguishing factors here from Graham that make the balance tilt the other way toward custody.  First, in Graham, the defendant, the court says, did go to the station house to assist the police as a witness in their investigation. And he was treated like a witness. Because of the other factors, the nature of the questioning and the taking of his DNA here, Mr. General was not treated that way. Second, the detectives in Graham also left the door open. And at one point, the defendant in Graham walked out of the room to use the restroom.  And here, the door was closed. And then third, the detectives in Graham did not.",

    "text": "Yes, two points on that, Your Honor. The first is,  The Turner case was resting on similar facts where in Turner, the defendant accompanied the police, he technically agreed to accompany police to the station house. And police in that case told the defendant, we'll take you wherever you want once the interview is wrapped up. And indeed the defendant there did walk out of the interview at the end. But the court still in Turner placed emphasis on the station house setting  and how the interview was conducted. But there are also three other points in the video that show it was really the detectives who were controlling when Mr. General was going to walk out of that room. And in the first two, Mr. General is trying to wrap up the interview and expressing his desire to leave or go have a cigarette break.  But right when he does that, immediately, the detectives begin with another line of questioning, completely ignoring his desire to wrap up the interview. And then in the third instance,  Uh, he wants to leave again, but this time detective Brigadini says, actually, can you give us a minute? And the detectives leave the room and shut the door. And mr. General is left in there for about nine minutes in a closed room by himself. And he even asks, asks out loud in this time, what is taking so long? And it's not until the one hour and 27 minute Mark, once the detectives reenter,  and say, quote, unquote, are you ready to rock? And they allow him to leave. And so I think that shows they were really controlling when he could leave. And at that point, Mr. General had been subjected to accusatory questioning and they had taken his DNA. And it's in circumstances like this, where this court has said in a number of cases that  whether police advisement is an important factor. And here, Mr. General was not told that he was not under arrest or that he could decline to answer their questions. And so the fact that police didn't advise him of these two things should be an important factor in this context too.",

Now, I think police have a number of means at their disposal to make an individual feel restrained to a degree that amounts to formal arrest. And they don't have to use all of them at the same time to trigger custody. And our submission is that the tactics employed here, the questioning, and the taking of the DNA is one way to trigger custody. And I'll save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.",

    "text": "Good afternoon. May it please the court. Patricia Heffernan on behalf of the United States. One just factual issue I wanted to clear up. The record is silent as to whether or not the defendant was told he was not under arrest. Because at the motions hearing, neither party asked the detective whether the appellant was told that he was not under arrest.  With respect to Judge Farron's questioning, it's clear in this case that the badgering issue wasn't presented and also that the argument based on the nature of the questions  generally was not before the motions court and the evidence, which is the videotape of the interview was not in evidence before the motions court. While it's true the prosecutor stated she could play the entire video if the court wanted to,  The video wasn't played, it wasn't offered, and it wasn't accepted into evidence. At page 21 of the transcript, the court explicitly states that it received into evidence several exhibits identified as Exhibits 321A, B, and C.  And so all that was before the court in terms of its custody ruling were those three clips. And just backing up more generally, the transcript of this motions hearing is very, very, very short. And what is abundantly clear is that the defendant's appellant's custody theory was that at the time he left the apartment, he was in custody. So his argument was the entire  everything was custodial. So his argument was at point A, I was in custody. Now we're hearing at point D, I was in custody, maybe at point G, I was in custody, or certainly by point N, I was in custody. And that is not something that was raised, litigated, or ruled upon by the motions court. And with respect to the three clips that are in evidence, my opponent says that those clips themselves show badgering, but that  That conclusory statement doesn't establish that fact. That's not briefed. It's not described. I'm trying to remember off the top of my head those clips precisely. Certainly the first clip was just the defendant appellant sitting alone in the interview room.  So that clip doesn't support that argument. And with respect to the taking of the DNA, that again seems to be yet another new argument being raised at oral argument as to why this is now custodial. And a couple things with respect to that. First of all, the statements  that appellant is complaining about were made well before the taking of the DNA. So even if this court were to now go down the road of considering whether taking DNA necessarily, I guess our appellant is suggesting that anytime DNA is taken, that renders a situation custodial. Here, the taking of the DNA was consensual. And as I said, it came well after the statements that appellant complains about.  So if this became custodial at minute 44, that doesn't answer, that has no bearing on the statements that Appellant made 20 minutes earlier, nor for that matter does when Appellant actually left, that again, he agreed to wait for nine minutes at the very end of the videotape, well after all the statements had been made. And so the fact that the detectives asked him if he would hang around for another few minutes,  that can't bear on the custody question.",

White in 2013, which was a few years after Graham was decided. And in that case, we seemed to focus on the fact that where the  person in custody is not specifically advised by police that he or she doesn't have to answer the questions, that fact might tend to lean more toward finding the situation to be custodial custody. And if it's a case that you, I don't mean to spring this on you, if it's not a case that immediately comes to mind, but in that case, the issue was that, you know, we found it decisive that where  the party in custody is not advised specifically that they don't have to answer the questions.

I don't believe that it's black  letter per se custody in this jurisdiction that where a defendant does not advise that he does not have to answer questions, the situation is per se custodial.

My recollection was he was asked a compound question. But let's assume for purposes of the argument, he was not told that he didn't have to answer questions. I don't think under the circumstances here that would render the situation  custodial be given that he, the defendant freely have his own free will agree to accompany the detectives for an interview, and he conditioned his willingness to submit to an interview.  on their promise that he would be finished well in time to make his 1230 court hearing. So, so no reasonable person, having been told that could possibly think that the circumstances were tantamount to a formal arrest.  He accompanied the detectives. He wasn't searched, frisked, or handcuffed. He was treated like a witness, not an arrestee. Sure, the door here was closed to the interview room. But I would say that looking at the videotape, even just the clips that were admitted into evidence and not the entirety of the videotape, shows that that door was unlocked. The detectives both leave the room just by opening the door.  And this is at 321B, Exhibit 321B. This is after the DNA swab is taken. And they tell the defendant, they tell appellant, you're free to either stay and eat a sandwich or go. And then the second detective leaves. Well, obviously the only way the appellant can leave is if he can open the door and leave, just as the detectives have done. So the door was closed, but it wasn't locked.  And with respect to a couple of other points that the detectives were not controlling whether appellant could come or leave that room he didn't need to use the restroom he never asked to use the restroom he was offered that ability.  And again, the arguments that I'm hearing now about how the taking of the DNA, or the request at the very end of the interview that he remained for a few more minutes came well after the statements that appellant is seeking to suppress. So the conduct.  What happened at minute 44 or minute 110 or 111 can't, if that's what rendered the situation custodial, the statements were made, you know, at minute 20, you know, well before this other conduct that appellant is complaining about having rendered the situation custodial.",

That's what I meant in Graham, they were actually the questioning actually was accusatory they confronted Graham with evidence of his guilt.  And then he made admissions and they continued to interrogate him. Here, the detectives were very clear to say, your name just came up as someone we should talk to, we're investigating this murder. And what they said to him was, did you ever have sex with this woman? What would you say if it turns out, they gave him the impression that they didn't have DNA evidence at all.  and said, you know, we're now collecting DNA evidence, what would you say if it turns out your blood is on the scene? So this was certainly, if it was accusatory, it was quite gentle. The fact, if the court looks at this entire videotape, which is the government has submitted is not in evidence, was not in evidence, the motions court.  You'll see that for sure they were investigating this murder, also talking about a lot of other things, really developing the defense, the appellants recollection of that time period, what he was doing, trying to jog his memory about the specific time period.  They talked about his other, sort of his life. They talked about what a nice apartment he had. So this was not, this was, the only badgering case I found was Dorsey. And when the court reads the opinion in Dorsey, it's almost exhausting for the reader. The reader almost feels having been badgered. It really was just, it wiped me out. I can't tell you how it pains me to hear you say that.  But this case doesn't come anywhere close to that. And so- Could I just interrupt to ask a little clarification?",

He complained about it, but didn't offer a case or kind of a legal theory, a separate legal theory. And now I'm hearing him say that's just another factor as to custody.  Whatever it is, we don't think there was badgering here I think it's pretty clear if the court does go ahead and reviews the entire the entirety of the videotape, even though that was not an evidence before the motions court, the court will see that the, it was a, it was a cordial  courteous interview, at times the defendant appeared quite relaxed, at times he joked with the detectives, and so this does not approach, and the fact that he was, you know, these light gentle accusatory questions, what would you say if it turns out your blood is on the scene,  These circumstances in their totality, that's the detective's job. I mean, they're there to investigate the murder. He knows that they're investigating the murder. Those are the kind of questions that would ordinarily be asked when one is investigating this kind of murder.

The court found that he wasn't in custody.

I think under the government's theory, the detectives can take a defendant's DNA at the station house and engage in an hour and a half of closed door questioning and not have to advise the defendant of his Miranda rights.  And we would submit that as not the result this court should reach. It's in tension with Turner and also with Morton in terms of the nature of the questioning. And then the other point on Miranda is at 12 minutes in the video, Detective Williams says that they have information that he and Ms. McKinney may have come into contact with each other, may have known each other and may have at some point been involved with her murder.  And then after that, he's saying, we're looking for an explanation to what may have happened. And then at minute 14 is when they first raised taking his DNA. They raised it again at 32 minutes, or 33 minutes and 44 seconds. And then they ultimately take it after 40 minutes. And to quickly move on to harmless error, it's the government's burden to show that the un-Mirandi statements did not contribute to the verdict.  and that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There are three things I want to say as to why they cannot carry that burden. First, the government emphasized the statements in closing, and again in closing rebuttal, they ended their entire presentation by referencing the statements. Two, the way they used the statements was to suggest that Mr. General had no innocent explanation and left the jury with a highly prejudicial impression  that Mr. General was a liar and that helps fill the various gaps the government had in the case about how they came into contact. The fact that there's no eyewitness, it distracts from those questions and helps fill in the gaps and contributes to the verdict. And lastly, the government still relies on the statements at pages 49 and 50 of their brief as to why, uh, as to, to support the verdict. And so the government cannot carry their burden and we respectfully ask that this court reverse. Thank you.",

    "text": "Your Honors, there are three preliminary points I would like to make concerning the Fleming jury instruction issue. First, the government's brief on the Fleming issue concedes that the Fleming decision, which vacated a conviction for second-degree murder, applies to appellants' voluntary manslaughter convictions, in this case, where the same erroneous urban gun battle instruction was given.  Second, the government also concedes that if appellant's convictions for voluntary manslaughter are vacated, that their related convictions for possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, which are premised on their voluntary manslaughter convictions, must also be vacated.  And third, if this court vacates the appellant's convictions for voluntary manslaughter and for possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, then each of the three appellants has already completed serving their sentences and would be eligible for immediate release.  The court asked counsel to address whether appellants have waived the Fleming issue in this appeal. They have not. They raised a virtually identical challenge to the urban gun battle instruction when the case was tried before Judge Henry Green, and then in their first appeal, and then again immediately after the law changed with the Fleming en banc decision in this renewed appeal.  When the case was originally tried before Judge Green, counsel for appellant Parker, joined by counsel for the other co-appellants, objected to giving the urban gun battle instruction in language that mirrored what this court subsequently held in Fleming. Counsel stated that the instruction improperly, quote,  imports principles from negligence and tort law, reasonable foreseeability, substantial probability. Counsel for Mr. Parker made a similar objection to the preliminary instructions given by Judge Green, stating that the urban gun battle instruction improperly focused on, quote, substantial causation.  So these objections by counsel for Mr. Parker, which focused on the problem of guilt based upon substantial probability and substantial causation, mirror the holding in Fleming, which struck down the urban gun battle instruction because it allowed conviction if the defendant's conduct was a substantial factor in causing the death rather than a but-for factor.  And not only was this objection raised before Judge Green, but in their first appeal of this case, Mr. Fortson's brief at page 25 argued that the urban gun battle instruction, quote, permitted the jury to find Mr. Fortson guilty, even if they did not unanimously conclude that he was the actual cause of Mr. Buckner's death, as long as he actively participated in the gun battle, unquote.  Mr. Parker's brief. You've left out some language there.",

The paragraph then goes on to complain about aiding and abetting liability being attached. Now, aiding and abetting liability, you don't have causation issues at all. That's not the question.  Um, so I must tell you, I don't, I don't not read that portion of Mr. Forreston's brief or anything else set on appeal on direct appeal as preserving or as presenting the, but for causation, um, objection of funding.

If I will agree that if you preserve the issue on your direct appeal,  the plain error standard might apply because we could then treat this as if we were considering it on direct appeal. But you don't get the benefit of that unless you actually did raise it on direct appeal. And I'm asking you to assume  and discuss how we should proceed if we conclude that you didn't raise it on direct appeal. It's just like any other situation where we get an appeal from the 23-110 proceeding and the appellant seeks to raise a claim on that appeal that was not raised in the 23-110 proceeding in the trial court. We normally say we won't consider that, we won't hear that. You have to bring that claim.  Uh, you have to raise that claim in the first instance in your 23, 23, 1, 10 proceeding.

Why? Because it had already been decided in our view, and it was the law of the case. But everything changed radically on January 30th of this year,  when the Fleming en banc decision was handed down. And then this case was still pending on appeal. And within 11 days of the Fleming decision on February 11th, we filed a motion saying now that the law has changed in this jurisdiction, while this case is no longer final, language which is court has used in a prior case, Judge Glickman,  While even now that there's been a fundamental change here, the law in this jurisdiction which used to be Roy, and was the law of this case and we could be raised that, but until Fleming on bonk decision was handed down January 30 within 11 days.  We filed a motion with this court saying in this jurisdiction, the law has been changed. And this case is still not final. It's still pending on review, not as a collateral attack, but as a renewal, just like in the Davis, excuse me, in the Taylor case I cited a second time.  This case is coming back to this court. So it's proper for us to raise in this case now, once the law has changed, overruling the Roy decision, which was the law of the case when this second appeal was filed, that it was certainly proper for us, we believe.  in the context of this appeal to say, now that the law has changed, this case is not yet final.

It is a renewal of the consideration by this court of the principal issue raised in the first appeal after this Judge Green gave what the court asked for, a more complete record to enable this court to address it.

So I think this is most accurately characterized as the second time the same case has been before the court, just like the Taylor case that I referred to earlier, which, again, this court did not retain jurisdiction. A new notice of appeal had to be filed in Taylor. There was a new panel. But what's said, we remanded it to the judge to reconsider this issue. The judge has, and now we have it back a second time.  rather than a collateral attack. And it makes a big difference because it has to do with, especially, can the court consider it? And if it could consider it, which harmless error standards the court will apply.",

And again, we're conceding Judge Glickman, this whole Fleming issue was not a viable issue when we took the second appeal.  It had nothing to do with what Judge Green said. And the law was clear. It was the law of the case and the law in this jurisdiction. Roy was the law. So when we file this appeal, and for two years while the appeal was pending, there was no Fleming related issue. But while this appeal is pending,  when the en banc decision changes the law in this jurisdiction, well, then this court has often said, ah, there's a change in the law. We can and should apply it to this case. So that's why I didn't mean to, forgive me if I got overexcited, Judge Lick, but it said only the Fleming issue. Yes, when the appeal was taken and for two years thereafter, only the Fleming issue would be legitimately before this court, period.  But when the law changes, this court has often dealt with that situation. When a case is pending on appeal, the law changes.

Of course, as we say, that's not really the facts here, because it was properly raised, again, if not in exactly the same words, but lowering the standard of proof, focusing on the substantial factors.  So that would be my answer. I think it could be done, but we have, in this case, an even better record where a very similar argument to what the court decided in Fleming was raised. It was the urban gun battle instruction was challenged. It didn't come out of nowhere that we were challenging some other statutory crime on  It was the urban gun battle instruction with all counsel arguing that they have lowered the standard of proof. This, you know, it's improper instruction.

Therefore, it's not like this is coming out of the blue, but it was before this very similar objection was before this court the first time.

With respect to Mr. Parker, first of all, the government argues that there was, quote, compelling evidence that established that he fired the first shot. But the government's brief acknowledges that Sunita Raja was, quote, the only witness who saw Parker shooting and that, quote, it is highly improbable that the jury convicted Parker without crediting Raja's account. That's the government's brief.  But the government ignores the fact that Raja's 9-1-1 call made immediately after the shooting incident.

And then I also want to jump to if the court wants to hear it, the government's alternative theory of alternative, excuse me, of overwhelming evidence is that these appellants instigated the gun battle that resulted in Mr. Buckner's death. And again, if the court wants to hear this, again, I could just briefly say that there's two problems with this argument.  this instigation argument. First, I think that it is far too attenuated a theory to establish causation. But second, and even more important, the government concedes in its brief  that its instigation theory is totally dependent upon the testimony of one witness, Mr. Faison, who was the only witness who testified about this instigation theory. AUSA Jeff Perlman said this in his rebuttal argument to the jury. That's transcript 7212 at 119, which we cite in our applied brief.  The problem with this is that if this instigation theory, which the government concedes is totally dependent upon the testimony of Mr. Faison, both the government and Judge Green have stated that they did not believe that the jury found Mr. Faison's testimony to be credible.  The government's brief, which they filed April 26 of 2018 on page 38, states that the jury's verdicts in this case, quote, suggest they place little credence in Faison's testimony. And Judge Green reached the same conclusion. This court's decision in McRae specifically quoted Judge Green as saying, quote, that there were, quote, serious questions regarding his credibility  And Judge Greene added, which this court quotes in the McRae decision, 133A, second at 231, Judge Greene says he would be astounded, quote unquote, if the jury believed this testimony. So to the extent that the government's theory that they instigated this offense was totally based upon, as the government concedes, Mr. Faison's testimony, both the US Attorney's Office and Judge Greene have said the jury didn't buy it.  I think that the government's main theory with regarding prejudice goes back to the notion that the jury surely found that Parker initiated the shooting up at the circle and the liability of McCray and Fortson is really aiding and abetting liability, which is not affected by the error.  Sure, but again, again, and that was my argument earlier, your honor, that the argument that Mr. If we disregard the 911 call. Well, that's right.",

In just two minutes, Your Honors, the key point here is that the jury in this case was never apprised of a crucial basis of impeachment of Mr. Faison, that as a result of his diagnosed mental disability, he was so desperate to avoid further incarceration that he would do or say anything.  The government psychiatrist, Dr. Patterson, testified after interviewing him and reviewing his extensive medical records that he suffered from antisocial personality disorder, that he was suffering from this when he testified in this case. And Judge Henry Green adopted that testimony, which was also consistent with the defendant's expert, Dr. Remy Gupta, based upon not just a character flaw, but based upon the two psychiatrists  diagnosis of a mental disorder within the context of the DSM, the American Psychiatric Association's Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.

Because if you have a witness who swears to tell the truth,  in front of the jury, that's supposed to have some weight with a jury, right? But if you tell, if you're able to reveal to the jury or discuss in front of the jury that this particular witness has been diagnosed with a condition that basically says that, you know, he doesn't take oaths seriously. He doesn't feel bound by them. He doesn't care. He is willing to come here and lie.  It's not just that he lied at one point before. It's not just that it would be to his benefit. It's that this guy has really no regard for the oath. That's how I read some of the discussion about what this ASPD diagnosis mean. And I was wondering whether it's not analogous to the cases where we've talked about corruption bias and how that is a kind of bias  that is different from self-interest, for example. The fact that somebody is willing to lie in court because they just can disregard the obligation or the oath to tell the truth, even as very serious matters, is something of independent,  significance to the question of the trial of the jury's assessment of credibility. Do you see a connection there? Because I've been trying to, in my own mind, understand to what aspect of credibility this diagnosis goes.",

    "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. David Sable on behalf of the United States, may it please the court. A couple small points, Your Honor. Chief Judge, you asked a question about why Fortson was part of this appeal. The court remanded the case for McCrae and for Parker, but not for Fortson.  The government did not oppose Mr Fortson joining at the evidentiary hearing so there wasn't a need for a rule and we just said it was okay if you wanted to join because he hadn't raised the mental health issue previously. Turning to the procedural posture with Fleming.  We think that Judge Glickman has it exactly right. This is, there is a remedy for appellants here and that is a collateral attack, which is, and they would need to satisfy the Boozley standard. It's not appropriate of course for this court.  to do the Boosley analysis because Boosley envisions that, of course, the question is raised collaterally. The trial court makes a determination about cause and prejudice and actual innocence and then the appeal is taken from that.  The question is, perhaps it's difficult to state exactly what the status of this appeal is. There is a second appeal, the first appeal that mandate issued the certificate of the petitions for cert were denied. The case was remanded, not the record.  And the issue that appellants now are seeking to raise the Fleming issue is far afield from the initial from the issues that were remanded. Moreover, we would make the argument that of course this could have been raised initially on the basis of barrage and of course.  Chief Judge and Lucas, recently a Fleming opinion that you wrote, you talked about how Fleming adopted the framework of barrage. So that raises the question of a second remedy for appellants, which would be to move to withdraw the mandate and file an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim for failing to raise this kind of claim in the first appeal.  Of course, to judge Reese's question about could they have raised this in the first appeal. We know that it does happen typically that arguments like this are raised where appellants might say well barrage undermine the basis that for Roy and we want to take that up with the panel and perhaps the panel would then have.  signal their willingness to go on bonk with the issue, which is essentially what happened with with Fleming, of course, and the government in Fleming, that was the argument and Fleming, that was the outcome. But here, the case has been remanded, and we're on an unrelated issue, which is the mental health impeachment issue. We're not on any other issues. And so to raise Fleming now,  The issue would be waived under the court's jurisprudential decisions talking about an issue could be raised initially, but also because the remedy is the collateral attack. Court's brief indulgence.  With respect to whether the issue was raised, I'll just say briefly, Judge Glickman, you asked about what does close enough mean? Well, this court has said close enough means an issue is raised with reasonable specificity, enough to alert the trial court to the existence of the claim.  Judge Green never discerned that kind of claim being raised. I know I briefed this case on the direct appeal. I didn't perceive it. And on the argument with the initial panel on which you sat, Judge Glickman, and the decision that was written by Judge Reed, that issue was never discerned. So if it was raised, everybody missed it. And so I think that doesn't satisfy the Hunter standard.  Turning to the merits of the prejudice argument for Fleming, if I may, just briefly, the government set out three different theories under which the  the instructional error, which is now playing on appeal, would be harmless. I want to say something first, if I can, about the standard to be applied here. This court recently in Malloy talked about, which I think was an Alanis case, talked about  plain air review for instructional error and said that appellant has to establish a reasonable probability that but for the air, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. And then of course it went on to talk about what that means, not a probability but simply a.  that the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence in the outcome. That's the standard that appellant would have to surmount here if this court addressed the Fleming issue on the merits. And what's clear from that language is that what the court is called upon to inquire is, had the jury been instructed properly  Is there a reasonable probability that, but for the error, the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt? It's not, had there been, if there were a different trial and everybody got to introduce different evidence, what exactly would be the outcome of that trial? And that's relevant to Mr. Meyer's 911 call argument, because I think Judge Glickman was asking him about that. The 911 call is not going to be part of the Fleming analysis. It can't be part of the Fleming analysis.  because the question is, had the jury been properly instructed? I do want to say something about, so the 911 call then is pertinent, is not pertinent, but even if it were, it would not be, it would not affect the materiality because what Raja said on her 911 call was,  She looked down off her balcony, she saw Buckner on the ground and she said, and the 911 operator asked her, did you see who shot Buckner? Did you see who shot him? And she said, no. And so she testified at trial that she observed the Avenue crew member Weedy shoot Buckner.  Buckner and appellants asked the jury to credit that statement because they wanted the evidence to be that, of course, that Avenue killed Buckner. But it was the statement was not material. She didn't say she didn't see any shooting. She said she didn't see who shot Buckner. But talking about that first theory of of harmlessness here,  The evidence was long and involved, but there were essentially three eyewitnesses who saw this shooting in the circle. There was Shanita Roger on her, on her neighbor's balcony looking down from apartment building 610 and she saw Parker shooting.  And then there were two other witnesses in a different location, a cooperating witness, Jovan Clay, and another witness who wasn't a cooperator but was a crew member named Angela Wages, and they saw Fortson and McCray shooting.  So the only witness who could say that I saw Parker shooting, the only witness that could form the basis for a voluntary manslaughter while armed conviction was Shanita Rogers. There were some ear witness statements, of course, but I think it's highly unlikely that those would have formed the basis for a conviction here. So the jury had to have credited Shanita Rogers. And although she was impeached in many different ways, it's obvious from the verdict that they credited her.  And what she said was, she heard the shots from the back of the apartment building, which was McCray doing the first court shooting. She went out on the balcony and she saw Parker walking across the courtyard with a rag over a gun. He posts up in front of her building. She sees Avenue crew member Weedy come through the gap between the two buildings and she sees Parker fire first.  She was very clear. She saw Parker fire first. Then he racks the slide as if he has a jam. We know that's true because the firearms examiner described the light. Does she also say she saw Weedy fire the fatal shot?",

And then he comes back out, he starts firing again at Weedy, and then everybody starts firing. After everybody starts firing, Buckner runs across the courtyard towards Parker,  According to Raja, Weedy fires a shot, Buckner takes a bullet in the side of the head and collapses. And Raja says that Weedy then fired the shot that killed Buckner. By that time, of course, everybody was firing. That means Parker had been firing the first shot, and then McCrae and Fortson had also been firing his aiders and abettors. On the strength of that testimony, which we know was credited by the jury, the but-for causation, which  in Lucas, you said was not owner standard, is satisfied.

    "text": " Mr. Sebald, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think my understanding had been that the person who, that the way the but for causation theory would work in this instance is that the person who by firing first sets the match as it were, and triggers beyond the gun battle in which somebody is shot.  has caused that gun battle to occur and is the but-for cause of the person's death, whether that person who fired first was themself shooting at the particular victim or in fact hit the particular victim. It's the triggering effect that can support the but-for causation. Now, I do have a question about that for you.  But that's been my understanding of why focusing on the person who fired first makes sense from the point of view of but-for causation. Now, one question I do have about Fleming that bears on that. There is language in Fleming, and I'm not going to try to give you the page because I don't have it in front of me. But there is language in Fleming  which suggests that if one could say that, well, even if that person had not even been there, that's not right. Even if that, well, even if that person had, I didn't say that right. Even if that person had not fired a gun at all. No, let me put it a little bit differently to make it a little clearer.  even if that person had been the person who was a but for, but for, um, or I'm having trouble articulating this, but the notion I think is if regardless of that person's actions, other persons, other, um, people involved in the shooting would have fired anyway. And one of them would have killed the person then.  That raises the question about whether the first person that we talked about was a but-for causation, that would eliminate but-for causation. It strikes me as an odd thing for the opinion to have said, if I've understood it correctly, because I think you can, there are cases in which, what that would lead to is saying nobody is a but-for cause of the death.  But I wonder if you would comment on that because that's a feature of the Fleming opinion that I realized I found somewhat confusing to me.",

    "text": " I think the court is saying, I recall Fleming raising a lot of situations that were not exactly presented by the case. And it was a, it was a fairly wide ranging opinion which my judge would not have liked.  And they tried to address a lot of different scenarios and give guidance to the trial court, obviously. But not all scenarios were resolved. I think there was one scenario we talked about, two people both firing and their bullets both kill somebody. Are they both but for causes when you know that even if you take one of them out of the equation, the other one would have shot anyway. And I think the court might have punted on that. It's a barrier on that, right. That's like a law school hypothetical.  That's right, but we do know that we know from Fleming that there's various ways of lighting the match. And another way that Fleming talked about was if I bring an armed group of search of somebody and we're going to search for someone and that person happens to fire first at us and then we fire back and somebody's killed in the hail of bullets. Well, we're still but for causes because we brought that armed group to you.  And so this this way of provoking a fight of being a but for cause of a fight is analogous to the inquiry that a jury's and called upon to decide in self defense. And that was the case here the judge instructed the jury look.  If you find that appellants were the first aggressor or otherwise provoked this or brought this upon themselves, then you cannot find that they acted in self defense and we know the jury found that they did not in fact act on self defense and here.  So that means the jury found that they were the aggressors or that they provoked this fight upon themselves. Not in exactly the same as the but force causation, but it's getting there. The two concepts are certainly related. And so we're saying that they are but for causes because Parker fired first and the others aided and abetted, or because they took such provocative actions that they were but for causes.  And so I can talk just briefly about what those actions were and they don't rely on the testimony of Curtis Bayes on necessarily what we know is that.  McRae, Hebron, and Mungo went over to First Court, fired bullets at the Avenue members. McRae was convicted of that. The bullets were heard in the courtyard. They come running back. They go inside, rearm themselves, including their extended clip holding 30 bullets, and post up, armed at one location,  Parker gets his gun from under some stairs, walks across the courtyard, shuns people from the barbecue inside, takes up an armed position in front of 610, and then Fortson and Henson get a gun and they guard the third way of entering the fortress. So there's three ways to enter the fortress that is the circle. And groups of men from the circle stand at each location armed.  brandishing weapons, waiting for the Avenue guys to come through, which they do in five to 10 minutes. And in fact, we have testimony to McCrae is plotting. He's pointing his gun at people coming through the cut. And so those actions are very provocative. They brought that fight upon themselves. We also know that they did that in the context of McCrae going over there and starting things first. They knew that the Avenue members were going to come back. And  The third argument I would say to your honor is that it's possible.  The court may or may not want to do this, but it's possible to view the two shootings as one continuous event. And I know Judge Glickman, in your concurrence and dissent, and Roy, you expressed concern about a temporal hiatus between the two shootings as necessarily being a concern for cause and fact. But under these facts, we view these two shootings as one continuous event. The match was set.  when McCrae went over there to start things, or as Faison said, to go start the fight so that they would come over and the circle could box them in and end the beef right there. And if the two events are viewed as one, then they certainly lit the match by going over to first court and starting the shooting there. So those are the three different ways that we see that the Fleming actual cause standard is met here.",

    "text": " We cited some cases where this court has done that. For example, in Wilson Bay, I think it did that. In some of these other cases, the court, the evidence was such, the facts were such that the court said the instructional error did not affect. I mean, the evidence in Wilson Bay was quite different from the evidence here, no? Well, there are not tons of data points for this kind of analysis. It's a little bit of a... I'm turning to the...  There's the Wilson Bay, and then we also had, there's the Williamson case, the Perez case, and Wilson Bay, and actually Alanis itself. And this is on pages 42 to 43 of the government's brief in this matter.  So those that I tried to look at those and say, this is the analysis that the court should engage in and to be careful about that. Obviously, the court's not weighing all the evidence itself. I don't think the court's looking at the way the jury weighed the evidence. If there are no further questions, I would turn to the  turn briefly to the mental health impeachment question. With respect to Curtis Faison's testimony, Curtis Faison was a defendant in this case. He was charged with murder.  He was not present for the shooting where Antoine Buckner was killed, but he essentially decided to plead guilty in the middle of the trial. He pled guilty in the middle of the trial and then decided to testify for the government. And so it was a situation where everybody was scrambling to do the best that they could at the time. And the question of course arose, well, they obtained his mental health records from  the jail and looked at them and whether or not they were entitled to an expert. And there was some evidence in these mental health records about some things that went to bipolar disorder from 2004. And this court decided that the trial court should have had an evidentiary hearing to see what that meant and whether they were entitled to a mental health, an expert to testify who could have impeached Curtis Faison.  It's important to remember that Faison was impeached on many different respects. He malingered at the jail, lied about different things in order to go to segregation or to get medical treatment. He had obstructed justice. He had committed murder. He obviously said something. He said he didn't know somebody on the stand on cross-examination and admitted knowing them on redirect. He was extensively impeached with a lot of prior instances of not being truthful.  And when Dr. Patterson, who was the government expert, looked at that, he said, well, he said a couple things. First of all, he said there's no evidence that he was asymptomatic at the time of the trial.  But and so the the bipolar issue went by the board very quickly. But he said, you know, he does have a pattern of line. He has this pattern of line. So I would say he has not a disability, not an illness, but he has a disorder where one of the features is that he has a pattern of line.  And this did not, and Judge Blackburn-Rigsby, you asked this question. He said, this does not impact Faison's credibility. Not just that he did not significantly impact it, he said it did not impact his credibility. And the court credited Dr. Patterson, did not credit the defense expert, and found that the standard on remand had not been met.  Mr. Sable, just to clarify, did you understand the trial court's ruling to be that his illness, Mr. Faison's mental condition did not seriously impact his ability and or willingness?",

    "text": "Right.  The question is, when can expert testimony be used to impeach the credibility of a witness? And in all the cases that this court, I believe, have ever addressed, and almost any court has ever addressed, that goes to the ability or capacity of a witness to testify. That is their ability to perceive, recall, and relate.  So somebody who has delusions around the time of when they perceive recalled or related. So the incident, the grand jury, or the trial, about two years within. Anytime somebody has got those, that's going to be the subject of possible impeachment. Assuming, of course, you can satisfy the 403 issues, which are confusion of the jury, a trial within a trial, and the invasion of the witness's privacy. So it needs to be very relevant. That's what this court has said.  We're in a completely different area now because this did not have anything to do with Faison's ability to tell the truth. This had to do only with his willingness to tell the truth. And so I have not found any cases anywhere in this country where a court permitted mental health impeachment by an expert on this basis of  and a diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder. It comes in in death penalty cases in the sentencing phase, but I had never found it in a trial. The only case where anybody seems to think that this similar testimony came in was the Alger Hiss case. And there's just where the person had, it's not clear exactly what happened, but that seems to be an outlier from a district court in New York.  In McRae, Judge Reeds mentioned a case called Baxter in the circuit that talked about ability and willingness to testify and credibility. But the marking orders that the panel gave to Judge Green was to determine at a hearing whether at the time of this trial testimony, Mr. Faison's mental disabilities  seriously impacted his credibility. So it was a two-part, and then to go on and address prejudice. And Judge Green didn't address prejudice because he felt that the first part wasn't satisfying. So the two-part test here was, does Mr. Faison have a mental disability  And then if he did, did it seriously impact his credibility? And the judge said no on both fronts. And the expert said no on both fronts. And I think this was actually a very smart formulation because it embraced the two concepts that all the opinions I've read talk about. First of all, it has to be a mental disability. It has to be a condition that impairs the witnesses  willingness to tell the truth. And secondly, it has to seriously impact his credibility in order to surmount the 403 concerns. All the opinions talk about impairment. For example, we know there are cases where somebody has compulsive lying, where they are unable to control their lying.  So somebody who sees a crime in the paper and goes down to the police station and falsely confesses to it, the jury needs to hear from an expert just to see why somebody would falsely confess to a crime they did not commit. There are other cases where, and so that's an example of where somebody has an impairment. And this is why Dr. Patterson talked about disabilities and mental illnesses as,  conditions that the victim does not control, you don't control whether you have a disability or an illness, you suffer from them, and they don't control that. What Curtis Faison had was a disorder where he controlled his lying. He lied a lot, but he controls his lying.  The reason I believe that courts require a pronounced disposition to lie or an impairment or a situation where the witness is unable to control it is because we know that juries, and this, Judge Ruiz, I think this gets to the concern that you were expressing. We know that juries can assess credibility. We know that juries can assess when somebody lies because they're selfish. Juries can assess when somebody lies because they're narcissistic or they have a bias or a motive.  Juries need help from an expert when someone lies because there's some sort of medical phenomenon going on that affects what the witness is able to do. So that would be schizophrenia, for example, or that would be this kind of compulsive lying that a witness has no control over. And what Judge, what Dr. Patterson emphasized over and over again is,  Faison lies, but he is able to control his lying. I can't tell you whether he's lying at trial. I can't tell you whether he's going to lie in any particular incidents. What I can tell you is he can control it. And we also know the jury heard about the many instances in which Faison lied. Dr. Patterson, he's not a human lie detector. He didn't sit and talk to Faison and say, oh, well, I can tell you're lying. He just looked at the same record of lying that the jury looked at, and he put this label on it.  The courts that the opinions don't permit that kind of label would not have helped the jury, it would not have helped the jury at all because they jury was capable of making this determination.  That's why, I mean, I don't know, that's why I think the panel decision got it right when it remanded with this language. Maybe the word disability needs some clarification, but we know that it needs to be an impairment, and we know that it needs to be something that seriously impacts the credibility, or in this case, the willingness to tell the truth. And antisocial personality disorder  does not meet that criteria. It certainly didn't meet it in Faison's case. And the only expert testimony we have that was credited by Judge Green is Dr. Patterson's testimony who said that this did not affect Faison's willingness to tell the truth.",

The expert is giving testimony. And the question is whether that is testimony that would be helpful to the jury, to the fact finder.  which has the role of assessing credibility in making that assessment. And if a doctor can explain to a jury how somebody would just lie because they have really no regard for the obligation to tell the truth, they can just lie. It's not that they're compelled to lie. It's that they don't care.  that you should not put any stock on the fact that they have gotten on that witness stand and sworn to tell the truth. Why is that not a relevant consideration for a jury? Now, the argument can be made on the other side. That doesn't mean he always lies, right? And then you might point to other evidence that corroborates what the person has said.  But isn't I just found that I understand that this court mentioned mental illness or disability in the remand order, but that really those it is, in fact, what you said was a condition, something that was probative of the witnesses credibility. Of the trust that anybody should put in that person and what that person says,  that actually has a medical diagnosis and is recognized and where both doctors agreed that this witness showed, I think it was six out of the seven characteristics of people with that personality, a recognized personality disorder, which goes to truth-telling or rather not truth-telling.",

It would have usurped their role. These kinds of determinations are the kinds of determinations that are within their ken. And that's why he didn't have  the kind of impairment that an expert needed to explain to the jury and it didn't seriously impact his testimony. And so that's why we would urge the court to affirm on that ground as well.",

    "text": " Thank you, Your Honor, and I don't think I'm going to need even that much time. I appreciate all the attention the court's paid to it, and I'd like to make three very brief points. First, that Mr. Sable referred at length to the circumstances involving the shooting, but I would ask this court to take a look at the reply briefs which the appellants filed, which documented that there was a lot of  inconsistency and confusion about what the circumstances actually are. Second, Mr. Sable referred to the case he brought to this court's attention yesterday, in which the court said that testimony about antisocial personality disorder was inadmissible, but  This case strongly supports the appellant's point of view because the court held in that case that such psychiatric testimony and the medical records supporting it could be introduced if there were, quote, compelling reasons for it.  And we've argued that there were compelling reasons in this case. And the final brief point I'd like to make is response to the Burrage argument that Mr. Sable made, that the government says that we waived the Fleming issue because it was readily foreseeable that Roy no longer was good law in light of the Burrage case.  And I'm not going to repeat the argument I made before that I do not think we waived it that with that council are repeatedly made very similar arguments to the on reasonable probability that was adopted in Roy, but even if it didn't.  there's a problem with this government's waiver argument that it was readily foreseeable. Because the government relies upon, to make this argument, Judge Easterly's concurring opinion for the three-judge panel in Fleming, in which he cites Burgess. But the point is, there were two other judges on the panel, including a judge who's sitting on this panel, who didn't agree with, who didn't go along with that concurrence.  And in addition, the government ignores the fact that in 2016, more than two and a half years after Burridge was decided, this court decided Bryant. And that's one forty eight, a third, six eighty nine, in which this court extended the Roy analysis.  to first degree murder without considering the Burrage case. And again, another member of this panel sat on the Bryant court. So there's two out of the three members of this panel itself who dealt with this issue without expressing that it was readily apparent that Burrage had overruled Roy.  I would appreciate the court's long consideration of this oral argument. And I thank the court for its consideration. And that's all I have to say today. Thank you.",
