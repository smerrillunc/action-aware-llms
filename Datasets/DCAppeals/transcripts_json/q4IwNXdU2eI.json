    "text": "Yes, Your Honor. Good morning, Monica Milton on behalf of Mr. Charmante Walker, the appellant in this case. I would like to reserve two minutes for rebuttal. Okay. Judge, Your Honors, counsel, may it please the court.  Mr. Walker asked this court to reverse his convictions because Strickland and Brady violations unconstitutionally hampered his ability to prove his innocent or amount any defense. The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees every criminal defendant adequate and effective representation. The only defense Mr. Walker had against the ample power of the United States government would have been effective trial counsel.  Strickland versus Washington directs courts to analyze this under two prongs to determine whether counsel's assistance was ineffective. And that's whether the performance was sufficient. And Mr. Walker must show that that deficient performance prejudice the defense. With respect to performance, he has the burden to show that counsel's representation fell below objective and standard of reasonableness.  Mr. Attorney Jeffrey Lewis failed to make proper pre trial investigations failed to interview exculpatory witnesses and failed to present any evidence for the defense in that constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel.  The record indicates that Mr. Walker first alerted the court to Jeffrey Lewis's deficient performance three months before trial. And he stated that his attorney was not investigating. He was not filing pre-trial motions. And Mr. Walker was fearful that his attorney was not adequately prepared. And that bore out because Mr. Lewis did not present a defense for Mr. Walker.",

Now,  Mr. Lewis was at least in possession of a Brady disclosure that indicated there was an eyewitness who said he heard and saw an argument between Mr. Carraway and the decedent before the shooting. And both Mr. Harn, the co-counsel appointed, or rather relatedly, but appointed before two weeks before trial, stated that they would have liked to have interviewed this person.

Just because there is an argument facing each other doesn't mean that the decedent didn't turn around if he observed a gun, that he could have turned around. He could have moved, maybe seeing the gun. So I don't think that there's evidence that  Just because there was an argument that was face to face, it means that that necessarily means he was shot face to face, he could have turned around to flee if he exerted a gun, he could have been.  alerted to that and turning around. So I don't think that that's inconsistent with the idea that they were in an argument, but it does go to the issue as to whether or not this was premeditated. And although the government asserts that there was an ample amount of evidence, I'm sure the court was able to view the video. The video really, there's no sound.  The video doesn't really indicate anything in terms of the context of this shooting, other than I don't think that that's an issue with that issue is whether or not there was an argument, whether or not that precipitated the shooting or whether there was before the shooting, there was an agreement because this Mr. Walker is convicted under an 80 and abetted abetting theory.  And although the trial judge said that there was ample amount of evidence, there's ample amount of evidence that Mr. Carraway shot Mr. Hendy, and we all agree with that. But we don't agree with whether or not there was an agreement beforehand. We don't have any disinterested witnesses testifying. Mr. Lewis does not want to examine Janetta Sapp, who's the property manager who claims to have identified Mr. Walker on this video.  makes no effort to cross-examine despite the graininess and lack of sound in the video.

It's just a matter of whether or not that this argument happened and the attorney says,  That went against what we knew to be the case, but that's the point. The only thing they had to go on was the government's proper and theory. So if there was an inconsistent eyewitness who could testify to something that was in conflict with the government's case, then it's constitutionally ineffective for one, that he did not go and try to seek out that witness. And secondly, that he would not have presented this disinterested witnesses testimony.  Despite the fact that the trial court believed that this was a strong case, it was a strong case to the extent that they were able to prove Mr. Carraway shot Mr. Hendy. The agreement was not a strong case. They had his ex-girlfriend testifying who benefited through government resources for relocation money. There was really no one that the government presented  that had personal knowledge of this case, that was stronger than this interested witness who witnessed, he's the only one that witnessed the shooting with his own eyes and heard and was able to identify.",

Mr. Frederick Thompson came about because he, I think he knew property manager, Shanetta Sapp, and he directly reached out to the police to tell them what he saw. If there was such an issue with credibility and what was going on and what he would testify to, I just wonder why the government would have asked for a grand jury testimony from him.  And, and furthermore, I'm attorney horn when he joins the defense team says he's disappointed with the state of the affairs he's disappointed that there wasn't more investigation.  If he had joined earlier, he would have investigated more. So I think that at least to the extent that there was a claim that there was a failure to investigate, even co-counsel agreed with Mr. Walker, who agreed that there was an insufficient investigation.

And there are a lot of other witnesses who gave testimony about an altercation and the inconsistencies in their testimony were exposed. One of the witnesses even conceded that he didn't hear an argument. Some didn't hear arguments, et cetera, et cetera.  How would this case go forward on the theory that that you're thinking that the defense would have been able to develop with Mr Thompson's testimony because there is still the plea colloquy with Mr Caraway.  The government still has that. There was still the testimony of the other witnesses involved. How would that play out?

This disinterested witness testifying to what he saw, that there was an argument, that this was a spontaneous shooting as opposed to all of these other factors. Mr. Carraway seeking a beneficial sentence, plain guilty. Mr. Buchanan testifying, also another interested witness and was threatened by the government with prosecution.

If we if for our purposes, if we assume that the the video that should have come in was in exhibit six and eight,  Because the raw footage, I think the testimony was there were 32 cameras right inside and outside, and each camera has hours of footage on it. And the relevant.  I mean, the incident lasts about two minutes. So if we assume that it is cut down to size in Exhibits 6 and 8 and played during Detective Olzak's testimony, that's one issue, and I'd like to talk about that in a minute.  But investigator Volpe takes the stand. The video is not played. No video was played during his testimony. And so I'm trying to understand what the problem is with his testimony vis-a-vis the video. He is not narrating or interpreting the video because the video was not played while he's on the stand. Am I missing something?",

It sounds like he's starting to possibly say what he set saw in the video in some detail. And, and there's an objection and he gets cut off and the court, it seems rightly says, you can't.  go through blow by blow and say what you saw in the video that by the way no one has seen yet right has not been put into evidence and so it seems like the court actually correctly and there's a conversation about like what was the government trying to do and the government says oh actually i'm just trying to elicit what um the the putative  victim of the robbery was wearing and the court is like, okay, you can do that, but you can't do anything else. And then the government does only that and elicits what the putative victim was wearing and then establishes that the police saw that person wearing that outfit out on the street. So that doesn't seem problematic either.

That's the crucial, do those interactions constitute a robbery? And without the testimony of Olsak and Volpe too, I don't think you can make that out.

Even with the testimony they heard, the government's argument was that, yeah, here it is right there on the video, and the detectives told you. It's just exactly like the detectives told you.

We do have cases saying that giving the Winters instruction after a jury poll is conducted could be considered coercive to the jury. But I'm not familiar with any cases where we felt that giving the Crowder instruction  following a jury poll is inherently coercive. I mean, I think we generally think of the Crowder instruction as perhaps not as strong or forceful as a Winters instruction. Do you have any cases to the contrary?

Well, no, but here's why I think it is coercive, because a couple of reasons. Number one, the winner's instruction is the high water mark.  All right. So that, you know, giving the second anti-deadlock charge after the jury is told once, you know, we really would like to reach a verdict there. And they came out and incorrectly notified the court that they had reached a unanimous verdict. That was incorrect. They had not reached a unanimous verdict.  and then the court gives them another instruction, and in all probability, it was one juror. I mean, we don't know that for sure, but generally speaking, I've never sat on a jury, but if there is one holdout, I think just the dynamic, maybe there's one juror who just has a second thought when the poll is given, or maybe didn't articulate that juror's dissent clearly enough,  and the poor person thought they had a verdict. So you could see where, or maybe the juror just changed their mind when they walked in the courtroom or whatever. A poll breakdown suggests that there is only one, because if there's more than one, the probability that one juror didn't articulate their dissent clearly enough thereby  suggesting to the foreperson that they reached the unanimous verdict when they had not, the probability of those kinds of things happening is diminished. And I guess it's probably diminished by an exponential factor.  So I think that in all probabilities, one juror, and then the judge is instructed. Of course, this juror- But I'm not sure that there's a basis to assume that.",

    "text": " But it is no different than if 15 still photographs or 15 clips or 15 autopsy photos, the selection of photos is not in and of itself a testimonial statement. Now, you asked me about case law. This court has the Bryant case where three surveillance videos were put together to be played and they were at the same time.  which is different. We have them here one after the other. And so the assertion was, well, the assertion of synchronicity was in itself a statement. And the court said, found no plain error there because the videos were authenticated. And there was a witness who said, didn't testify about the videos, but testified to the way the events  proceeded. So we don't have, an appellant has never articulated any way in which this compilation somehow represents a statement by anybody. The second case I would call court's attention to is the Cloutier case out of the 11th circuit. It was a subject of a 28k letter filed yesterday, where the court said the selection of government exhibits doesn't constitute a statement within the meaning of the confrontation clause.  And so that's our reasoning. We also know, I mean, you're a former trial judge, Your Honor, you know government defense. We select exhibits all the time. Those decisions that we make about this presentation of evidence are not statements. We're trying to tell a story. We're trying to convince the jury of a narrative, and we're asking them to draw inferences from the evidence, but we aren't making statements ourselves. We are simply presenting the evidence.  And so whether it's a crime scene diagram, or the selection of crime scene photographs, or the selection of autopsy photographs, or a clip from a video, we're not making statements. We're simply selecting what we think is the most relevant evidence. But our selection of what we think is relevant, again, isn't a statement as to relevance. We're just asking the jury to draw an inference. And it's tested by the adversarial process, which is why the court doesn't need to be concerned about  fairness or misleading because we all have the same evidence at trial and to the extent the defense thinks that something's misleading well they have the rule of completeness and the prosecutor is going to look silly if we leave out a photo that says something important or a clip in this case that says something important about the robbery.  So, can I ask a quick question though separate from confrontation, there is the issue of authentication.",

They seem to be a separate thing, as you point out, right? Like, I mean, the government is always making statements. The government is an advocate making its case for the people saying, we think this crime happened and that this person is responsible and should be held to account, right? That's their statement.  But on the issue of authentication, I thought the government's better argument was there was authentication. This is a new video. I mean, I take your point that they could have been played seriatim, but they weren't. The government selected a minute and a half of each video and strung them together. And there could have been an argument that you cut off too soon or you left something out.  And so the government did put in witnesses, albeit in this very strange order, to authenticate to say these videos that I've seen that the fact finder you haven't seen yet are authentic. We didn't leave anything out. It looks the way that I remember seeing it on the day after the incident. So I thought that the government's argument would be, not only is this not a confrontation clause violation,  But we did authenticate, you know, or you can't show any harm from any deficiency of authentication. You know, we put in enough and there's really no concern here and they haven't shown anything that's missing. Do you disagree with that?",

They're basically saying there is no statement that implicates the confrontation clause and the admission of the videos isn't a problem because they were authentic.  What we have are a custodian of the melon market came in and said, I came in at eight o'clock in the morning or seven o'clock in the morning. The videos are stored in a basement office that only me and my wife have access to. There was, I checked the timestamps, they were fine. The videos hadn't been toyed with. And so I'm authentic, you know, that's my knowledge and this is the video and these, you know,  He said, I authenticated the videos in that way. And then we had the MPD custodian come in. We know it's well-established. This is sufficient authentication. So these video clips are authenticated. And so there isn't an issue with the run-of-the-mill evidentiary introduction of these. And just to complete my response, Your Honor, the confrontation  clause isn't implicated by the presentation of these clips. And even if it were, again, of course, it's harmless because we have no reason, there's no argument, no presentation, no proffer, that there was anything that was received that was prejudicial.

Right.  Right. You know, it's just, it's, it's a lot going on and they end up deliberating for as long as they heard evidence for, it's not a long trial.

    "text": " They deliberate for a little over a day, Your Honor. The court made specific findings that the court did not know the split, that there was no impasse, that they were not deadlocked, but that the parties just wanted to go home by the end of the day. And that's when she gave the full Crowder instruction the next morning. I would submit to you that this was less coercive in a situation like Coley, for example.  And in Coley, we know that the dissenting juror sent several notes, and from the nature of the note, the court found, this court found, that the dissenter was identified, the dissenter was isolated and perceived herself as isolated, and the court gave only the first  The paragraph of the crowd instruction this and this, this court said, if you've given the full Crowder instruction that would have alleviated the potential for coercion, but the court didn't do that. And that was the case where the dissenter was identified and isolated and here that's simply not the case.  because of the earliness of the poll breakdown and because of specific findings made by Judge Knowles. Those are the kinds of facts that would give this court confidence that the jury was not unduly coerced. To find otherwise, Your Honor, this court would essentially be finding that anytime there's a poll breakdown after a winter's instruction, the court must declare a mistrial because the other factors here were all pointing in the direction of less coercion and not more.",

The video was the most important part, but we also had the still photographs which captured the key moments from the video that were not contested. We had the recovery of the matching clothing and the paintball box from the search warrant. And also we had the defendant's statements in the jail call that he was on the scene. So on the strength of all that evidence, we would submit that any error would have been harmless.  Thank you, and we'd ask that the judgment is superior court.",

    "text": "Yeah, a couple of things. First of all, on the jury coercion issue, the way in which the jury returned the verdict is evidence of coercion. The original verdict that the foreperson, that turned out to be not a verdict,  The original verdict was guilty of armed robbery, right? The juror number two dissented on that. They came back and they were told again that it's, you know, we're trying to reach verdict here, okay? And then they come back with a verdict of unarmed robbery, which was irrational. Because if there was a robbery here,  the force or the threat of force would have been the use of the gun. Yet the jury found him un acquitted him of the armed element of the offense. So the juries are allowed to compromise to issue compromised verdicts. But the fact that it is a compromised verdict, just because that per se is allowable,  does not necessarily mean that the irrational verdict is not evidence of jury coercion. The jury was coerced in the verdict because there was at least one juror who disagreed with the armed robbery. They then went and delivered a verdict that was unarmed robbery, but the only  the only logical force was with the use of a gun. So that would have been, if the jury was uncoerced, they would have either found him not guilty of everything or guilty of the armed robbery. So I didn't say that as clearly as I'd like to, but the irrationality of the verdict  is evidence that the jury was compromised they they figured the judge wants us to the judge wants us to get a verdict so let's just do this uh another point um with respect to what mr sebold said about  Volpe's narration and Olsak's narration of the video was to show why they seized the clothes in the course of their investigation. Assuming arguendo that that's valid, because that's certainly not what the government said to the jury, but assuming arguendo that's valid, the prejudicial effect of that testimony  far outweighs any possible probative value. The probative value of that testimony is minimal, just about non-existent, but it is highly prejudicial because the witness is saying not only that a robbery occurred, but that these different facts that I'm seeing on the video, those facts constitute a robbery. It wasn't just his opinion that a robbery occurred,  It is, you know, these people come up, one of them's got a gun, and then they talk, and then there's a dropping of the bag, and then they picked up the bag, and then they ran out of the store. All those things, even without opining that that's a robbery, those things that the detective said constitute a robbery. So that's really the prejudice. It's not just them saying, oh, that's a robbery, and then the jury is told it's up for them to determine if it's a robbery.  So, and then with respect to what the government says about it not being a statement, it is a statement. It's a statement that a robbery occurred. If there was no statement that a robbery occurred in this case, the government doesn't survive a judgment of acquittal. So unless there's any further questions, I will submit on what I have already said.",
