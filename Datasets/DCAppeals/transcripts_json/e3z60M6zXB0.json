As you all are aware, the COVID-19 pandemic has required our court to make adjustments in order to ensure that we can continue to hear cases for oral argument. And so we thank you for your patience in working with us on the Zoom remote oral argument. And the court staff have made every effort to prepare us, but  In the event of any technical difficulty, we ask your patience as we try to work through this for our arguments today. I wanted to remind counsel of the court's order dividing argument today into three different segments. The first segment will focus primarily on Iron Vine and second factors appeal from the judgment in favor of  Signicom on its tortious interference claim. In this segment, Ironvine and Second Factor shall be allotted 15 minutes, which they may divide between them as they see fit, including any time they choose to reserve for rebuttal. And Signicom shall be allotted 15 minutes. During the second segment, the focus will be primarily on Ironvine's appeal  from the judgment in favor of Signicom on its breach of contract claims. In this segment, Arnvine shall be allotted 10 minutes, including any time it chooses to reserve for rebuttal, and Signicom shall be allotted 10 minutes. And then in the third and final segment of the argument today, we'll focus primarily on Signicom's cross-claim, excuse me, cross-appeal from the dismissal of its civil conspiracy claim.  In this segment, Signicom shall be allotted 10 minutes, including any time it chooses to reserve for rebuttal. And Iron Vine and Second Factor shall be allotted 10 minutes, which they may divide between them as they see fit. And I'm Chief Judge Blackburn Rigsby, and I'm joined on the panel today by Judge Stephen Glickman and Judge Anthony or Tony Epstein, who is sitting by designation from our DCE.  Superior Court. So with that, good morning. And I would ask counsel to please state their names. Identify yourselves as we begin in the matter of Ironvine Security LLC versus Signicom Incorporated. Good morning, Your Honor.",

It's our view that, you know, that given that the overall the overall motions were made.  at both of those junctures, that what was said probably is going to be read to fairly encompass all the issues that are being addressed here. But I don't want to go too far out on a limb on that, because I want to confess to the court that I don't have a clear recollection of precisely what was stated in the record at those two junctures. I'd like to devote myself mainly just to two very discrete issues. One is with respect to the merits.  The facts, as I understand it, and I wasn't trial counsel, but as I understand it, the uncontested facts show that Signicom was terminated. Iron Vine had the right to terminate Signicom, and they exercised that right based on dissatisfaction with Signicom's performance.

I'm not sure. But I'm going to take those facts and answer the question predicated on the proposition that what Your Honor said is strictly correct. So my suggestion to Your Honor is that the nature of the tortious interference that is alleged in the complaint  that is encompassed, as I understand it, in the pretrial statement and that was reaffirmed repeatedly by plaintiff's counsel during the course of the trial, is that there was an inducement of the employees to terminate their relationships with Signicom. And so even if there was some planning along the lines that Your Honor just delineated,  that occurred earlier, there's still nothing tortious, nothing wrongful that occurs vis-a-vis actual contact between second factor and the employees until after the contract is terminated. If that's incorrect, I want to beg the court's pardon. Like I said, I wasn't trial counsel.

    "text": "Well, I'm so glad your honor asked that question, because what the count that I'm referring to here in the count that's an issue in segment one of this appellate argument is not the conspiracy count.  is the tortious interference count directly against our clients. And so with respect to tortious interference, at least as I understand the law, and I don't think there's any ambiguity about this based on all the cases that have been cited by both sides, in order to commit the substantive count, the substantive tort, as opposed to conspiracy, the substantive tort of tortious interference, second factor would have had to reach out to those employees because that's the crux of it. That's what constitutes the tortious interference. They would have had to reach out to them,  prior to the time, iron vine terminated sigma sigma com on the contract and there's no evidence in the record as I understand it that they did that, if I could be allowed just like I know I'm getting close to my five minutes I just wanted to speak to the waiver issue, because I do have some additional things to say on that and I'll be very brief with the courts permission, because I think they're, I'm, and again I think it was.  It was extremely helpful to the dialogue for Chief Judge Blackburn-Rigsby to cite the Washington Investment Partners case. I think that is a key case. And the distinctions in our record vis-a-vis that case are, I think, the key things to focus on here. So first, we have the hearing on April 12, 2018.  in which there is repeated suggestion to the court that there should be briefing. I mean, specifically by me. We'd like to brief this. There are a number of issues we'd like to brief, and the court says, no. I mean, emphatically. That's in the record at least two or three times. No, you had your opportunity when we talked about this during the course of the trial. You need to go across the street. We're done.  I mean that that kind of a dialogue on April 12 does not occur in Washington investment partners or any of the other cases that relies upon that's a critical distinction. There are a couple of other critical distinctions also. And this is just, you know, unfortunately, just kind of a one line in our brief, but I think it's critical that I highlighted in this argument, which is, if you look at the docket.  And the docket itself is a critical aspect of any appeal. It's the first item in any appendix. If you look at the docket entry for April 12, 2018, it specifically, and I looked at it again just this morning, it specifically states defendants argument for a directed verdict or judgment as of law, as of tortious interference is denied. So you have an on the record, unambiguous denial.  on April 12th, post verdict of the very motion, which the plaintiff is saying we should have made, which we all agree, I think can be made orally. And so the court construed us to having made it orally. And then the only other point I wanna note is, as my colleague, Mr. Roberts noted in his brief, there's a specific harmless error statute in the District of Columbia, which I don't think is addressed in these other cases, section 11-721E.  And this, from our standpoint, is, if anything, if there's any error with respect to raising it below, it's harmless error. And we think that the areas of error that we're highlighting are plain error and should be considered substantively by the court.",

I just don't think under those circumstances that it would be reasonable for a lawyer to disobey an explicit order of the trial court and go ahead and brief these issues, particularly when the docket indicates that there was a post-verdict ruling with respect to specifically the issue we're talking about here. So I'm not suggesting to the court that this was an optimal scenario. It's not. And I know that when what's behind Judge Glickman's question is the notion of like, did the  trial court have a full and fair opportunity to consider the merits of the insufficiency arguments that are being made here, which seems to me absolutely the appropriate thing to be focusing on. But under these special circumstances, it seems to me that it would not have been reasonable or appropriate to expect the lawyers at that hearing to follow up with briefs, given that we were specifically forbidden from doing so.

May it may please the court. Um, obviously, the court has the benefit of our briefs, but I want to highlight three reasons why this court should affirm the judgment below. First and foremost, appellants got their day in court. Three judges on the Superior Court determined there were tribal issues for the jury to resolve. This case was, in fact, tried to a jury jury returning unanimous verdict on all issues presented to it. Importantly,  None of the instructions given to that jury have been challenged before this court. None of the evidence presented to that jury has been challenged before this court. The verdict form used by that jury was, in fact, agreed to in advance by the parties. And again, it has not been challenged before this court. This is not one of those exceptional cases where three judges and seven jurors reached a conclusion that no reasonable person could have reached. Rather, this is simply a case of appellants disagreeing with the outcome here after they had the opportunity to fully present their case.  So mere disagreement with the jury is no basis to overturn the jury's verdict. Now, even if this court were inclined to second guess the jury, that brings me to my second point, which is none of the appellant's claims are properly before this court. The price of admission for presenting claims to this court is properly presenting those to the trial court in the first instance and properly preserving those claims and present them here. Now, appellants,  frame their disagreement with the jury in terms of sufficiency of the evidence that we've touched on already briefly, that runs right into Unitherm and its progeny saying basically the failure to provide a 50B motion or failure to submit a 50B motion after the jury comes back, not only is not proper, but the Supreme Court said it divests an appellate court of considering a sufficiency of the evidence argument.  We're exactly at the same point here in this case, where unquestionably, they did not submit a 50B motion after the jury returned its verdict.",

I understand that, but is there any question that he would have if they would have said, you said we can't file any post-trial motion, does that include Rule 50 motion? The only case we could find addressing that sort of scenario is the Belk case out of the Fourth Circuit, where they said we should be excused from filing the 50B motion because the judge was hostile and was not going to entertain a motion.  And the Fourth Circuit said, and I'll just quote real quickly, a lawyer has a duty to preserve issues on the record for his client. Rule 50B inherently accommodates such potential deterrence to filing, providing counsel with a period of time in which to detach from the pressures of trial to reflect and to carefully consider whether to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law without obtaining the judge's permission to file. So we have not found any precedent standing for the proposition that, you know,  If the judge is hostile to a 50B motion, it excuses you from your obligation to file it.

We think the Supreme Court established a clear, bright line  that it's an absolute price of admission that you've got to file your 50B motion in the first instance. To the extent there is any prejudice, we're deprived of the trial court's ability, the trial court's impression of the evidence as it came in. As the Supreme Court said in Unitherm, the requirement for a timely application for judgment after verdict is not an idle motion because it's an essential part of the rule firmly grounded in the principles of fairness. So for example,  That's also based on other Supreme Court precedent. Talking about the trial court is there to observe the evidence, to observe the witness as it comes in, in context, in a way that no written transcript could possibly impart on an appellate court.

Certainly, you've heard a lot of discussion about, you know,  what the jury possibly could have considered, not considered. Certainly the judge was there in the courtroom. He could see that the evidence that we presented, their counter evidence, they could see how the jury resolved those differences. They were all resolved in our favor. You don't get the benefit of the trial court's input on the full record in terms of credibility, whether or not certain actions could be believable or not believable. I mean, I'm happy to sort of walk through appellants,  how they've sort of changed their view of the facts throughout the life of this litigation. So it was real easy for the jury not to believe a balance when they told their stories and gave their excuses for why it is they shouldn't be held accountable. So I think you lose the benefit of that from the trial court who actually was in the room, heard the evidence as it came in, heard it in context. And going back to rule 50B just establishes a clear, bright line. I agree some rules of civil procedure provide certain amounts of discretion,  Rule 50B is pretty airtight, that it's a clear, bright line. Everybody knows about it. You've got ample time after judgment is entered, so it's not lost to the vagaries of trial. You have time to do a calm, considered, thoughtful approach to whether or not you want to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the jury returns its verdict. And the requirement that the trial court first pass on that is just a price of admission before the appellate court can pass on that.  Well, there are advantages, certainly, in having the opportunity to reflect over the entire trial and file a more thorough sufficiency argument or set of sufficiency arguments than could be assembled during the trial and that the judge could have in his or her mind.",

One question, it seems to me that, I'll posit to you, that the damages, regardless of what count it was, the damages that Signicom  asked for and proved, the only damages that Signicom asked for and proved, were lost profits on the Vanguard contract. Now, it seems to me that there's an overlap, and this is what I want you to explain to me, between the, there's really two overlaps, or maybe three overlaps. First of all, there's an overlap, it seems to me, between the,  damages on count nine, the tortious interference damages, and the damages awarded on breach of contract, such that if SignaCom got both those damages, it would be more than fully compensated. Second, the second overlap I was referring to is that it seems to me  is not only an overlap, but an inconsistency between the damages on count nine, the tortious interference count, and the damages on count 10. Now, I realize there's a third defendant in count 10, a conspiracy to tortiously interfere count. I realize there's a third defendant on count 10, who I guess is not encompassed in count nine, but I don't understand that to explain it.  And if you want, we can discuss why I think there's an inconsistency there. I don't understand why those damages weren't exactly the same. And then, of course, there's the conflict which the court, or not conflict, excuse me, the duplication the court acknowledged between the breach of contract damages and the damages on count 10.

Some we had existing contracts we could have placed them on right away. Some we had, there were other things in the works that we're working on getting in, placing these people in other positions. Again, part of what you have to remember is on December 15th,  We get a phone call saying, hey, we plan to terminate the contract as of February 8th. We don't find out until two weeks later because appellants basically told all the employees keep it quiet until Ray gives the thumbs up that you give your notice. So in this interim period, we are looking to place all the employees on different contracts. We have some that are, we need your resume right now because we got an existing contract we can put you on. Some we've got some opportunities to get you on.

    "text": "Sure. So we presented evidence that we've been performing on the State Department for well over five years on the Vanguard contract, probably 10 years before that.  In addition, we also showed the suggestion that we had performance issues is actually a pretext. We presented evidence. Mr. Geimer, who's the president of Ironvine, admitted they never once invoked any of the remedies available under the contract. They never, ever had issues. When they talk about, you know, this only became an issue in 2015 when Mr. Shanley and Second Factor and Ironvine and Mr. Geimer got together and started looking for opportunities to take positions away.  from Signikon. At that point, they start talking about all these different problems that had never been a problem before. So for example, there was testimony about how they were talking to the State Department customer. We showed evidence that before 2015, we talked to the State Department customer all the time without any issue, and that was absolutely how things got performed, and nobody had a problem with it. So the jury certainly heard conflicting information about these supposed performance issues, and they resolved it against the defendants in this case.  Further, I think we showed evidence that this was an ongoing requirement. We had special technical expertise available to perform this work. This work was going to be an ongoing requirement for the State Department. By the time we got to trial, it had already been two years of performing. The defendants were performing with our employees for the past two years in between the time they took the employees by the time we got to trial with no end in sight. And in fact, there was testimony offered that they were in a really good position  for the follow on contract that they were expecting 2021, I believe, whatever the 10 year period was up. So I think at best, there is a dispute about that, which was clearly resolved by the jury against defendants.",

    "text": " Thank you, Your Honor. One thing is very clear here. Signicom did an about face and it's brief in terms of damages. It actually argued that it was that the damages for tortuous interference awarded by the jury was for a different harm.  Not the harm resulting from the breach of the Vanguard contract, but for a different harm. And they specifically say, quote, this is on page 33, the verdict is supported by evidence that Signicom would have earned profits on the lost employees by assigning them to other current and future projects. In fact, they didn't introduce any evidence  of specific damages with respect to those other current and future projects. They're trying to basically  indicate to the court that, yes, there was evidence to support those claims for different harm, but there really was not. They actually were awarded, as been referred to, three years on the breach of contract, three years of lost profits, and one year for another loss, for the lost profits on the Vanguard profit. There was never any evidence introduced, period, as to other  future and current projects that they could have put these employees to work at. So clearly they are stuck with that and it's telling that they have now tried to argue in this case that in fact the jury's award was for  lost profits or losses related to other and future projects, which was not the case at all. I would also say that it's somewhat baffling to me that in this particular case, although the non-solicitation clause or the, actually, I'm sorry, the non-compete clause is six months.  only good for six months after the termination, that they were awarded four years of lost profits, four years when you total the total verdict, which is totally excessive and really is a miscarriage of justice.

There was discussion.  that there was going to be additional briefing, as opposed to what happened here, where, and I think it should be emphasized, you know, my argument at least I'm not just relying on, like, sort of the expression of hostility by the trial judge I didn't really think the trial judge was you know kind of quote unquote hostile. I thought he was clear as a bell.  I mean, he just couldn't have been more emphatic after he was asked like something like three times, once by Mr Wagman, two or three times by me about additional briefing he said no, no additional briefing, take it across the street. We're done.  I mean, that combined with the fact that the docket entry specifically says that the additional motion that Mr. Wagman says we should have filed was made and denied.

Can you address that legal point about why? Because you'd have to be arguing essentially that not only were they going to be terminated, but that they had no reasonable business expectancy beyond when you ended the contract.",

And in that case, the court pointed out, said there was no contrary evidence  that no contrary evidence that the company would not be able to make the profits. They point that out. Quote, no evidence was presented by GP that absent GP's move to Accenture, Accenture would have nonetheless moved the billet in question from PSS, end quote.  Now, here we have the evidence that there was just no question that Ironbine was not going to retain Signikov. That's the difference here. We had evidence, clear evidence, that they were not going to do so.  December 15th, they gave the notice that they were terminating this or not renewing this contract. That's a different situation. So that's clearly evidence that they were, that Signicom was no longer gonna have the opportunity to earn any profits on this Vanguard project. That's the distinction between the preferred systems solutions case and this particular case.  I also want to point out that even if you were to assume that they would be entitled to lost profits for the breach of the non-solicitation clause, the non-solicitation clause was good for one year. So after the one year was up, Ironvine could hire Signicom's employees. But if the jury credited Mr. Bellows' testimony,",

So when we talk about, you know, our third breach of contract claim that was count three that they violated that clearly by doing this exact type of conduct where they use a proxy or they use a straw man to accomplish what it is this, you know,  In sum and substance, this is meant to prevent, to protect our legitimate existing business interest. Otherwise, it lets them do an end run to revenue. How many of the six employees, this gets back to something I was asking you earlier, how many of the six employees did Ironbond actually have any communication with whatsoever about leaving? So we know certainly Wilbur was, so I believe five of the six,  And you see in the record, the only one I'm not sure about is Mr. Shifflett. And you see also Mr. Jarbo. If you look at PX 47, which is after they went to dinner and sort of divvied up the employees, who's going where. Mr. Jarbo is the one who sent the horribly offensive email that you've heard all about now. Iron Vine a week later saying, oh, we're gonna hire that guy.  I'm Mr Shanley approach Mr Gerber on behalf of Ironbine this Jarvis anyone know part of it, he's not going to go work for it. And then you see there's sort of a shifting later on. So, um,  They ended up trading that position for Mr. Sorry, second factor hired Mr. Schiff. Let's you see there's a there's a variance between the initial plan and what they were going to do. But certainly you see direct conversations. I'm sorry, you see conversations on behalf of the other companies with all the employees. Absolutely. In terms of Ironbine specifically, I know for a fact in the record, we can point to  his conversation with Mr. Wilbur. We can point to Dorothy Bainline. He had a conversation. He also testified. He had a similar conversation with all the rest of the operations staff, which included things like, don't worry about your employment agreement. You'll come work for us. You've been assigned the second factor. I believe it is PX 29. Give me a second. I'll get you there. So very clearly, they talked to  at least directly talk to all of them, indirectly talk, you know, talk to everybody, I'm sorry, directly talk to at least five of the six, indirectly talk to six of the six. And certainly they were coordinating. You can see Mr. Shanley's, actually, it came up as Mr. Shanley's response to, hey, I just talked to Dorothy. He says, okay, I'm gonna go meet with Shiflett tonight. I'll circle back, tell you how all that went. So clearly this is all coordinated. And the fact they're trying to, you know, if, you know,  It's almost mobster-like. I don't do my own talking. I let people do my talking for me.

And I think the plain language of the contract you just focused on is expressly put in place to avoid exactly this type of scenario where you put up a proxy or a strongman to circumvent your promises. And if I could go back to something we were talking about before, one of the issues we raised at trial, in terms of the discrepancy about would we have continued performing, would we not have continued performing,  You know, again, those are all factual issues. It was all presented to the jury, got resolved against them. As we pointed out, if these guys could have just hired anybody and started doing the work right away, they never would have entered into a subcontract with us in the first place for five years and paid us, you know, whatever they paid us for those first five years. The record also shows they didn't talk to any other, with one exception, after Jarvis says he's not coming on board, they didn't talk to any other employees.  They simply went after these people. In fact, with Wilbur, they offered him a job before ever seeing his resume. So it's not like they can say he just happened to be the most qualified. They absolutely went after him, targeted him. Mr. Shanley went to him, said, here's Mr. Garmer's telephone. Well, the SEIC folks and Mr. Shanley, while working on site, said, here's Mr. Garmer's telephone number. Give him a call. Mr. Garmer says, hey,  Respond to the posting on LinkedIn, and then let's get together for coffee tomorrow. So I have some basis to say you would apply, and we can have a conversation. And you look at the communications with SAIC, it's very clear. They plan on targeting these people from the get go. When SAIC comes in and says, hey, tell us how it's going. He says, it's going fantastic. With Ray Shanley's help, we've retained 100% of everybody on our wish list.  So the idea that this is just stuff anybody could have done, if that were true, they would have done it five years earlier. And the record completely contradicts the evidence they tried to present, and ultimately just went to the jury to resolve the difference.",

And it really goes to the question of whether or not this provision is legally enforceable, not the other facts dealing with, well, when did Mr. Geimer speak to certain people, so on and so forth.  The point here is that it is legally unenforceable for the very reason that Judge Whitman has addressed, namely that it could be easily, you could be in violation of this agreement just by merely talking to an employee and the employee quits because let's say, maybe you want to go in the military, maybe you want to do,  go to California, whatever it is you want to do, and that would be a violation. The point is under Virginia law, and then I cite to this Mantec decision, page 36 of the brief, this virtually the same language was held by the court to be legally under force, unenforceable under Virginia law, and it can't be corrected  By what they call blue penciling the contract. In other words, you can't exclude it. It's just, you know, I wondered about that.",

    "text": "Thank you. I would like to reserve two minutes for rebuttal if I could, please. I want to talk for a second about how we ended up with two different conspiracy claims in our complaint. As initially pleaded, we only pled common law civil conspiracy, which is ultimately count 10,  related to their joint efforts to tortiously interfere with our employee relationships. After we filed our initial complaint, Mr. Shanley and Second Factor filed a motion to dismiss, supported by a declaration from Mr. Shanley, basically alleging he could only be subject to Virginia courts because he was a Virginia resident. Second Factor was a Virginia entity. Most of the work  He doesn't support of the contract he does from his home in Virginia. He works on the contract from his home as well as facilities in Virginia, Maryland, and DC. Very specifically, he said the agreement to injure significant business or reputation, he doesn't use that exact words, but the agreement that's at issue here, he said that was governed by Virginia law and he executed it in Virginia. So with that, we filed an amended complaint, added count 11.  And the reason is there's a statutory prohibition on injuring someone in their business or reputation. There's a statutory prohibition on conspiracy to do so in Virginia. There's no analog under DC law. There's only the common law derivative liability for tort liability. So we see this as there's a strong interest in Virginia enforcing this provision.  There's no corollary interest in DC not enforcing this interest or having its laws applied to it. That's how we ended up with two claims. And again, there are two separate claims, different operative facts supporting each of them.",

Under DC, it's purely derivative under some existing common law tort, as opposed to a statutory prohibition in the district, I'm sorry, in Virginia that does not exist in the District of Columbia. That's why we kept saying there is no choice of law issue to resolve here. There's no competing interest involved. We have a Virginia,  Virginia statute involving two Virginia companies and a Virginia resident ganging up on a third Virginia entity for work that's going to be performed in DC and Virginia, except for a month from now, it's all going to be performed in Virginia. So certainly the focus was of this conspiracy was going to be in Virginia. We felt that harm at Signicom's headquarters in Virginia. So we think it's appropriate that it be brought, you know, this, you know, we think we met all the elements and it was appropriately brought. But there is no corresponding,  You know, there is no corresponding DC, and that's why it got dismissed as opposed to saying, okay, count 11 now has been changed to DC law. It was dismissed outright. Jury was never instructed on it. So I think we are talking about different causes of action supported by different operative facts, unquestionably related. I mean, it's all sort of part of the overall scheme. They couldn't have carried out their conspiracy to injure us without conspiring to tortiously interfere with our people.  in addition to things. But we see this as different. We also see this as a waiver issue. Literally, they raise this as the jury's walking back in to hear closing arguments. They filed dispositive motions.

There's no finding necessary talking about a Virginia connection or Virginia. Jury needs to make a fine. So for directed verdict. It's, it's not appropriate because there's no jury finding that needs to be made on the Virginia nexus. We did go back as a factual matter we offered Mr. Shanley's declaration talking about all the stuff he does in Virginia.  He affirmed during his testimony, all that was true. He reaffirmed it again during trial in front of everybody. So we have that in the record to establish our Virginia nexus to the extent that's necessary. However, this was used to dismiss our claim outright. So it was treated as a defense. And the cases they relied on, I forget the names off the top of my head, but those cases from the DC district court, federal district court, those looked at those cases using  The choice of law issue as a defense. They were raised under 12b motion. So they were treated as defense. In those cases, it was treated as a defense here because it totally defeated our case. We think you apply the law of defenses. Certainly, rule eight says you got to plead it. Certainly, by rule 16, by the time you get to your pretrial hearing, you got to raise and put it in the pretrial order. It just wasn't there. So this was absolutely a blindside blow that we never saw coming.

And, you know, of course, as has been, I think all agree during the course of this conversation, you know, a question, a key question is whether the nexus is principally to the District of Columbia or principally to Virginia. And that's dependent on trial evidence. It's not dependent on something Shanley executed before trial.  At the conclusion of the trial evidence, it became apparent that the nexus was so overwhelmingly in favor of the District of Columbia rather than Virginia.

If I've got that wrong, I don't have the statute in front of me, but I think that's the way it operates.

DC has a separate interest and we're going to apply the laws of DC. The outcome was DC doesn't have a law addressing this conduct. Therefore, it was dismissed in its entirety.  So I do agree with the idea that the judge determined, based on what was the couple of minutes he had to consider things, he determined DC law should apply. And because of that, because there is no analog under DC common law or statute, it was dismissed in its entirety instead of proceeding under DC law. If I could turn real quickly, a couple of points that were raised.  The idea that it has to be based on trial evidence, I don't believe is correct. In fact, if you look at the discussion the judge was having during his ruling, he was asking Mr. Geimer, where is your office located? I understand this. And there was other information coming in from outside the record. And again, the cases they relied upon, those were 12b motions. They were relied upon without trial evidence. The idea this had to wait until the very end of trial, I don't believe is accurate, combined with when you look  The benefit we have of raising it this late, we got to see the jury instructions that were negotiated and agreed to by the court before this was raised. And there's no requirement for the jury to make any finding of Virginia nexus, pardon, Virginia law, any of those types of things. Going back to, it's not enumerated in Rule 8. Every court that's considered the issue has determined that choice of law issues can be waived.  We started the Third Circuit case, which was collecting cases from around the country, saying every appellate court to consider the issue has determined that these can be waived. So the question is, at what point was it waived? Quite honestly, it comes up most often at summary judgment, where if the parties go to summary judgment, agreeing a certain law applies, the court says, I don't have to make an independent determination. I'm going to agree. Then it's waived at that point. So we can say it was waived at summary judgment. We can say it was waived at  You know, we think they had to plead it. There are enough exceptions to Rule 8 that certainly if they'd gotten in a dispositive motion during the two years we litigated this case, it'd be hard to argue. But the fact it's not in the pretrial order, the fact they waited till the very last moment of trial after the jury was instructed on the heightened burden of proof for this, it had to be waived somewhere in there. So our view is whether or not, however you want to characterize it, again, because it was used as a defense, we characterize it as a defense.  You want to call it a choice of law issue, unquestionably, it can be waived. It was waived at summary judgment or sometime well before the pretrial order.",
